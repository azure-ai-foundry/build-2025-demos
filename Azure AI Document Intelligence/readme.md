## Recently announced features or updates

### Document Intelligence
- [Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/?view=doc-intel-4.0.0)
- [Batch API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/concept-batch-analysis?view=doc-intel-4.0.0)
- [Read/Prebuild/Custom models via Document Intelligence Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/studio-overview?view=doc-intel-4.0.0&tabs=di-studio)

### Content Understanding
- Pro mode: Pro mode, currently limited to documents, is designed for scenarios where content understanding needs to go beyond surface-level extractionâ€”ideal for use cases that traditionally require postprocessing, human review and decision-making based on multiple data points and contextual references.
- Structured Document Outputs: Improved handling of tables spanning multiple pages, recognition of selection marks, and support for additional file types like .rtf, .xml, .csv, .msg, and .eml.
- Classifier API: Automatically categorize/split and route documents to appropriate processing pipelines.
- Video Analysis: Extract data across an entire video or break a video into  chapters automatically. Enrich metadata with face identification and descriptions that include facial images.
- Audio Understanding: Multi-speaker detection to identify roles in conversations, enhancing analysis in call center and meeting scenarios.
- Face API Preview: Detect, recognize, and enroll faces, enabling richer user-aware applications.
