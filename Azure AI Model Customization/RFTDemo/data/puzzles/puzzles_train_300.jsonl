Since $d \\in\\left[1,2^{k-1}-1\\right]$, the highest power of two that divides $d$ is less than $k-1$. If the grasshopper jumps in the direction opposite to the nearest trap, it will remain between the traps (since the other trap is farther away). The new distances to the traps are $2d$ and $2^{k}-2d$, both of which are divisible by a higher power of two than $d$. By continuing this process, we will reach a moment when both distances are divisible by $2^{k}$, which means they are 0 and $2^{k}$, i.e., the grasshopper has fallen into a trap.\n\nLet $N+1=2^{k} t$, where $t$ is an odd number greater than 1 (the power $k$ can be equal to 0).

Or if we distribute 13 items into 3 containers, at least one container will have at least 5 items. Or when distributing $2n+1$ items into 2 containers, at least one container will have at least $n+1$ items. Generally, when distributing at least $kn+1$ items into $k$ containers, at least one container will have at least $n+1$ items (we wrote this above for $k=2$ and $n=6$, as well as for $k=3$ and $n=4$, and for $k=2$ and general $n$). The \"items\" can be numbers, geometric shapes, people, statements, essentially anything. The containers can then represent any properties of the individual items. For example, we often divide integers into 2 containers based on whether they are even or odd (see introductory problem N2).\n\nIn our solution, we used the Dirichlet principle twice, each time for 2 containers.

Suppose the banker allows placing coins on the scales no more than once. From what largest number of coins can a lighter one be identified in $k$ weighings?\n\nIf at some weighing there are more than one coin on the scale, it will not be possible to identify the fake coin (you cannot weigh a coin a second time!). Therefore, at each weighing, only one coin is placed on each pan.\n\nIf the scales are not in balance, the fake coin is obvious. If they are in balance, the number of suspicious coins decreases by 2. Therefore, with $k$ weighings, one can identify the fake coin from $2k + 1$ coins.\n\nReturning to the original problem, let's denote the answer as $f(n)$. Suppose that in the first weighing, there are $s$ coins on each pan. If the scales are not in balance, it will be necessary to find the fake coin among $s$ coins, and only $n-1$ weighings remain. According to the proven result, $s \\leq 2(n-1) + 1 = 2n - 1$.\n\nIf the scales are in balance, we get the original problem for the coins that did not go on the scales (there are $f(n) - 2s$ of them) and $n-1$ weighings, so\n\n$$\nf(n) - 2s \\leq f(n-1)\n$$\n\nTherefore,\n\n$$\nf(n) \\leq f(n-1) + 2s \\leq f(n-1) + 2(2n - 1)\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\nf(n) \\leq 2(2n - 1) + 2(2n - 3) + \\ldots + 2 \\cdot 3 + f(1)\n$$\n\nSince it is easy to check that $f(1) = 3$, we have $f(n) \\leq 2n^2 + 1$ by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression.\n\nOn the other hand, if there are $2n^2 + 1$ coins and each time $s$ is taken to be maximal, i.e., $s = 2n - 1$ on the first step, $s = 2n - 3$ on the second, and so on, the expert will be able to identify the fake coin.

Subtracting it from $f_{1}(x)$, we get $1/x = f_{1}(x) - 1/2(f_{2}(x) - f_{3}(x) + 1)$.\n\nSince the division operation is not allowed, it is impossible to express $1/x$ using only the functions $f_{2}$ and $f_{3}$: if you multiply and add polynomials, you will get polynomials again, and the function $1/x$ is not a polynomial. The derivatives of the functions $f_{1}$ and $f_{3}$ at the point $x=1$ are 0. If the derivatives of two functions at the point 1 are 0, then the derivative of both their sum and their product is 0.

What minimum number of tests is required to determine the material of each ball if all the tests should be performed today?\n\n[i]Proposed by N. Vlasova, S. Berlov[/i]"}], "solution": "1. **Initial Setup and Problem Understanding**:\n   - We have 99 identical balls: 50 made of copper and 49 made of zinc.\n   - We can test pairs of balls to determine if they are made of the same metal.\n   - The goal is to determine the material of each ball with the minimum number of tests.\n\n2. **Upper Bound on Number of Tests**:\n   - Consider picking one ball and testing it with each of the other 98 balls.\n   - This will result in 98 tests.\n   - After these tests, we will have two sets: one set of balls that are the same as the chosen ball and another set that is different.\n   - Since we know there are 50 copper balls, the larger set will be the copper balls, and the smaller set will be the zinc balls.\n   - Therefore, 98 tests are sufficient to determine the material of each ball.\n\n3. **Lower Bound on Number of Tests**:\n   - We need to show that 97 tests are not sufficient.\n   - Consider the balls as vertices of a graph, and each test as an edge between two vertices.\n   - If we perform 97 tests, we will have 97 edges in the graph.\n   - A graph with 99 vertices and 97 edges is not connected (since a connected graph with 99 vertices must have at least 98 edges).\n   - Let \\(C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_k\\) be the connected components of the graph. Since the graph is not connected, \\(k \\geq 2\\).\n   - Each connected component is a tree (since it is acyclic and connected).\n   - The number of edges in a tree with \\(n\\) vertices is \\(n-1\\).\n   - Therefore, the total number of edges in the graph is \\(\\sum_{i=1}^k (|C_i| - 1) = 99 - k\\).\n   - Given that we have 97 edges, we have \\(99 - k = 97\\), so \\(k = 2\\).\n   - Thus, we have two trees \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\) with \\(|T_1| + |T_2| = 99\\).\n\n4. **Coloring and Consistency**:\n   - Without loss of generality, assume \\(|T_2|\\) is even.\n   - Label half of the vertices of \\(T_2\\) as blue (copper) and the other half as green (zinc).\n   - Label half (approximately) of the vertices of \\(T_1\\) in one color and the other half in a different color.\n   - Assign Boolean values to the edges based on whether the endpoints are the same color or not.\n   - We can have either \\(\\frac{1}{2}(|T_1| + 1) + \\frac{1}{2}|T_2| = 50\\) blue vertices or \\(\\frac{1}{2}(|T_1| - 1) + \\frac{1}{2}|T_2| = 49\\) blue vertices.\n   - Given only the Boolean values of the edges, we cannot determine which set of balls is copper and which is zinc.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since 97 tests are not sufficient to determine the material of each ball, the minimum number of tests required is 98.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{98}\\).", "final_answer": "98"}

With three rounds of walking, Raymond can never be certain. Indeed, if for each switch you note whether it is in the initial position or the flipped position in the three rounds, then you can get $2^{3}=8$ different patterns.

Next, we can deduce from the status of light $i+2$ whether the switch with $i+2$ and $i+3$ has been flipped or not. By continuing this process, we see that it is determined for all switches whether they have been flipped or not. In the second case, if it is precisely the switch with $i-1$ and $i$ that has been flipped, then it is also determined for all switches whether they have been flipped or not. Therefore, there are exactly two combinations of switches that result in the same status of the lights. If we choose one of these combinations and then flip all 15 switches again, the same lights will be on, so this must result in exactly the second combination of switches. If the first combination of switches contains an even number of switches, then the second combination contains 15 minus that number, so an odd number of switches.\n\nHowever, Raymond knows himself how many switches he has flipped. He can deduce from the situation of the lights which two combinations of switches are possible, and only one of these can match the number of switches he has flipped. Therefore, he can precisely determine which lights the switches he has flipped correspond to; he only does not know which is which within that group of switches.\n\nNow write the numbers 1 to 15 in binary notation. For this, a maximum of 4 digits are needed; pad with zeros if necessary so that each number is written with exactly 4 digits. Raymond numbers the switches with these binary numbers. In the first round, he flips the switches whose numbers in binary notation start with a 1 and notes the 8 corresponding light pairs. In the second round, he first resets all the switches and then chooses the numbers that have a 1 in the second position in binary notation. Similarly, in the third round, he chooses the third position in the binary notation, and in the fourth round, the fourth position. In each round, he can determine which light pairs the switches he has used correspond to (only not which is which). Since each switch corresponds to a unique combination of rounds, he can then figure out for each switch which light pair it controls. For example, if a certain light pair is turned on in the first round, not in the second round, in the third round, and also in the fourth round, then it corresponds to the switch with binary code 1011, which is switch 11. Therefore, he can succeed in four rounds of walking.", "final_answer": "4"}

On a regular die, any two opposite faces have a total of 7 dots.\n\nTake any small outer cube and one of its outer faces. If the number of dots on this face is $x$, then the face opposite to it has $7-x$ dots. According to the problem, the face that touches the $(7-x)$-faced side also has $7-x$ dots. The face opposite to this one has $7-(7-x)=x$ dots, the face that touches this one also has $x$ dots, and finally, the face that touches this one again has $7-x$ dots (see the figure).\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_09631cee7cda5a5e8dbdg-1.jpg?height=288&width=856&top_left_y=392&top_left_x=624)\n\nIt can be observed that this last face is on the surface of the large cube and can be uniquely matched to the face of the original small cube, as it is opposite to it. Therefore, the $6 \\cdot 3^{2}=54$ small faces on the surface of the large cube can be paired such that each face is in exactly one pair, and the sum of the dots on the faces in each pair is 7. Since $\\frac{54}{2}=27$ such pairs exist, the total number of dots on the surface of the cube is $27 \\cdot 7=189$.\n\nRemark.

Determine the number of nice sets containing the number 2008.\r\n\r\n[i]Author: Fedor Petrov[/i]"}], "solution": "1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   We need to determine the number of nice sets containing the number 2008. A set \\( X \\) of positive integers is called *nice* if for each pair \\( a, b \\in X \\), exactly one of the numbers \\( a + b \\) and \\( |a - b| \\) belongs to \\( X \\).\n\n2. **Initial Observations:**\n   Let \\( a \\in X \\) be an element of \\( X \\). We need to use the definition of a nice set to derive properties of \\( X \\). Specifically, we need to determine which multiples of \\( a \\) belong to \\( X \\).\n\n3. **Inductive Argument:**\n   We will prove by induction that \\( ka \\in X \\) if and only if \\( k \\) is not divisible by 3.\n   - **Base Case:** For \\( k = 1 \\), \\( a \\in X \\) by definition.\n   - **Inductive Step:**\n     - Assume \\( ka \\in X \\) for \\( k \\) not divisible by 3.\n     - Consider \\( 2a \\). If \\( 2a \\notin X \\), then \\( |a - a| = 0 \\notin X \\), which is true since 0 is not a positive integer.\n     - Now, consider \\( 3a \\). If \\( 3a \\in X \\), then for \\( a \\in X \\), \\( |3a - a| = 2a \\in X \\), which contradicts our assumption that \\( 2a \\notin X \\). Hence, \\( 3a \\notin X \\).\n     - For \\( 4a \\), if \\( 4a \\notin X \\), then \\( |4a - a| = 3a \\notin X \\), which is consistent with our previous result. Thus, \\( 4a \\in X \\).\n\n4. **Minimal Element Argument:**\n   Let \\( x \\in X \\) be the minimal element of \\( X \\). Suppose there is some \\( l \\in X \\) which is not divisible by \\( x \\). Applying our previous considerations to the multiples of \\( x \\) and \\( l \\), we see \\( x \\) and \\( l \\) must be divisible by the same power of 3 (otherwise some multiple of \\( 3x \\) would be in \\( X \\)).\n\n5. **Contradiction Argument:**\n   Choose the minimal \\( l \\in X \\) not divisible by \\( x \\) (assuming such exists). Then both \\( |l - x| \\) and \\( |l - 2x| \\) are less than \\( l \\) and not divisible by \\( x \\), so they can't be in \\( X \\). Hence, \\( l + x \\) and \\( l + 2x \\in X \\). But one of these numbers is divisible by a higher power of 3 than \\( x \\), leading to a contradiction.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   Thus, \\( X \\) consists only of multiples of \\( kx \\) for which \\( k \\) is not divisible by 3. Since 2008 is not divisible by 3, the answer follows.\n\n7. **Counting Nice Sets:**\n   The number of nice sets containing 2008 is equal to the number of divisors of 2008 that are not divisible by 3. The prime factorization of 2008 is \\( 2^3 \\times 251 \\). The divisors of 2008 are \\( 1, 2, 4, 8, 251, 502, 1004, 2008 \\). None of these are divisible by 3.\n\nThe final answer is \\( \\boxed{8} \\).", "final_answer": "8"}

When Vasya names a sum, Kolya inserts a card with a denomination less than the named sum, if such a card exists, and a card with the highest denomination from those he has on hand otherwise. In the first case, the card is called discarded, and in the second case, it is called realized. Clearly, Vasya receives money only from the realized cards, and the cards are realized in descending order of denominations. Let the largest payment be $n$ rubles and this payment realizes a card with a denomination of $m$ rubles, $m \\geq n$. Let's make two observations. First, by the time of this payment, cards with a denomination less than $n$ rubles have already been eaten (otherwise, Kolya would have inserted one of these into the ATM instead of the card with a denomination of $m$ rubles). Second, all these cards have been discarded. Indeed, a card with a denomination of $k$ rubles for $k < n$ could not have been realized before the card with a denomination of $m$ rubles, since $k < m$. Thus, the total number of realized cards does not exceed $100 - n + 1$.

Noting another curious fact, Francisco says:\n\n- Alina, your age is now double the age of Valentina.\n\na) Show that this could never have happened before and that, after the next birthday of Valentina, it will never happen again.\n\nThen, Alina, who was very clever, exclaimed:\n\n- Dad, exactly 10 years ago, the age of one of us three was double the age of another, and in 10 years, the same fact will happen again!\n\nb) It is known that the oldest of the daughters is over 30 years old. How old is Civela?"}], "solution": "Solution\n\na) It is clear that Alina is older than Valentina. Let's call the difference in age between Alina and Valentina $d$. Since they were born on the same day of the year, $d$ does not vary (note that this would not be true if they were born on different days, as in that case, the difference would change on the birthday of each one).\n\nIf Valentina's age today is $\\alpha$, then Alina's age must be $2 \\alpha$, so the age difference between the two is given by:\n\n$$\nd=2 \\alpha-\\alpha\n$$\n\nWe conclude that $d=\\alpha$, so Alina is $2 d$ years old and Valentina is $d$ years old.\n\nSuch a relationship between the ages of Alina and Valentina could not have happened before, as Valentina was younger than $d$ years old. It also will not happen again, as Valentina will be older than $d$ years.\n\nb) Let's call the age of the youngest daughter $A$, the age of the middle daughter $B$, and the age of the oldest daughter $C$. Let $x=B-A$ be the age difference between the two youngest, and $y=C-B$ be the age difference between the two oldest daughters. The age difference between the youngest and the oldest is therefore $C-A=x+y$. Since they were born on the same day of the year, these differences do not vary.\n\nIt is known that in each of the years 2004, 2014, and 2024, the age of one of the daughters was, is, or will be double the age of one of the others. For this, there are only 3 possibilities:\n\n(i) $B$ is double $A$.\n\n(ii) $C$ is double $B$.\n\n(iii) $C$ is double $A$.\n\nBy the reasoning used in part a), we know that each situation can only occur in one of the three years. Therefore, the three situations: (i), (ii), and (iii) must happen in the three years: 2004, 2014, and 2024, but we do not yet know in what order. Also, from part a), we know that:\n\n- When (i) happens, $B$ must be equal to $2 x$ and $A$ must be equal to $x$. Moreover, $C$ is equal to $B+y$, that is, $C$ must be equal to $2 x+y$.\n- When (ii) happens, $B=y, C=2 y$, and therefore, $A=y-x$.\n- When (iii) happens, $C=2(x+y), A=x+y$, and therefore, $B=2 x+y$.\n\nObserve that the ages of $A$ in cases (i), (ii), and (iii) are\n\n$$\nx, \\quad y-x \\quad \\text { and } \\quad x+y\n$$\n\nrespectively. Since $x<x+y$ and $y-x<x+y$, we conclude that $x+y$ is the largest of the three ages and, therefore, (iii) must happen in the year 2024. Only remains to see in which of the two years 2004 or 2014 each of the events in (i) and (ii) happens. Let's assume that (i) and (ii) happen in the years 2014 and 2004, respectively. Then, the ages of $A$ in the years 2004, 2014, and 2024 would be $y-x, x$, and $x+y$, respectively. Thus, we would have the equations\n\n$$\ny-x+10=x \\quad \\text { and } \\quad x+10=x+y\n$$\n\nSolving, we would have $x=10$ and $y=10$. But in that case, $C$ would be today equal to $2 x+y=30$. But the oldest daughter is more than 30 years old, as stated in the problem. We discard, then, this possibility.\n\nWe know then that (i) and (ii) happen in the years 2004 and 2014, respectively. Then, the ages of $A$ in the years 2004, 2014, and 2024 are $x, y-x$, and $x+y$, respectively. Therefore, we have that\n\n$$\nx+10=y-x \\quad \\text { and } \\quad y-x+10=x+y .\n$$\n\nSolving, we get $x=5$ and $y=20$. Finally, the ages of Francisco's daughters today are equal to\n\n$$\ny-x=15, \\quad y=20 \\quad \\text { and } \\quad 2 y=40\n$$\n\nSince Alina's age must be double Valentina's age, the ages of Alina and Valentina must be 40 and 20, respectively.

This is the reasoning by recurrence.\n\nIt should be noted that both parts of the proof are important, even if the first is often quite obvious. One must not forget to initialize the recurrence, that is, to prove that the property is true for $n=0$. One can start the recurrence at a value other than 0, for example, at $1, 2, \\cdots$ or $K$; it will then be necessary to prove (initialization) that the property is true for $n=K$, and then (induction) that for $n \\geqslant K$, if it is true for $n$, it is still true for $n+1$.\n\nIt should also be noted that induction has some variants. For example, it sometimes happens that one has to prove that if the property is true for all integers $k \\leqslant n$, then it is true for $n+1$.", "final_answer": "4"}

But if $a_{2}=1$, then among the digits of the number $X$ there is a two, which, obviously, can only be the digit $a_{1}$. Thus, in the decimal representation of $X$, only the digits $a_{0}(=i), a_{1}=2, a_{2}=1$ and $a_{i}=1$ are non-zero, i.e., among the digits of $X$ there are $i$ zeros, 2 ones, 1 two, and 1 digit $i$, from which (since $X$ is 10-digit) $i=10-2-1-1=6$.\n\nThus, $X=6210001000$ (it is easy to check that this number indeed satisfies all the conditions of the problem).", "final_answer": "6210001000"}

We ask about the sums $a+b+c, a+b+d$, $a+b+e, c+d+e$. Then, by adding the first three sums and subtracting the fourth from the result, we get $3(a+b)$, then $a+b$ and, by adding $c+d+e$ to the result, the sum of all five numbers.\n\nSuppose we managed to get by with three questions. Let's call the presence of a card in a question an occurrence. If there is a card with three occurrences, then we increase the number on it by 2, and decrease all other numbers by 1. Then the answers to all three questions will not change, but the sum of all numbers will decrease by 2. Therefore, it is impossible to determine this sum with such three questions. This means that each card has no more than two occurrences, and this is only possible if four cards have two occurrences each, and one has one. By changing the notation if necessary, we can assume that the single occurrence is on card $e$, and one of the questions is $-a+b+c$. Then in another question without card $e$, two of the three cards $a, b, c$ must be present. By changing the notation if necessary, we can assume that this is the question $a+b+d$. Then in the third question, neither of the cards $a$ and $b$ can be present, so this is the question $c+d+e$. But then, by increasing each of the numbers $a$ and $e$ by 2 and simultaneously decreasing each of the numbers $b, c$, and $d$ by 1, the answers to all three questions will not change, but the sum of all five numbers will increase by 1. Therefore, in this case, it is also impossible to determine the sum of all five numbers.", "final_answer": "4"}

The captain proposes a way to divide the treasure (i.e., how many coins each pirate should receive: each pirate will receive a non-negative integer number of coins; different pirates may receive different numbers of coins). After this, the other five pirates vote on the captain's proposal. A pirate will vote \"for\" only if they receive more coins than each of their two neighbors. The proposal is accepted if at least three out of the five crew members vote \"for.\"\n\nWhat is the maximum number of coins the captain can get with this method of dividing the treasure?"}], "solution": "Answer: 59.\n\nSolution variant 1. Let's number the pirates clockwise, starting from the captain: First, Second, ..., Fifth. The main observation in this problem is:\n\ntwo pirates sitting next to each other cannot both vote \"for\": one of them will not vote \"for\" because the captain offers no more to him than to his neighbor.\n\nTherefore, for three to vote \"for,\" they must be the First, Third, and Fifth - the proof of this fact is detailed in the comment. Then, if the captain keeps $x$ coins for himself, he must offer at least $x+1$ coins to the First and Fifth, and at least 1 coin to the Third, so they vote \"for.\" Thus, the total number of coins should be at least $3x+3$, from which $3x+3 \\leqslant 180, x \\leqslant 59$.\n\nNote that so far we have only proven that the captain cannot get more than 59 coins. From our reasoning, it is easy to construct an example where he can get exactly 59: it is sufficient to offer 60 coins to the First and Fifth, one coin to the Third, and nothing to the Second and Fourth.\n\nComment. The intuitive statement about the First, Third, and Fifth is rigorously proven through partitioning into pairs. From the pair First-Second, no more than one will vote \"for,\" just as from the pair Third-Fourth. Therefore, the Fifth must definitely vote \"for.\" Similarly, the First must vote \"for.\" But then the Second and Fourth do not vote \"for,\" so the Third votes \"for.\"", "final_answer": "59"}

The total difference of 400 could have accumulated only if there were no fewer than 200 liars.\n\nLet's divide all the people sitting at the table into groups of consecutive knights and groups of consecutive liars.

For example, the digit parity of 29 is the parity of \\(2 + 9 = 11\\), which is odd.\n\n2. **Sequence Rearrangement**: Let \\(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{100}\\) be the rearranged sequence. We need to show that \\(a_k\\) and \\(a_{k+10}\\) cannot both remain in their original places.\n\n3. **Parity of Consecutive Terms**: Note that the digit parity of consecutive terms must be different. This is because each term is obtained from the previous one by increasing or decreasing one of its digits by 1, which changes the sum of the digits by 1, thus changing its parity.\n\n4. **Contradiction Argument**: Suppose \\(a_k\\) and \\(a_{k+10}\\) both remain in their original places. There are 10 terms between them. Since the digit parity of consecutive terms must be different, there must be an odd number of terms between \\(a_k\\) and \\(a_{k+10}\\) to maintain alternating parity.

This would mean: The digit $p$ would also appear with the count 1. However, since according to (6) all 10 digits of $n$ are already 0, 1, or 2, this is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, and because of (2), $a_{0} \\geq 3$ must hold, and the counts $8-k$ and 1 of the digits 1 and 2 among the $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{9}$ mentioned in (5) are already these counts among all $a_{\\nu}$. Together with the count $k$ of the digit 0, this gives the count 9 for the digits 0, 1, and 2. Thus, exactly one digit greater than 2 must appear among the $a_{\\nu}$; this must therefore be the digit $a_{0}=k$. This statement in turn means: $a_{k}=1$.\n\nSince, as noted in (5), exactly one of the digits is 2, i.e., $a_{2}=1$, the count $a_{1}$ of the ones is positive. Thus, four positive $a_{\\nu}$ have already been verified; their sum is $a_{0}+a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{k}=k+(8-k)+1+1=10$.\n\nBecause of (1), the remaining six $a_{\\nu}$ must be 0; thus, the count of zeros $a_{0}=6$ is determined, and in total it has been found: $n$ must be the number 6210001000.\n\nIndeed, the decimal representation of this number has exactly 6 zeros, 2 ones, one two, one six, and none of the digits three, four, five, seven, eight, nine.

A \"yes\" answer would be given by either a knight on an island with exactly 60 knights, or a liar if the number of knights is different. A \"no\" answer would be given by either a liar on an island with 59 knights, or a knight if the number of knights is different. Therefore, on the 7 islands where everyone answered \"yes\" to the first question, the number of knights is either 60 or 0; on the other 10 islands, the number of knights is either 59 or 119.\n2) For the second question, regardless of who answers, a \"yes\" answer indicates that the number of knights is less than half, and a \"no\" answer indicates that the number of liars is less than half. Therefore, on the 7 islands where everyone answered \"no\" to the second question, the number of knights is at least 60 (either 60 or 119); on the other 10 islands, the number of knights is no more than 59 (either 59 or 0).\n3) Let $x$ be the number of islands with 60 knights, and $y$ be the number of islands with 59 knights; then (see point 1) on 7 - $x$ islands there are 0 knights, and on 10 - $y$ islands there are 119 knights. From point 2, we get: $x + (10 - y) = 7, y + (7 - x) = 10$. Both equations are equivalent to the equation $y - x = 3$.\n4) Calculate the total number of knights:\n\n$60 \\cdot x + 59 \\cdot y + (7 - x) \\cdot 0 + (10 - y) \\cdot 119 = 60x + 59(x + 3) + 119(7 - x) = 59 \\cdot 3 + 119 \\cdot 7 = 1010$.\n\nTherefore, the number of liars is 1013.\n\nCriteria.

When $n=2018$, the magician and the assistant can agree that for $i=1,2, \\cdots, 2017$, if the assistant keeps the $i$-th card face up, the magician will guess that the 2018-th card is of the $i$-th color. This way, the magic trick can be completed.\n\nAssume for some positive integer $n \\leqslant 2017$, the magic trick can be completed.\n\nFor convenience, use $(a, i)$ to denote that the $a$-th card is of the $i$-th color, where $1 \\leqslant a \\leqslant n, 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant 2017$.\n\nFor $n$ cards, note that the number of cards of each color is 1000000 (greater than $n$), so there are $2017^{n}$ different states (each position has 2017 possible colors). Each state is equivalent to a set of the form\n$$\n\\left\\{\\left(1, i_{1}\\right),\\left(2, i_{2}\\right), \\cdots,\\left(n, i_{n}\\right)\\right\\}\n$$\nwhere $i_{1}, i_{2}, \\cdots, i_{n} \\in\\{1,2, \\cdots, 2017\\}$.\nFor any $a, i$, since when the magician sees $(a, i)$, they can always guess at least one $(b, j)(b \\neq a)$, and the number of states containing $(a, i)$ and $(b, j)$ is only $2017^{n-2}$, the total number of different states the magician can guess (i.e., $2017^{n}$) does not exceed $2017 \\times 2017^{n-2} n$.\nThus, $n \\geqslant 2017$.\nThis indicates that $n$ can only be 2017. Therefore, from any $(a, i)$, the $(b, j)(b \\neq a)$ that can be guessed is unique.\n\nTherefore, draw an edge from $(a, i)$ to $(b, j)$, denoted as $(a, i) \\rightarrow(b, j)$, and call $a, b$ \"associated\" (association is mutual, i.e., $b, a$ are also associated), and any two different guesses $(a, i) \\rightarrow(b, j)$ and $(c, k) \\rightarrow(d, l)$ cannot correspond to the same state.\nThis indicates that at least one of $c, d$ belongs to $\\{a, b\\}$.\nThe following lemma is proved.\nLemma If $(a, i) \\rightarrow(b, j)$, then there must exist $k \\neq i$ such that $(b, j) \\rightarrow(a, k)$.\n\nProof Suppose $(b, j) \\rightarrow(c, k)$. If $c \\neq a$ or $(c, k)=(a, i)$, then a state containing $(a, i), (b, j), (c, k)$ has two guesses $(a, i) \\rightarrow(b, j)$ and $(b, j) \\rightarrow(c, k)$, which is a contradiction.\nThus, there must exist a $k \\neq i$ such that\n$(b, j) \\rightarrow(a, k)$.\nThe lemma is proved.\nAssume without loss of generality that 1 and 2 are associated.\nNote that 3 must be associated with another number $a$. By the previous discussion, $a \\in\\{1,2\\}$, assume without loss of generality that $a=1$.\n\nAt this point, for any $b(4 \\leqslant b \\leqslant 2017)$, since $b$ must be associated with another number $c$, and 1 and 2 are associated, 1 and 3 are associated, thus $c \\in\\{1,2\\}, c \\in\\{1,3\\}$.

Therefore, \\(a_i > a_{i+1}\\) for any \\(i\\) is impossible, as the sequence would decrease forever, which is not possible since each \\(a_i\\) is positive. Hence, \\(a_i\\) is increasing (not necessarily strictly).\n\n2. If \\(a_i = a_j\\), then \\(a_{i-1} = a_{j-1}\\) as well.

The number of \\(i\\) such that \\(a_{n+1} + c < a_i \\leq a_{n+2} + c\\) is \\(a_{n+1} - a_n\\).

If \\(a_{i+1} - a_i\\) eventually becomes unbounded, then \\(a_{k+1} - a_k > c\\) for large enough \\(k\\). As a result, the number of \\(i\\) such that \\(a_i \\leq a_{n+1} + c\\) becomes \\(n + 1\\) for large enough \\(n\\), implying \\(a_n = n + 1\\) for large enough \\(n\\). So \\(a_{n+1} - a_n = 1\\) for large enough \\(n\\), which is absurd. Therefore, \\(a_{n+1} - a_n\\) eventually converges to some fixed positive integer, say \\(b\\).\n\n5.

If we look at the time as a six-digit number, two moments of time are compared in the same way as ordinary numbers: the time is greater, the greater the first digit; if the first digits are the same, the second is compared, and so on. Therefore, we will try to keep as many of the first digits of $23: 59: 59$ as possible. The maximum number of first digits that can be left is three, since otherwise more than two digits different from 2 and 0 will remain. Let's try to find a time that starts with $23: 5 *: * *$.

We will consider the statement of each of the two hundred students as the first phrase, and the statement of the remaining as the second.\n\nFirst method. Note that not all students are liars, otherwise there would be no one to say the first phrase. If the second phrase was spoken by a knight, then at the party there are 200 liars and 101 knights. In this case, among those who spoke the first phrase, there are liars. But in this case, a liar could not have said that if he left the hall, then among the remaining students, the majority would be liars. Therefore, there are no knights among those who spoke the second phrase. If the first phrase was spoken by a knight, then there are no more than 150 knights.

Therefore, the first phrase was spoken by both liars and knights. If the first phrase was spoken by a liar, then there are no more than 151 liars.

Let's look at how the colored points are arranged when no new moves are possible. If there are two adjacent uncolored points, one of them can be colored. Therefore, in the final position, all points are divided into groups of consecutive colored points, separated by single uncolored points. Within each group, the colors of the points alternate. If one group ends with a blue (red) point, the next group begins with a red (respectively blue) point, otherwise the point between the indicated groups can be colored. Therefore, if we remove the uncolored points, we get an alternation of red and blue points - meaning there are an equal number of red and blue points, and the total number of colored points is even. It remains to note that after any move by the first player, we have an odd number of colored points, and after any move by the second player, their number becomes even.

Then, \\( f(a+1) - f(a) = d \\) for all \\( a \\in \\mathbb{N} \\setminus \\{2\\} \\).\n\n4. By another application of Lemma 2, we obtain \\( f(3) - f(2) = f(11298347284) - f(11298347283) = d \\).

From the second property \\( f(x - 10) = f(-x - 10) \\), we can rewrite it as:\n   \\[\n   f((x + 10) - 10) = f(-(x + 10) - 10) \\implies f(x) = f(-x - 20)\n   \\]\n   This shows that \\( f \\) is symmetric about \\( x = -10 \\).\n\n4. Combining these symmetries, we get:\n   \\[\n   f(x) = f(18 - x) = f(x - 38)\n   \\]\n   This implies that \\( f \\) has a period of 38.\n\n5. Since \\( f \\) is periodic with period 38, we can find the zeros of \\( f \\) within the interval \\([0, 2014]\\). Given \\( f(0) = 0 \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   f(38n) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all integers } n\n   \\]\n   and since \\( f(x) = f(18 - x) \\), we also have:\n   \\[\n   f(38n + 18) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all integers } n\n   \\]\n\n6. To find the number of zeros in \\([0, 2014]\\), we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{For } f(38n) = 0: \\quad 38n \\leq 2014 \\implies n \\leq \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2014}{38} \\right\\rfloor = 53\n   \\]\n   This gives us 54 zeros (including \\( n = 0 \\)).\n\n7. Similarly, for \\( f(38n + 18) = 0 \\):\n   \\[\n   38n + 18 \\leq 2014 \\implies 38n \\leq 1996 \\implies n \\leq \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1996}{38} \\right\\rfloor = 52\n   \\]\n   This gives us 53 zeros.\n\n8. Therefore, the total number of zeros in \\([0, 2014]\\) is:\n   \\[\n   54 + 53 = 107\n   \\]\n\n9. To show that this minimum is achievable, consider the function:\n   \\[\n   f(x) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi(x - 9)}{19}\\right) - \\cos\\left(\\frac{9\\pi}{19}\\right)\n   \\]\n   This function has zeros precisely at \\( x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{38} \\) and \\( x \\equiv 18 \\pmod{38} \\).\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{107}\\).", "final_answer": "107"}

But 39 has no factors except 1, 3, 13 and 39, the total of the cards must be at least 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, and the number of rounds is at least 2. Hence there were 3 rounds and the cards total 13. The highest score was 20, so the highest card is at least 7. The score of 10 included at least one highest card, so the highest card is at most 8. The lowest card is at most 2, because if it was higher then the highest card would be at most 13 - 3 - 4 = 6, whereas we know it is at least 7. Thus the possibilities for the cards are: 2, 3, 8; 2, 4, 7; 1, 4, 8; 1, 5, 7. But the only one of these that allows a score of 20 is 1, 4, 8.

A player win the game if she removes the last marble from the table.\nDetermine the smallest number $N\\geq 100000$ such that Berta can enforce a victory if there are exactly $N$ marbles on the tale in the beginning."}], "solution": "1. **Initial Analysis**:\n   - Anna and Berta take turns removing marbles.\n   - Anna starts first.\n   - The player can remove \\( k \\) marbles where \\( k \\) is either:\n     - An even number with \\( k \\leq \\frac{n}{2} \\), or\n     - An odd number with \\( \\frac{n}{2} \\leq k \\leq n \\).\n   - The player who removes the last marble wins.\n\n2. **Odd Number of Marbles**:\n   - If the number of marbles \\( n \\) is odd, Anna can always win by taking all the marbles in her first turn.\n\n3. **Even Number of Marbles**:\n   - If \\( n \\) is even, the strategy changes. The first player to take an odd number of marbles leaves an odd number of marbles for the opponent, who can then take all remaining marbles and win.\n   - Therefore, players will prefer to take an even number of marbles \\( k \\leq \\frac{n}{2} \\).\n\n4. **Special Form \\( 2^m - 2 \\)**:\n   - Consider the number of marbles \\( n \\) in the form \\( 2^m - 2 \\) for some \\( m \\geq 2 \\).\n   - If \\( k \\) is even and \\( k \\leq 2^{m-1} - 2 \\), then after removing \\( k \\) marbles, the number of marbles left is \\( 2^m - 2 - k \\).\n   - Since \\( 2^{m-1} - 2 < 2^m - 2 - k < 2^m - 2 \\), the number of marbles left is not of the form \\( 2^m - 2 \\).\n\n5. **General Case**:\n   - Assume \\( 2^m - 2 < n < 2^{m+1} - 2 \\) for some \\( m \\geq 2 \\).\n   - Since \\( n \\) is even, \\( n \\leq 2^{m+1} - 4 \\) and thus \\( \\frac{n}{2} \\leq 2^m - 2 \\).\n   - The player can remove \\( n - (2^m - 2) \\) marbles, leaving \\( 2^m - 2 \\) marbles on the table.\n   - This ensures that the number of marbles is of the form \\( 2^m - 2 \\) when the opponent's turn comes.\n\n6. **Winning Strategy**:\n   - If the number of marbles is of the form \\( 2^m - 2 \\), the player not taking the turn can always ensure that the number of marbles remains in this form.\n   - Eventually, the number of marbles will be reduced to 2, and the player to take the turn will lose.\n\n7. **Finding the Smallest \\( N \\geq 100000 \\)**:\n   - We need to find the smallest \\( N \\geq 100000 \\) such that \\( N = 2^m - 2 \\) for some \\( m \\geq 2 \\).\n   - Calculate \\( 2^m - 2 \\) for \\( m \\) such that \\( 2^m - 2 \\geq 100000 \\).\n\n   \\[\n   2^{17} = 131072 \\implies 2^{17} - 2 = 131070\n   \\]\n\n   - Therefore, the smallest \\( N \\geq 100000 \\) is \\( 131070 \\).\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{131070}\\)", "final_answer": "131070"}

At the time of their meeting, Peter and Pavel were $1 + 8 + x + y$ and $1 + 9 + u + v$ years old, respectively. We can determine the year of their meeting in two ways. Since Peter's age at that time was equal to the sum of the digits of his birth year, the meeting took place in the year $1800 + 10 x + y + 9 + x + y$. On the other hand, Pavel's age was also equal to the sum of the digits of his birth year, so the meeting took place in the year $1900 + 10 u + v + 10 + u + v$. Therefore, $1800 + 10 x + y + 9 + x + y = 1900 + 10 u + v + 10 + u + v$.\n\nAfter simplifications, the equation transforms to $11(x - u) + 2(y - v) = 101$.

Pavel is older than Peter by\n\n$1900 + 10 u + v - 1800 - 10 x - y = 100 - 10(x - u) - (y - v) = 100 - 90 - 1 = 9$ years.\n\nWe need to consider two more cases: Peter could have been born in 1900 (which also belongs to the 19th century), or Pavel in 2000. In the first case, the meeting would have taken place in 1910, meaning Pavel was born no earlier than 1901 and no later than 1910, and he could not have been less than 11 years old at the time of the meeting. This is a contradiction. In the second case, the meeting would have taken place in 2002, and Peter would have been at least 102 years old at that time, which is also impossible, as the sum of the digits of any integer from 1801 to 1900 is no more than 27.\n\n## Answer\n\n9 years.", "final_answer": "9"}

It is known that the Jackal always lies, the Lion tells the truth, the Parrot simply repeats the last heard answer (and if asked first, will answer randomly), and the Giraffe gives an honest answer but to the previous question asked to him (and to the first question, answers randomly). The wise Hedgehog, in the fog, stumbled upon the Jackal, the Lion, the Parrot, and the Giraffe and decided to find out in what order they stood. By asking each of them in turn, \"Are you the Jackal?\", he only figured out where the Giraffe was. Asking everyone in the same order, \"Are you the Giraffe?\", he was able to understand where the Jackal was, but full clarity did not come.

So, in what order did they stand?"}], "solution": "Answer: Parrot, Lion, Giraffe, Jackal.\n\nSolution. To the first question \"Are you a Jackal?\" the Lion and the Jackal would definitely say \"no.\" Therefore, the Hedgehog could only identify the Giraffe and not the Parrot in one case: if the Giraffe answered \"Yes\" and the Parrot answered \"No.\" The same can be said about the second question \"Are you a Giraffe?\" - to which the Lion and the Giraffe would say \"No\" (the Giraffe thinks it is being asked if it is a Jackal), which means the Jackal is recognized because he alone said \"Yes.\"\n\nSince the answer of the first animal to the third question was enough for the Hedgehog to determine all of them (and before this answer, there was not enough information), the first one could not be the Giraffe or the Jackal (their answers the Hedgehog could predict in advance, and they would not have told him anything new). The first one could not be the Lion either (he would have answered \"no\" to the third question), so the first one was the Parrot, who repeated the fourth one's answer to the previous question. Now it is clear that the fourth one is the Jackal. We are left with two possible arrangements:\n\n(1): Parrot, Giraffe, Lion, Jackal and (2): Parrot, Lion, Giraffe, Jackal. Let's consider them.\n\nIf the order (1) had been the case, the Hedgehog would have already understood after the first questioning that the third one was not the Parrot, since he did not repeat the second one's answer. Then, after the second questioning (when he knew both the Giraffe and the Jackal), everything would have been clearly determined, and the last question would not have been necessary. However, in the case of the order (2), the variants Parrot, Lion, Giraffe, Jackal and Lion, Parrot, Giraffe, Jackal would indeed not have been distinguishable until the last question.", "final_answer": "Parrot,Lion,Giraffe,Jackal"}
