Two squares on the path are traps. There are $N$ squares between the traps, and one of them is where the hopper stands. Before each hop, we choose a random natural number $X$, after which the hopper jumps $X$ squares to the left or right (at its own choice). During the game, we can see where the hopper is. For which $N$ can we choose the numbers so that we can definitely trap the hopper, no matter where it initially stood and regardless of how it chooses the directions for jumping?", "final_answer": "2^{k}-1", "solution": "Solution. We will prove that when $N=2^{k}-1$, the grasshopper can always be caught in a trap. We consider an integer numbering of the squares, where the traps have numbers 0 and $N+1$. If the grasshopper is between the traps in a square with number $x$, then the distances to the traps are equal to $x$ and $N-x$.\n\nLet $N+1=2^{k}$. We will show that if before each jump we choose a number equal to the distance $d$ to the nearest trap, the grasshopper will be caught in a trap. Since $d \\in\\left[1,2^{k-1}-1\\right]$, the highest power of two that divides $d$ is less than $k-1$. If the grasshopper jumps in the direction opposite to the nearest trap, it will remain between the traps (since the other trap is farther away). The new distances to the traps are $2d$ and $2^{k}-2d$, both of which are divisible by a higher power of two than $d$. By continuing this process, we will reach a moment when both distances are divisible by $2^{k}$, which means they are 0 and $2^{k}$, i.e., the grasshopper has fallen into a trap.\n\nLet $N+1=2^{k} t$, where $t$ is an odd number greater than 1 (the power $k$ can be equal to 0). We will call traps all squares with numbers that are multiples of $t$. If at any moment the grasshopper is not in a trap, then it is not in the middle between two traps (the middle between traps $at$ and $bt$ is $\\frac{(a+b)t}{2}$, which is either a trap or not an integer). This means that with any number we choose, the grasshopper can make a jump, avoiding the trap.\n\nThus, we have proved that only when $N$ is of the form $2^{k}-1$ do we have a strategy for catching the grasshopper.\n\nComment. Most participants noticed that when $N=2^{k}-1$, the grasshopper can be caught in a trap. For the completeness of the solution, it must also be explained why in other cases the grasshopper has a saving strategy."}}

In part b) of the given solution, we used a fact known as the **Dirichlet principle** or the **pigeonhole principle**.

Or if we distribute 13 items into 3 containers, at least one container will have at least 5 items. Or when distributing $2n+1$ items into 2 containers, at least one container will have at least $n+1$ items. Generally, when distributing at least $kn+1$ items into $k$ containers, at least one container will have at least $n+1$ items (we wrote this above for $k=2$ and $n=6$, as well as for $k=3$ and $n=4$, and for $k=2$ and general $n$). The \"items\" can be numbers, geometric shapes, people, statements, essentially anything. The containers can then represent any properties of the individual items. For example, we often divide integers into 2 containers based on whether they are even or odd (see introductory problem N2).\n\nIn our solution, we used the Dirichlet principle twice, each time for 2 containers. In the first case, the siblings played the role of \"items\" and gender (male/female) played the role of \"containers\". In the second case, the \"items\" were the statements and the \"containers\" were statements about sisters and statements about brothers.\n\nNOTE. Let's show that the explanation of part b) of the solution can also be presented differently.

What is the maximum number of coins the banker can have so that the expert can definitely identify the counterfeit one in $n$ weighings?", "final_answer": "2n^2+1", "solution": "Let's first solve a simpler problem. Suppose the banker allows placing coins on the scales no more than once. From what largest number of coins can a lighter one be identified in $k$ weighings?\n\nIf at some weighing there are more than one coin on the scale, it will not be possible to identify the fake coin (you cannot weigh a coin a second time!). Therefore, at each weighing, only one coin is placed on each pan.\n\nIf the scales are not in balance, the fake coin is obvious. If they are in balance, the number of suspicious coins decreases by 2. Therefore, with $k$ weighings, one can identify the fake coin from $2k + 1$ coins.\n\nReturning to the original problem, let's denote the answer as $f(n)$. Suppose that in the first weighing, there are $s$ coins on each pan. If the scales are not in balance, it will be necessary to find the fake coin among $s$ coins, and only $n-1$ weighings remain. According to the proven result, $s \\leq 2(n-1) + 1 = 2n - 1$.\n\nIf the scales are in balance, we get the original problem for the coins that did not go on the scales (there are $f(n) - 2s$ of them) and $n-1$ weighings, so\n\n$$\nf(n) - 2s \\leq f(n-1)\n$$\n\nTherefore,\n\n$$\nf(n) \\leq f(n-1) + 2s \\leq f(n-1) + 2(2n - 1)\n$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$\nf(n) \\leq 2(2n - 1) + 2(2n - 3) + \\ldots + 2 \\cdot 3 + f(1)\n$$\n\nSince it is easy to check that $f(1) = 3$, we have $f(n) \\leq 2n^2 + 1$ by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression.\n\nOn the other hand, if there are $2n^2 + 1$ coins and each time $s$ is taken to be maximal, i.e., $s = 2n - 1$ on the first step, $s = 2n - 3$ on the second, and so on, the expert will be able to identify the fake coin.

You can add, subtract, and multiply these functions (including squaring, cubing, ...), multiply them by any number, add any number to them, and perform these operations on the resulting expressions. Obtain the function $1/x$:\n\nProve that if any of the functions $f_{1}$, $f_{2}$, $f_{3}$ is erased from the board, it is impossible to obtain $1/x$.\n\n## Solution\n\nSince $f_{2}(x) - f_{3}(x) = 2x - 1$, and since we can add 1 and multiply the resulting expression $2x$ by $1/2$, we can obtain the function $x$. Subtracting it from $f_{1}(x)$, we get $1/x = f_{1}(x) - 1/2(f_{2}(x) - f_{3}(x) + 1)$.\n\nSince the division operation is not allowed, it is impossible to express $1/x$ using only the functions $f_{2}$ and $f_{3}$: if you multiply and add polynomials, you will get polynomials again, and the function $1/x$ is not a polynomial. The derivatives of the functions $f_{1}$ and $f_{3}$ at the point $x=1$ are 0. If the derivatives of two functions at the point 1 are 0, then the derivative of both their sum and their product is 0. So all functions that can be obtained from $f_{1}$ and $f_{3}$ using the specified operations have a zero derivative at the point 1. The derivative of the function $1/x$ at the point 1 is not 0.\n\nAll our functions are defined for all complex $x \\neq 0$. If we substitute $x=i$ into $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$, we get $i + i^{-1} = 0$, $i^2 = -1$ - real numbers. This means that each of the functions obtained from $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$ will have a real value at the point $i$.

{"item": {"input": "You are a helpful assistant. Your task is to solve the following logic and puzzle quiz:\n\nTask 3. On the ceiling of a room, there are 15 lamps, numbered from 1 to 15. Initially, all the lamps are off. In another room, there are 15 switches: one switch for lamp 1 and 2, one switch for lamp 2 and 3, one switch for lamp 3 and 4, and so on, up to a switch for lamp 15 and 1. When the switch for such a pair of lamps is flipped, the status of each of those two lamps changes (from on to off or vice versa). The switches are arranged in a random order and all look identical. Raymond wants to find out which switch corresponds to which pair of lamps. From the room with the switches, he cannot see the lamps. However, he can flip a number of switches and then go to the other room to see which lamps are on. He can do this multiple times. How many times does he need to go to the other room at a minimum to be certain which switch corresponds to which pair of lamps?", "final_answer": "4", "solution": "Solution. With three rounds of walking, Raymond can never be certain. Indeed, if for each switch you note whether it is in the initial position or the flipped position in the three rounds, then you can get $2^{3}=8$ different patterns. However, there are 15 switches, so there are multiple switches with the same pattern, and Raymond can never distinguish these switches. Therefore, he must walk at least four times. We will prove that this is indeed sufficient.\n\nAssume that Raymond, starting from the situation where all the lights are off, flips a number of switches. If he flips all the switches or none at all, then all the lights will still be off afterward. Otherwise, there will always be a light that has been changed by only one flipped switch, so it will be on. Consider such a light $i$ that is on. Then the switch with $i-1$ and $i$ or the switch with $i$ and $i+1$ has been flipped. (Consider the light numbers modulo 15.) First, assume that the latter is the case. Now consider light $i+1$. If it is off, then the switch with $i+1$ and $i+2$ has also been flipped; if it is on, then that switch has not been used. Next, we can deduce from the status of light $i+2$ whether the switch with $i+2$ and $i+3$ has been flipped or not. By continuing this process, we see that it is determined for all switches whether they have been flipped or not. In the second case, if it is precisely the switch with $i-1$ and $i$ that has been flipped, then it is also determined for all switches whether they have been flipped or not. Therefore, there are exactly two combinations of switches that result in the same status of the lights. If we choose one of these combinations and then flip all 15 switches again, the same lights will be on, so this must result in exactly the second combination of switches. If the first combination of switches contains an even number of switches, then the second combination contains 15 minus that number, so an odd number of switches.\n\nHowever, Raymond knows himself how many switches he has flipped. He can deduce from the situation of the lights which two combinations of switches are possible, and only one of these can match the number of switches he has flipped. Therefore, he can precisely determine which lights the switches he has flipped correspond to; he only does not know which is which within that group of switches.\n\nNow write the numbers 1 to 15 in binary notation. For this, a maximum of 4 digits are needed; pad with zeros if necessary so that each number is written with exactly 4 digits. Raymond numbers the switches with these binary numbers. In the first round, he flips the switches whose numbers in binary notation start with a 1 and notes the 8 corresponding light pairs. In the second round, he first resets all the switches and then chooses the numbers that have a 1 in the second position in binary notation. Similarly, in the third round, he chooses the third position in the binary notation, and in the fourth round, the fourth position. In each round, he can determine which light pairs the switches he has used correspond to (only not which is which). Since each switch corresponds to a unique combination of rounds, he can then figure out for each switch which light pair it controls. For example, if a certain light pair is turned on in the first round, not in the second round, in the third round, and also in the fourth round, then it corresponds to the switch with binary code 1011, which is switch 11. Therefore, he can succeed in four rounds of walking."}}

The face opposite to this one has $7-(7-x)=x$ dots, the face that touches this one also has $x$ dots, and finally, the face that touches this one again has $7-x$ dots (see the figure).\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_09631cee7cda5a5e8dbdg-1.jpg?height=288&width=856&top_left_y=392&top_left_x=624)\n\nIt can be observed that this last face is on the surface of the large cube and can be uniquely matched to the face of the original small cube, as it is opposite to it. Therefore, the $6 \\cdot 3^{2}=54$ small faces on the surface of the large cube can be paired such that each face is in exactly one pair, and the sum of the dots on the faces in each pair is 7. Since $\\frac{54}{2}=27$ such pairs exist, the total number of dots on the surface of the cube is $27 \\cdot 7=189$.\n\nRemark. Similarly, it can be proven that the number of dots on the surface of a $(2 n+1) \\times(2 m+1) \\times(2 k+1)$ rectangular prism with the property described in the problem is\n\n$$\n7 \\cdot[(2 n+1)(2 m+1)+(2 n+1)(2 k+1)+(2 m+1)(2 k+1)]\n$$\n\nII. solution. On the surface of a regular die, each pair of opposite faces has a total of 7 dots, and there are three pairs of faces on a die. Therefore, a single die has $3 \\cdot 7=21$ dots, and 27 dice have a total of $27 \\cdot 21=567$ dots. From this number, the number of dots on the glued faces must be subtracted.\n\nTake three cubes glued side by side. The middle cube has a total of 7 dots on its glued faces. The other two cubes have the same number of dots on their glued faces as the middle cube, which is also 7 dots. Therefore, a set of three cubes hides 14 dots.\n\nEach pair of opposite faces of the large cube defines 9 such sets of three cubes, totaling 27 sets of three cubes, so the number of hidden dots is $27 \\cdot 14=378$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of dots on the surface of the large cube is $567-378=189$."}}

Determine the number of nice sets containing the number 2008.\r\n\r\n[i]Author: Fedor Petrov[/i]", "final_answer": "8", "solution": "1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   We need to determine the number of nice sets containing the number 2008. A set \\( X \\) of positive integers is called *nice* if for each pair \\( a, b \\in X \\), exactly one of the numbers \\( a + b \\) and \\( |a - b| \\) belongs to \\( X \\).\n\n2. **Initial Observations:**\n   Let \\( a \\in X \\) be an element of \\( X \\). We need to use the definition of a nice set to derive properties of \\( X \\). Specifically, we need to determine which multiples of \\( a \\) belong to \\( X \\).\n\n3. **Inductive Argument:**\n   We will prove by induction that \\( ka \\in X \\) if and only if \\( k \\) is not divisible by 3.\n   - **Base Case:** For \\( k = 1 \\), \\( a \\in X \\) by definition.\n   - **Inductive Step:**\n     - Assume \\( ka \\in X \\) for \\( k \\) not divisible by 3.\n     - Consider \\( 2a \\). If \\( 2a \\notin X \\), then \\( |a - a| = 0 \\notin X \\), which is true since 0 is not a positive integer.\n     - Now, consider \\( 3a \\). If \\( 3a \\in X \\), then for \\( a \\in X \\), \\( |3a - a| = 2a \\in X \\), which contradicts our assumption that \\( 2a \\notin X \\). Hence, \\( 3a \\notin X \\).\n     - For \\( 4a \\), if \\( 4a \\notin X \\), then \\( |4a - a| = 3a \\notin X \\), which is consistent with our previous result. Thus, \\( 4a \\in X \\).\n\n4. **Minimal Element Argument:**\n   Let \\( x \\in X \\) be the minimal element of \\( X \\). Suppose there is some \\( l \\in X \\) which is not divisible by \\( x \\). Applying our previous considerations to the multiples of \\( x \\) and \\( l \\), we see \\( x \\) and \\( l \\) must be divisible by the same power of 3 (otherwise some multiple of \\( 3x \\) would be in \\( X \\)).\n\n5. **Contradiction Argument:**\n   Choose the minimal \\( l \\in X \\) not divisible by \\( x \\) (assuming such exists). Then both \\( |l - x| \\) and \\( |l - 2x| \\) are less than \\( l \\) and not divisible by \\( x \\), so they can't be in \\( X \\). Hence, \\( l + x \\) and \\( l + 2x \\in X \\). But one of these numbers is divisible by a higher power of 3 than \\( x \\), leading to a contradiction.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   Thus, \\( X \\) consists only of multiples of \\( kx \\) for which \\( k \\) is not divisible by 3. Since 2008 is not divisible by 3, the answer follows.\n\n7. **Counting Nice Sets:**\n   The number of nice sets containing 2008 is equal to the number of divisors of 2008 that are not divisible by 3. The prime factorization of 2008 is \\( 2^3 \\times 251 \\). The divisors of 2008 are \\( 1, 2, 4, 8, 251, 502, 1004, 2008 \\). None of these are divisible by 3.\n\nThe final answer is \\( \\boxed{8} \\)."}}

Without loss of generality, we can assume \\( g_1 < g_2 < \\cdots < g_{13} \\).\n\n2. Let \\( k \\) be the number of times Fredek says goodbye to 10 friends. Since each time he says goodbye to 10 friends, the total number of goodbyes is \\( 10k \\). Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   10k = \\sum_{i=1}^{13} g_i\n   \\]\n\n3. Since \\( g_{13} \\) is the maximum number of goodbyes received by any friend, we have \\( g_{13} \\le k \\).\n\n4. To find the minimum \\( k \\), we need to consider the sum of the smallest possible values of \\( g_i \\) given that \\( g_1 < g_2 < \\cdots < g_{13} \\) and \\( g_{13} \\le k \\). The smallest possible values for \\( g_i \\) are \\( g_{13} - 12, g_{13} - 11, \\ldots, g_{13} - 1, g_{13} \\).\n\n5.

If the series of questions started on Wednesday, then we received the answer \"Physics\" on Saturday, as well as on Monday, which is impossible since Pinocchio always lies on Saturday, and always tells the truth on Monday. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the series of questions started on Tuesday. In that case, Pinocchio gave the answer \"History\" on Tuesday.

Alex the T-rex wishes to place a positive integer in each square in such a way that:\n[list]\n[*] No two numbers are equal.\n[*] If a number $m$ is placed on square $C$, then at least $k$ of the squares orthogonally adjacent to $C$ have a multiple of $m$ written on them.\n[/list]\nWhat is the greatest value of $k$ for which this is possible?", "final_answer": " k = 2 ", "solution": "1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   We need to place positive integers on an infinite chessboard such that:\n   - No two numbers are equal.\n   - For any number \\( m \\) placed on a square \\( C \\), at least \\( k \\) of the squares orthogonally adjacent to \\( C \\) have a multiple of \\( m \\) written on them.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Constraints:**\n   - If \\( k = 4 \\), then all four orthogonally adjacent squares must have multiples of \\( m \\). This is impossible because two adjacent squares cannot both divide each other. Hence, \\( k \\neq 4 \\).\n   - If \\( k = 3 \\), consider a square with a number \\( a \\). Suppose the number \\( ka \\) is written next to it. Without loss of generality, let the number not divisible by \\( a \\) be to its left. Below \\( ka \\), there must be a multiple of it, say \\( akb \\). The square to the left of this must be a multiple of both \\( a \\) and \\( akb \\), which is not possible since it cannot divide both.\n\n3. **Constructing a Solution for \\( k = 2 \\):**\n   - We need to show that it is possible to place numbers such that each number \\( m \\) has at least 2 orthogonally adjacent squares with multiples of \\( m \\).\n   - Start by placing the numbers \\( 1, 2, 4, 8 \\) in a \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) square:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n     \\hline\n     1 & 2 \\\\\n     \\hline\n     4 & 8 \\\\\n     \\hline\n     \\end{array}\n     \\]\n   - We can extend this pattern by adding new rows or columns while maintaining the condition. For example, add a new column to the right:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\n     \\hline\n     1 & 2 & 16 \\\\\n     \\hline\n     4 & 8 & 32 \\\\\n     \\hline\n     \\end{array}\n     \\]\n     Here, \\( 16 \\) is a multiple of \\( 2 \\) and \\( 8 \\), and \\( 32 \\) is a multiple of \\( 4 \\) and \\( 8 \\).\n\n4. **Generalizing the Construction:**\n   - For any new row or column, pick the top right square and add a multiple of it to its right. Below it, take a multiple of the product of numbers on the left and top (choose multiples large enough to ensure distinctness).\n   - This ensures that each number has at least 2 orthogonally adjacent squares with multiples of it.\n\nThe final answer is \\( \\boxed{ k = 2 } \\)."}}
