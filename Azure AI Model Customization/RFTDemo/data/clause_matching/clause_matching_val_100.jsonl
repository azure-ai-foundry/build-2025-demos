The Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee shall be paid by you to us in the manner provided in Section 4.3 of this Agreement by the fifteenth(15 th ) day of each calendar month based on royalty fees generated and received during the previous calendar month.   4.2.2 You shall pay to us a franchise sales royalty fee (the \"Franchise Sales Royalty Fee\") for each Unit Franchise you sell in the Master Territory as follows: twenty-five percent (25%) of the initial franchise fee collected from each Unit Franchisee upon execution of the Unit Franchisee's Franchise Agreement (a \"Unit Franchise Agreement\"); provided, however, that if you elect to discount or reduce an initial franchise fee for any reason, the Franchise Sales Royalty Fee shall be payable to us as if the full initial franchise fee had been paid. The Franchise Sales Royalty Fee shall be paid by you to us at the same time and in the same manner as the Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee provided in Section 4.2.1 above. Any Royalty Fee you collect from the Franchisee shall be immediately paid to Us, but no later than the fifteen (15  th ) day of each calendar month. A Unit Franchise shall be deemed to be sold to a Unit Franchisee on the date that you and the Unit Franchisee execute the Unit Franchise Agreement, irrespective of when the Unit Franchise begins operation. Fees and Royalties cannot be increased or decreased without our prior written consent.\n\n4\n\nSource: SOUPMAN, INC., 8-K, 8/14/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  4.2.3 In addition to the Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee and Franchise Sales Royalty Fee described above, you shall collect from each Unit Franchisee in your Master Territory a \"National Advertising Fund Contribution\" to be contributed to our \"National Advertising Fund\" pursuant to the terms of the individual Unit Franchise Agreements. For each Unit Franchise you own and operate, you shall pay the National Advertising Fund Contribution on the same basis as Unit Franchisees. The National Advertising Fund Contribution shall be collected by you from each Unit Franchisee and spent by you in accordance with the agreement on behalf of the franchisor and Franchisees.   4.3 Manner of Payment   You shall pay us all Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fees and Franchise Sales Royalty Fees, due under this Section 4 by electronic funds transfer by us against a bank account maintained by you. You agree to execute the documents required by us, our bank and/or your bank in order to permit us to conduct electronic funds transfers to and from your account, and you shall not close your account without our prior consent. Your failure to comply with the terms of this Section 4.3 shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement. You hereby authorize us to initiate debit entries and/or credit collection entries to your bank account for the payment of Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fees, Franchise Sales Royalty Fees, National Advertising Fund Contributions, and all other sums that may become due to us or our affiliates from you. You shall make funds available for withdrawal by us by electronic transfer on such dates of each month as we shall designate throughout the term of this Agreement.   If you fail to provide the revenue reports described in Section 4.6 below, then in addition to the late fee described in such Section, we may debit your account for one hundred forty percent (140%) of the last Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee, Franchise Sales Royalty Fee and/or National Advertising Fund Contribution (as applicable) that we debited. If the Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee, Franchise Sales Royalty Fee and/or National Advertising Fund Contribution we debit are less than the fees you actually owe us, once we have been able to determine the true and correct revenue amounts, we will debit your account for the balance on a day we specify. If the Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee, Franchise Sales Royalty Fee and/or National Advertising Fund Contribution we debit are greater than the fees you actually owe us, we will credit the excess against the amount we otherwise would debit from your account for the next payment due.   4.4 Interest on Overdue Amounts   Any payment not actually received by us on or before the Fifteen (15 th ) day of each month (or the next business day if the Fifteen(15 th ) of any month is not a business day) shall be deemed overdue and you shall pay to us, in addition to the overdue payment, interest on such overdue amount at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is less. Interest shall accrue from the original due date until payment is received in full. Our right to such interest shall be in addition to any other remedies we may have, including, without limitation, the right of set-off to withdraw or retain, from time to time and without notice to you, any amounts due and unpaid by us to you. You shall not be entitled to set-off any payments required to be made under this Section 4 against any monetary claim you may have against us.\n\n5\n\nSource: SOUPMAN, INC., 8-K, 8/14/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  4.5 Late Fee; Insufficient Funds Fee   In the event you fail to provide us with any report we require on or before the date we require it, you agree to pay to us a late fee in the amount of Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250). In addition, if, for any reason, any payment owed by you to us is denied by your bank due to insufficient funds in your account, then you shall, in addition to applicable interest as described in Section 4.4 above, pay us an insufficient funds fee in the amount of Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250). If you incur three (3) late fees or insufficient funds fees within any twelve (12) month period, we will have the right to terminate this Agreement without providing you an opportunity to cure the default.   4.6 Unit Franchise Agreements and Revenue Reports   You shall submit to us copies of all Unit Franchise Agreements executed with Unit Franchisees within ten (10) days of the date of their execution, together with a copy of all checks presented to you at closing. You shall prepare and submit to us a monthly report, not later than the first (1 s t ) day of each month, of Franchise Sales Revenue generated by you during the previous calendar month. Contemporaneously with the submission of the Franchise Sales Revenue report, you shall prepare and submit to us a monthly report, in such form and including such detail as we require, reflecting royalty fees paid and owed to you by your Unit Franchisees for the previous calendar month. Any report not actually received by us when due shall be deemed overdue and you shall pay us a late charge as described above.   4.7 Security Interest   In order to secure payment of all Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fees, Franchise Sales Royalty Fees, National Advertising Fund Contributions, and all other sums that may become due to us or our affiliates from you under this Agreement, and to secure your performance of all obligations of any kind, whenever and however incurred, in favor of us or our affiliates:   4.7.1 You hereby grant us a security interest in and to all equipment, furniture, fixtures, inventory, supplies and vehicles used in connection with the Franchised Business, now or hereafter acquired by you, together with all accounts, payment intangibles, attachments, accessories, additions, substitutions and replacements, all cash and non-cash proceeds derived from insurance or the disposition of such assets, all of your rights to use the Proprietary Marks, patents, copyrights and their registrations, trade secret information and other proprietary rights, and all rights granted, owned or licensed to you under this Agreement for the use of the Proprietary Marks, trade names, trade styles, patents, copyrights, trade secret information and other proprietary rights. You hereby authorize us to prepare and file all Uniform Commercial Code (\"UCC\") financing statements and other documents necessary or desirable to evidence, perfect and continue the priority of this security interest under the UCC.   4.7.2 If you are and remain in good standing under this Agreement and all other agreements with us and our affiliates, we will consent to your grant of an additional security interest in the Franchised Business or in any of the assets of the Franchised Business if the conditions set forth in Section 12.4 of this Agreement are met.   4.7.3 If you are in default of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement or any other agreements between us and our affiliates and you, we may, in our sole and absolute discretion, exercise our rights with respect to our security interest. In such event, you shall be and remain liable for any deficiency remaining due to us and shall be entitled to recover any surplus which results after application of the proceeds derived from the enforcement of our security interest.\n\n6\n\nSource: SOUPMAN, INC., 8-K, 8/14/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  4.8 Reimbursement of Monies   You shall pay to us, within fifteen (15) days of any written request by us accompanied by reasonable substantiating material, any monies which we have paid, or have become obligated to pay, on your behalf by consent or otherwise under this Agreement.   4.9 Application of Fees   Notwithstanding any designation by you, we shall have the sole discretion to apply any payments made by you to any past due indebtedness of yours for Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fees, Franchise Sales Royalty Fees, National Advertising Fund Contributions, or any other indebtedness, in such amounts and in such order as we shall determine.   5. YOUR OBLIGATIONS   You understand and acknowledge that every detail of the System is essential to you and us in order to develop and maintain quality operating standards, to increase the demand for the products and services sold by all master franchisees operating under the System and to protect the Proprietary Marks and our reputation and goodwill. You shall comply with our standards with respect to services, products and operations and shall operate the Franchised Business in strict conformity with such methods, standards, and specifications as we may from time to time prescribe in the Manuals or otherwise. You shall refrain from deviating from such standards, specifications and procedures without our prior written consent and from otherwise operating in any manner which reflects adversely on the Proprietary Marks or the System. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you agree that:   (a) You shall only use and serve soups that are approved by us and must be purchased from suppliers designated or approved in writing by us and you acknowledge that all soups approved shall not be those of Al Yeganeh. We will use our best efforts to have all soups produced to Al Yeganeh's standards.

OBLIGATIONS UPON TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION   Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, all rights granted under this Agreement to you shall forthwith terminate and:   11.1 Cessation of Business   You shall immediately cease to operate the Franchised Business, and shall not thereafter, directly or indirectly, represent to the public or hold yourself out as a present or former master franchisee of ours.   11.2 Cessation of Use of Confidential Information and Proprietary Marks   You shall immediately and permanently cease to use, by advertising or in any other manner whatsoever, any confidential methods, procedures, and techniques associated with the System, and all Proprietary Marks and distinctive forms, slogans, signs, symbols, and devices associated with the System.   11.3 Cancellation of Assumed Name Registration   You shall take such action as may be necessary to cancel any assumed name registration or equivalent registration obtained by you which contains the Proprietary Marks; and you shall furnish us with evidence satisfactory to us of compliance with this obligation within thirty (30) days after termination or expiration of this Agreement.   11.4 Payment of Monies Due; Liquidated Damages   11.4.1 You shall promptly pay all sums owing to us and our affiliates. In the event of termination for any default of yours, such sums shall include all damages, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by us as a result of the default, which obligation shall give rise to and remain, until paid in full, a lien in our favor against any and all leasehold improvements, fixtures, furnishings and equipment, inventory, supplies and vehicles located at or used in connection with the Franchised Business, together with all accounts, payment intangibles, attachments, accessories, additions, substitutions and replacements, all cash and non-cash proceeds derived from insurance or the disposition of such assets, all your rights to use the Proprietary Marks, patents, copyrights and their registrations, trade secret information and other proprietary rights, and all rights granted, owned or licensed to you under this Agreement for the use of the Proprietary Marks, trade names, trade styles, patents, copyrights, trade secret information and other proprietary rights.

The parties hereto consider this liquidated damages provision to be a reasonable, good faith pre-estimate of those damages.   11.4.4 The liquidated damages provision only covers our damages from the loss of cash flow from the Royalty Fees. It does not cover any other damages, including damages to our reputation with the public and landlords and damages arising from a violation of any provision of this Agreement other than the Royalty Fee sections. You and each of your principals agree that the liquidated damages provision does not give us an adequate remedy at law for any default under, or for the enforcement of, any provision of this Agreement other than the Royalty Fee sections.\n\n26\n\nSource: SOUPMAN, INC., 8-K, 8/14/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  11.5 Costs to Secure Compliance   You shall pay to us all damages, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by us prior or subsequent to the termination or expiration of the franchise herein granted in obtaining injunctive or other relief for the enforcement of any provisions of this Section 11.   11.6 Return of Manuals and Other Confidential Information   You shall immediately deliver to us the Manuals and all other records, correspondence, files, and any instructions containing confidential information relating to the operation of the Franchised Business which are in your possession, and all copies thereof, all of which are acknowledged to be our property.   11.7 Irreparable Injury to Us   You agree and acknowledge that your failure to comply with the provisions of this Section 11 will result in irreparable harm to us and to the Proprietary Marks, and you agree to pay all damages, expenses, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by us in obtaining specific performance of, or an injunction against violation of, and/or damages resulting from a violation of, the requirements of this Section 11.   11.8 Compliance with Post-Term Covenants   All of your covenants, obligations, and agreements which by their terms or by reasonable implication are to be performed, in whole or in part, after the termination or expiration of this Agreement, shall survive such termination or expiration.   12.

Our consent or refusal to consent may be based upon whatever factors we, in our sole discretion, deem economically and commercially reasonable in protecting our interests and security interest under this Agreement and the relationship created under this Agreement; however, if you are in good standing under this Agreement and all other agreements between us or our affiliates and you, we shall, upon your written request, execute a written subordination of our security interest to lenders and/or lessors providing financing for the Franchised Business. Under any circumstances however, we shall not consent to any such granting of a security interest unless all of the following conditions are met:   12.3.1 Such security is granted only for the purpose of securing a loan in your favor, which loan shall only be for the benefit of the Franchised Business.   12.3.2 In the event of any default by you under any documents in any way relating to the security interest or the loan to which it relates, we shall have the right at our sole option (but not the obligation) to cure any such default and/or to be substituted as obligor to the lender whose interests are secured by such security interest.   12.3.3 In the event of any such default, and if we choose to be substituted as obligor, we shall be so substituted in all respects on the same terms and conditions to which you were subject, except that any acceleration of the obligations secured, due to your default, shall be void upon cure by us.   12.3.4 Such other conditions and terms as we shall deem necessary and/or prudent to protect our interests under this Agreement.   12.4 Transfer Upon Death or Disability   Upon the death or permanent disability (mental or physical) of any person with an interest in this Agreement, in you, or in all or substantially all of the assets of the Franchised Business, the executor, administrator, or personal representative of such person shall transfer such interest to a third party approved by us within twelve (12) months after such death or disability. Such transfers, including, without limitation, transfers by devise or inheritance, shall be subject to the same conditions as any inter vivos transfer, except that the transfer fee shall be waived. In the case of transfer by devise or inheritance, however, if the heirs or beneficiaries of any such person are unable to meet the conditions of this Section 12, the executor, administrator, or personal representative of the decedent shall transfer the decedent's interest to another party approved by us within twelve (12) months, which disposition shall be subject to all the terms and conditions for transfers contained in this Agreement. We may, at our option, assume management and control of the Franchised Business during such twelve (12) month period and shall be paid a reasonable monthly management fee for our services as determined by us. If the interest is not disposed of within such period, we may, at our option, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.2.4 of this Agreement.\n\n28\n\nSource: SOUPMAN, INC., 8-K, 8/14/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  12.5 Non-Waiver of Claims   Our consent to a transfer shall not constitute a waiver of any claims we may have against the transferring party, nor shall it be deemed a waiver of our right to demand exact compliance with any of the terms of this Agreement by the transferor or transferee.   12.6 Transfer by You in Bankruptcy - Right of First Refusal   If, for any reason, this Agreement is not terminated pursuant to Section 10.1 and this Agreement is assumed, or assignment of the same to any person or entity who has made a bona fide offer to accept an assignment of this Agreement is contemplated pursuant to the United States Bankruptcy Code, then notice of such proposed assignment or assumption setting forth: (a) the name and address of the proposed assignee, and (b) all of the terms and conditions of the proposed assignment and assumption shall be given to us within twenty (20) days after receipt of such proposed assignee's offer to accept assignment of this Agreement, and, in any event, within ten (10) days prior to the date application is made to a court of competent jurisdiction for authority and approval to enter into such assignment and assumption, and we shall thereupon have the prior right and option, to be exercised by notice given at any time prior to the effective date of such proposed assignment and assumption, to accept an assignment of this Agreement to us upon the same terms and conditions and for the same consideration, if any, as in the bona fide offer made by the proposed assignee, less any brokerage commissions which may be payable by you out of the consideration to be paid by such assignee for the assignment of this Agreement.   13.

You shall include in the standard Unit Franchise Agreement used by you a provision which states that we are a third-party beneficiary to the Unit Franchise Agreement and are entitled to the rights granted in this Section 13.

Your failure to exercise the proper diligence in enforcing the terms of any Unit Franchise Agreement and to insure the appropriate monitoring and use of the Proprietary Marks shall constitute a default under the terms of this Agreement which may result in termination of this Agreement.   13.4 Effect of Termination of this Agreement   In the event this Agreement is terminated or expires prior to the end of the term of this Agreement, those portions of this Agreement which pertain to and apply to any Unit Franchise Agreement will continue in full force and effect, but only with regard to those Unit Franchise Agreements which have been entered into and were in effect prior to the date of termination or expiration of this Agreement.   13.5 Unit Franchise Refund Policy   You shall comply with our requirements related to a Unit Franchisee's right to terminate its Unit Franchise Agreement according to the terms of such Unit Franchise Agreement, if any, as well as our policy regarding refunds of initial franchise fees to Unit Franchisees, if any.   14.

For the purpose of this Section 14.4, the term \"losses and expenses\" shall be deemed to include compensatory, exemplary, or punitive damages; fines and penalties; attorneys' fees; experts' fees; court costs; costs associated with investigating and defending against claims; settlement amounts; judgments; compensation for damages to our reputation and goodwill; and all other costs associated with any of the foregoing losses and expenses.

Any assumption of ours shall not modify your indemnification obligation. We may, in our sole judgment, take such actions as we deem necessary and appropriate to investigate, defend, or settle any event or take other remedial or corrective actions with respect thereto as may be, in our sole judgment, necessary for the protection of the Indemnitees or the System. You shall defend us and each of our affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, agents, and employees named in any lawsuit based on such loss or expenses and shall pay all costs and reasonable attorneys' fees associated with such defense. If we wish to retain our own counsel to defend any such action, you shall reimburse us for all reasonable costs and legal fees incurred by us for such defense. Said reimbursement shall be made to us in a timely manner upon demand as such fees are incurred by us and billed to you.\n\n31\n\nSource: SOUPMAN, INC., 8-K, 8/14/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  15.

You acknowledge that you are entering into this Agreement, and any ancillary agreements executed contemporaneously herewith, as a result of your own independent investigation of the business franchised hereby and not as a result of any representation made by us or persons associated with us, or other franchisees, which are contrary to the terms herein set forth or which are contrary to the terms of any Franchise Disclosure Document or other similar document required or permitted to be given to you pursuant to applicable law. Except for those permitted under this Agreement to be made unilaterally by us, no amendment, change, or variation from this Agreement shall be binding on either party unless mutually agreed to by the parties and executed by their authorized officers or agents in writing.

The parties wish to produce a series of recorded compilations and companion song books featuring praise and worship repertoires, which will be co-branded and co-marketed throughout the world. Now, therefore, the parties agree as follows:\n\n1.       Product Concept and Creation.\n\n      a.       Product description. The product to be created under the                   series trade name \"Songs 4 Worship\" will be a praise and                   worship continuity series, with each volume in the series                   containing approximately 22 songs. Each volume will be                   manufactured in Double CD, Double Cassette, and song book                   formats, with standard double jewel boxes, inlays, booklets                   and j-cards (the \"Product\"). TL and Integrity will jointly                   develop the repertoire, and all repertoire selections are                   subject to master, mechanical and print rights clearance in                   accordance with the financial terms established below. The                   exact songbook format, song selection and number of songbook                   volumes has not yet been determined, and TL has no obligation                   to sell any songbooks produced pursuant to this Agreement.\n\n      b.       Branding. The Product will prominently display the \"Songs 4                   Worship\" logo and trademark (or other logo as mutually                   approved) and will also bear the labels of \"Time Life Music\"                   and \"Integrity Music\" in equal proportion on the exterior of                   Product packaging. The \"Integrity Music\" and \"Time Life Music\"                   logos will be used on advertising whenever possible, and it is                   understood that neither logo will be used without the other                   with reference to the Product.\n\n      c.       Integrity's responsibilities. Integrity will obtain master                   lease and print agreements with all third party owners of                   masters embodied in the Product at its own expense. Mechanical                   rates will not exceed [**]/1/ percent ([**]/1/%) of the                   then-current statutory rate, and Print licenses will not                   exceed a prorated portion of [**]/1/ percent ([**]/1/%) of the                   retail selling price, Integrity will also manufacture the                   Product and sell to TL its requirements for resale.\n\n--------------- /1/ Indicates information which has been redacted pursuant to a request for     confidential treatment.\n\n4\n\nSource: INTEGRITY MEDIA INC, 10-K405, 3/29/2001\n\n\n\n\n\n      d.

(Integrity agrees to respond to any request for                   approval within five (5) business days after Integrity's                   receipt of request and samples.) In addition, TL will pay all                   mastering expense required in preparation for manufacturing.\n\n      e.       Shared expenses. The parties agree to share equally in costs                   of additional products created (excluding the Product, and                   song books, which such song books shall be created at                   Integrity's sole discretion and expense), by mutual agreement                   under the \"Songs 4 Worship\" branding.\n\n2.

Now, therefore, the parties agree as follows:\n\n1.       Product Concept and Creation.\n\n      a.       Product description. The product to be created under the                   series trade name \"Songs 4 Worship\" will be a praise and                   worship continuity series, with each volume in the series                   containing approximately 22 songs.

Each party hereto agrees to indemnify the other party          and save and hold the other harmless from any and all claims, causes of          action, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses (including          legal costs and attorneys' fees) arising out of or connected with any          claim, demand or action which is inconsistent with any of the          warranties, representations, covenants or agreements which the          indemnifying party has made in this Agreement. Pending the          determination and settlement of any such claim, demand or action, the          non-indemnifying party will have the right, at its election, to          withhold payment to you of any monies otherwise payable hereunder, in          an amount reasonably related to that claim, demand or action, and its          estimated costs and expenses (including legal costs and attorneys'          fees) in connection therewith.\n\n11.

STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT Effective Date: April 17, 2017   THIS STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AGREEMENT (this \"Agreement\"), is entered into by and between Lion Biotechnologies, Inc., with a place of business located at 999 Skyway Road, Suite 150, San Carlos, CA 94070 (\"LBIO\"), and The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, with a place of business located at 1515 Holcombe Blvd., Houston, TX 77030 (\"MD Anderson\"), a member institution of The University of Texas System (\"System\"), as of the date set forth above (the \"Effective Date\"). MD Anderson and LBIO are hereinafter individually referred to as a \"Party\" and are collectively known as the \"Parties\".   WHEREAS, as a comprehensive cancer research, treatment, and educational center, MD Anderson undertakes research and experimental activities in a variety of disciplines; and   WHEREAS, the Parties hereby wish to establish a collaboration (\"Collaboration\") with respect to the performance of one or more research studies to be conducted pursuant to this Agreement (each such study, a \"Study\", and collectively the \"Studies\", and the activities to be performed with respect to the Studies collectively, the \"Research\").   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, LBIO and MD Anderson hereby agree to be legally bound as follows:   1. Governance.   1.1 Joint Steering Committee. The Parties will establish a joint steering committee (\"JSC\") of equal representation, comprised of three members from each Party, with the members of each Party collectively having one vote on all matters to be decided upon by the JSC. Each Party can appoint and replace its members in the JSC at its own discretion through timely written notice to the other Party. The Principal Investigators for each Study (as defined hereinafter) shall attend each JSC meeting, except in the event of exigent circumstances that do not permit such attendance.   1.2 JSC Meetings. The JSC will have meetings (either in person, by teleconference or via electronic means) at least quarterly. At least one meeting per year will be conducted in person or by videoconference (including the kick-off meeting), with the location alternating between a site a selected by LBIO and a site selected by MD Anderson. LBIO will choose the location of the first such in-person meeting. Subject to Section 1.4 below, the JSC will decide on matters by unanimous vote; provided, however, that no action may lawfully be taken at any meeting unless at least two members from each Party (including for this purpose any proxy member appointed as provided below) are present at the meeting. If a member of the JSC is unable to attend a meeting, he or she may appoint, in writing, a proxy to participate and vote in his or her stead.\n\n 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  1.3 JSC Responsibilities. The main task of the JSC will be to oversee the Collaboration. In order to achieve the objectives of the Collaboration, the JSC will oversee each Study under the Collaboration. The JSC will provide technical, scientific, clinical, and regulatory guidance regarding the Studies and will be responsible for monitoring progress of the Studies. In addition, the JSC will be responsible for coordinating resolution of problems arising in the Studies or in the Collaboration as a whole. Additional members can be invited by the JSC on a case by case basis should discussion of certain topics require so; provided, that such members will be subject to obligations of confidentiality and non-use at least as strict as those set forth in Section 5 below.   1.4 Dispute Resolution. Decisions regarding Study design, changes and/or additions to the initially-agreed Protocols must be unanimous, with each Party exercising one vote each, and in the absence of such unanimity the status quo shall be maintained. For all other matters before the JSC, a unanimous decision, with each Party exercising one vote, is required; provided, that, if unanimity cannot be achieved regarding such other matters, then LBIO's chief executive officer may make the decision on behalf of the JSC, provided that LBIO's chief executive officer will first make a good faith effort to consult with a designated executive at MD Anderson to resolve such matter.   2. Performance of Studies.   2.1 Studies.   (a) During the Term (as defined below), LBIO and MD Anderson may periodically agree to collaborate with respect to the performance of one or more Studies. In connection with each Study, the Parties shall execute, as applicable, a Study-specific clinical trial agreement or a pre-clinical work order where a clinical trial is not being conducted (each, a \"Study Order\"). Study Orders shall be numbered sequentially and, when executed, appended to this Agreement and made a part hereof. The first three Study Orders, when completed, will be incorporated into this Agreement as Exhibit I, Exhibit II, and Exhibit III, and the Studies that are the subject of such Study Orders are also referred to herein as the \"Initial Studies\". Each Study Order shall detail the specifics of the Study to be performed under such Study Order including (i) a detailed Study-specific protocol (\"Protocol\") that will be developed jointly by the Parties working together in good faith and (ii) any Study-specific resources or support to be provided by LBIO, including any financial consideration (\"Collaboration Funding\", but excluding financial support associated with the Initial Studies to the extent addressed in Section 4 of this Agreement). Any revisions or amendments to a Study Order or Protocol shall be implemented, if at all, solely in accordance with the terms of the relevant Study Order and shall be subject to the approval of the JSC. The Parties acknowledge and agree that MD Anderson will be the \"sponsor\" of the Initial Studies that are clinical studies, as defined at 21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 50.3(f) and 312.3(b), and will be the holder of the investigational new drug applications (INDs) submitted to the FDA (as defined hereinafter) for such Initial Studies.   (b) In the event of any conflict of any terms of this Agreement and the terms of a Study Order, the terms of this Agreement shall govern, unless the Study Order specifically and expressly supersedes this Agreement with respect to a specific term, and then only with respect to the particular Study Order and specific term. If there is any discrepancy or conflict between the terms contained in a Protocol and this Agreement and/or the relevant Study Order, the terms of the Protocol shall govern and control with respect to clinical matters and the terms of this Agreement and/or the relevant Study Order shall govern and control with respect to all other matters (e.g., legal and financial matters).\n\n 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  2.2 Investigators.   (a) Principal Investigator. Each Study Order will identify the individual that will serve as the \"Principal Investigator\" for the relevant Study at MD Anderson and shall be responsible for MD Anderson's administration and supervision of its portion of such Study. If the originally named Principal Investigator becomes unable or unwilling to continue a Study for any reason, MD Anderson shall propose a substitute Principal Investigator with comparable qualifications within two business days of MD Anderson becoming aware of such event. If the proposed candidate is not available or is not acceptable to LBIO, LBIO may terminate the applicable Study in accordance with Section 8.3(ii).   (b) MD Anderson and Principal Investigator may appoint one or more collaborating physicians (\"Sub-Investigators\") to participate in a Study. Such Sub-Investigators shall work under the supervision of, shall report to and be the sole responsibility of Principal Investigator, and Principal Investigator and MD Anderson shall each ensure that all Sub-Investigators undertake all activity related to the Study in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the applicable Study Order, and the Protocol.   (c) On a Study Order-by-Study Order basis, in the event that a Principal Investigator leaves or is removed from MD Anderson (or is otherwise unwilling or unavailable to direct the applicable Study in accordance with this Agreement and the applicable Study Order), then MD Anderson shall, as soon as practicable but in any event within two (2) business days of such event, provide written notice of such event to LBIO. Any subsequently appointed principal investigator must be approved, in writing in advance, by LBIO and such new principal investigator shall be required to agree to all the terms and conditions of the applicable Study Order and this Agreement and to sign each such document as evidence of such agreement (although failure to so sign will not relieve such new principal investigator from abiding with all the terms and conditions of the applicable Study Order and this Agreement). If LBIO does not approve of the new principal investigator, or the new principal investigator does not sign this Agreement, then LBIO may terminate the applicable Study Order in accordance with Section 8.3(ii).   2.3 Performance; Compliance with Law.   (a) MD Anderson shall, and shall cause each of its employees, agents, contractors, and subcontractors performing Research activities or other obligations under this Agreement, including the Principal Investigator (collectively, \"Representatives\") to, conduct such activities, and use, store and handle all materials used in the performance of activities under this Agreement and each Study Order, or cause the same to be done, in accordance with (i) all applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines, including, to the extent applicable, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\"FFCDA\"); the anti-kickback and related provisions of the Social Security Act; the Public Health Services Act; the regulations promulgated by the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"), including 21 C.F.R. Parts 50, 56, and 58, and, with respect to clinical Studies, the requirements of the Statement of Investigator, FDA Form 1572 (as described in 21 312.53), the terms of which are incorporated by reference into any Study Order pertaining to a clinical Study (and the Principal Investigator for any such clinical Study shall complete, sign, and deliver a Form 1572 to LBIO prior to the commencement of such Study); the United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the HITECH Act, including the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information; the EU Data Protection Directive; and all other applicable privacy, security and data protection laws (collectively, this sub-clause (i), \"Laws\"), and, as applicable, the quality standards of \"Good Clinical Practice\" (which term shall mean generally accepted good clinical practices including those set out in the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice in force from time to time and FDA's most recent guidance and regulations concerning current Good Clinical Practice), (ii) the provisions of this Agreement (including each applicable Study Order and Protocol), and (iii) all written instruction from LBIO, as well as MD Anderson's internal policies and procedures to the extent they do not conflict with the foregoing subsections (i) and (ii).\n\n 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (b) LBIO is a United States corporation subject to the provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\"). Under the FCPA it is unlawful to pay or to offer to pay anything of value, directly or indirectly, to foreign government officials, government employees, political candidates, or political parties, or to persons or entities who will offer or give such payments to any of the foregoing, in order to obtain or retain business or to secure an improper commercial advantage for LBIO. MD Anderson shall not, and MD Anderson shall ensure that its Representatives do not, take or permit any action, including paying or transferring anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any official or other person to influence any decision to obtain or retain business or gain an advantage in the conduct of business, or to induce such official or other person to perform a function in violation of any Laws, that will either constitute a violation under, or cause LBIO to be in violation of, the provisions of the FCPA or applicable local bribery and corruption Laws.   (c) MD Anderson shall register each Study that is a clinical study with the relevant governmental authorities and government websites (including http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) and make all updates as required under the Laws, and shall identify LBIO as a financial collaborator (e.g., a \"Collaborator\" for the purposes of www.clinicaltrials.gov) in such registrations.   (d) To the extent required by Law, MD Anderson and Principal Investigator shall be responsible for ensuring that the Research and all applicable documents, including any Protocol and informed consent and authorization forms are properly approved by applicable regulatory authorities and an Institutional Review Board (\"IRB\"). As may be required by Law, and with respect to any given applicable Study hereunder, MD Anderson and Principal Investigator shall further be responsible for making all reports and obtaining the continuing approval from the applicable IRB. Prior to making any submission to an IRB with respect to any given applicable Study hereunder (including a Protocol, and information to be provided to potential Study subjects including the informed consent and HIPAA authorization, and as applicable, the Case Report Forms (\"CRFs\") or supporting source documentation), MD Anderson shall provide the proposed submission to LBIO for LBIO's review and approval. MD Anderson shall promptly further provide LBIO with documentation of the IRB's initial and continuing review and approval with respect to any given applicable Study hereunder, as well as any other communications and/or interactions with the IRB (summaries in the case of oral interactions and/or communications) that is related to or which may impact the Research, prior to the commencement of the Research and promptly thereafter. In the event MD Anderson's IRB requires changes in any Protocol, informed consent or related forms for a Study after the Effective Date of the applicable Study Order, LBIO shall be advised in advance and all such modifications must be approved in advance and in writing by the JSC under this Agreement. MD Anderson and Principal Investigator shall not modify a Study described in a Protocol without the prior written approval of the JSC.\n\n 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (e) MD Anderson and/or Principal Investigator shall be responsible for reporting and tracking of all adverse events with respect to a Study (\"AEs\") in compliance with all Laws and each applicable Protocol and Principal Investigator shall be responsible for updating all AEs, including any expedited safety reports. MD Anderson and LBIO will share information with each other of any findings that may impact the safety of a Study Drug including as Study Drug safety may adversely affect the health and safety of any Study subject, influence the conduct of a Study, alter an IRB's approval to continue a Study, or affect the willingness of a Study subject to continue participation in the Study. Principal Investigator and MD Anderson shall notify LBIO within twenty-four (24) hours after learning of any serious AE and any special situation report (both as defined in the applicable Protocol) incurred during or as the result of the Study, and provide a written confirmation report of such individual serious adverse event and special situation report promptly thereafter, as well as a monthly listing of all such serious adverse events and special situation reports, by electronic mail to: lionbiosafety@lionbio.com.

Without limiting Section 3.3, MD Anderson shall further handle, transport, use and store Patient Materials exclusively at the Facility(ies) or otherwise in accordance with this Agreement, unless otherwise requested by LBIO in writing, and at all times strictly in accordance with (a) MD Anderson's standards of security and confidentiality and (b) all applicable privacy, security and data protection Laws (including the United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the HITECH Act, including the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, and the EU Data Protection Directive).\n\n 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  4. Certain Financial Matters.   4.1 Initial Funding. LBIO agrees to commit funding in an amount not to exceed $14,211,864.00 for the performance of the Studies during the Term (collectively, \"Initial Funding\"), with the Initial Funding specifically allocated as follows: (a) $[* * *] for an upfront payment, and a minimum of $[* * *] for enrollment and treatment of a minimum of 40 patients in the Study described in Exhibit I (i.e., the Minimum Enrollment Target as defined in Exhibit 1) or up to $[* * *] (an \"Individual Study Budget\") for enrollment and treatment of up to 60 patients in the Study described in Exhibit I (i.e., the Maximum Enrollment Target as defined in Exhibit 1); (b) $[* * *] (which shall also be considered an Individual Study Budget) for enrollment, manufacturing of product, and treatment of 30 patients in the Study described in Exhibit II; and (c) $[* * *] for the Study described in Exhibit III. LBIO shall pay the Initial Funding in accordance with Section 4.3. For clarity, the Initial Funding is Collaboration Funding. MD Anderson agrees that all costs of this Collaboration, with the sole exceptions of any costs to supply clinical-grade aldesleukin and 4-1BB agonist for use in the expansion of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (\"TILs\"), and in the case of aldesleukin, for use in the treatment of patients, are included in the Initial Funding. Subject to the foregoing exceptions, MD Anderson shall be solely responsible for any costs it incurs in performing the Studies that are in excess of the Initial Funding.   4.2 Collaboration Funding Generally. MD Anderson shall use the Collaboration Funding solely to conduct the applicable Study and MD Anderson shall be responsible for managing cash flow between payments. It is understood and agreed that the Collaboration Funding shall cover all administrative, IRB review, patient recruitment, and all other fees, costs and expenses of MD Anderson and any of its Representatives for the conduct of the Studies or the provision of equipment or services to facilitate the Studies, and that no other form of compensation shall be paid to MD Anderson in connection with the Studies except as otherwise may be specifically and mutually agreed upon by the Parties in writing.   4.3 Payments. LBIO shall pay the Initial Funding to MD Anderson as follows. An upfront payment of $[* * *] (the \"Upfront Payment\") shall be invoiced by MDACC on the Effective Date. The remainder of the Initial Funding shall be paid as follows:   (a) In the event that the Study Order covers the performance of a clinical trial, funding shall be invoiced based on Study patient enrollment as follows, based on the Maximum Enrollment Target as defined in each Study Order:\n\nMilestone (on Study Order-by-Study Order basis)\n\n Payment (% of the Individual Study  Budget) to be provided in  connection with such Study Order* Enrollment of [* * *]% of the target patient enrollment as set forth in the applicable Protocol  [* * *]%\n\nEnrollment of [* * *]% of the target patient enrollment as set forth in the applicable Protocol  [* * *]%\n\nEnrollment of [* * *]% of the target patient enrollment as set forth in the applicable Protocol  [* * *]%\n\nEnrollment of final patient as set forth in the applicable Protocol  [* * *]% Receipt by LBIO of both (a) the final clinical study report and (b) all raw clinical data (anonymized and without including any identifying information)\n\n [* * *]%\n\n  *With respect to Exhibit 1, the Individual Study Budget shall be the one associated with the Minimum Enrollment Target (as defined in Exhibit 1), and in the event that the Parties move to the Maximum Enrollment Target (as defined in Exhibit 1) then this table shall be applied to the incremental additional patients as if the incremental additional patients constitute their own protocol/budget. For example, if LBIO decides to add ten (10) additional patients to the clinical study in Exhibit 1, each patient will be accrued at $[* * *] per patient, and LBIO will be invoiced for percentage enrollment of these ten (10) patients based on the table above.\n\n 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (b) In the event that the Study Order covers activities other than the performance of a clinical trial, a payment schedule will be set forth in the relevant Study Order.   (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, LBIO may suspend payment if, in LBIO's reasonable opinion after review of the Reports (as defined below), MD Anderson has not been performing the Research diligently and in the manner agreed upon herein.   (d) Upon the occurrence of one of the milestones identified in the table in Section 4.3(a), or described in an applicable Study Order for a non-clinical Study according to Section 4.3(b), MD Anderson shall invoice LBIO for the related payment amount. In each case, invoices shall be itemized, including by reference to Study Order title, and otherwise shall include such supporting documentation as LBIO may reasonably request. LBIO shall pay all undisputed invoices within thirty (30) days of receipt of such invoice.   (e) If the Study described in Exhibit II is not commenced, the portion of the Upfront Payment that would have been applied to that Study ($[* * *]) will be credited by MD Anderson towards the Studies described in Exhibit I and Exhibit III.   (f) All terms and payments of compensation, benefits, and any other conditions of engagement, including payment of taxes, for any person working with Principal Investigator and any other support staff who may be used in the performance of a Study (including any Sub- Investigator) shall be solely a matter between MD Anderson and such individuals.

If Metavante terminates any Service pursuant to this paragraph, Metavante agrees to assist Customer, without additional charge, in identifying an alternate provider of such terminated Service, and the Customer shall not be assessed a Termination Fee for such terminated service.\n\n7.3. Partial Termination by Customer. Except as may be provided in any Schedule, Customer agrees that, during the Term, Metavante shall be Customer's sole and exclusive provider of all Services included in Metavante's Integrated Banking Solution (deposit and loan processing services provided by Metavante as of the Commencement Date). If Customer breaches the foregoing covenant, the same shall constitute a partial termination of this Agreement, and Customer shall pay Metavante the Termination Fee for the affected Service, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty.\n\n8. TERMINATION/DEFAULT\n\n8.1. Early Termination. The terms and conditions set forth in this Section 8 shall govern the early termination of this Agreement (or any Service).\n\n8.2. For Cause. If either party fails to perform any of its material obligations (including Section 7.1 hereof) under this Agreement (a \"Default\") and does not cure such Default in accordance with this Section, then the non-defaulting party may, by giving notice to the other party, terminate this Agreement as of the date specified in such notice of termination, or such later date agreed to by the parties, and/or recover Damages. Except as provided in Section 4.1 C, a party may terminate the Agreement in accordance with the foregoing if such party provides written notice to the defaulting party and either (a) the defaulting party does not cure the Default within sixty (60) days of the defaulting party's receipt of notice of the Default, if the Default is capable of cure within sixty (60) days, or (b) if the Default is not capable of cure within sixty (60) days, the defaulting party does not both (i) implement a plan to cure the Default within sixty (60) days of receipt of notice of the Default, and (ii) diligently carry-out the plan in accordance with its terms.

Termination for Convenience. Customer may elect to terminate this Agreement for any reason upon six months written notice to Metavante, provided Customer shall pay Metavante the \"Termination Fee\" defined and computed in accordance with the table below.

In addition to the foregoing, Customer shall pay to Metavante any amortized but unpaid one-time set-up fees, enhancement fees or implementation fees and all reasonable costs in connection with the disposition of equipment, facilities and contracts exclusively related to Metavante's performance of the Services under this Agreement.\n\nThe Termination Fee shall be an amount equal to a percentage of the Estimated Remaining Value as set forth below.

The Termination Fee shall be equal to the Estimated Remaining Value\n\n\u00a9 2006, Metavante Corporation\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if the Customer chose to terminate for convenience on an agreement with a Commencement Date of January 01, 2007 and provided written notice on July 15, 2009 for a termination date of January 15, 2010, the Estimated Remaining Value would be the average monthly fee during 2009 multiplied by 47 and the Termination Fee would be the Estimated Remaining Value.\n\n8.5. *The information in this paragraph is intentionally omitted because confidential treatment has been requested pursuant to Rule 24b- 2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The omitted information has been filed separately with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n8.6. Cease and Desist Order.

Tort Claim Waiver. In addition to and not in limitation of any other provision of this Article 9, each party hereby knowingly, voluntarily, and intentionally waives any right to recover from the other party, and Customer waives any right to recover from any Eligible Provider, any economic losses or damages in any action brought under tort theories, including, misrepresentation, negligence and/or strict liability, and/or relating to the quality or performance of any products or services provided by Metavante. For purposes of this waiver, economic losses and damages include monetary losses or damages caused by a defective product or service except personal injury or damage to other tangible property. Even if remedies provided under this Agreement shall be deemed to have failed of their essential purpose, neither party shall have any liability to the other party under tort theories for economic losses or damages.\n\n9.6. Liquidated Damages. Customer acknowledges that Metavante shall suffer a material adverse impact on its business if this Agreement is terminated prior to expiration of the Term, and that the resulting damages may not be susceptible of precise determination. Customer acknowledges that the Termination Fee is a reasonable approximation of such damages and shall be deemed to be liquidated damages and not a penalty.\n\n\u00a9 2006, Metavante Corporation\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.7.

Weeks Prior     To Conversion   Event 37 Weeks   Project Organization and Administration\n\n  Specific individuals to support this Conversion will be assigned at the Customer and at Metavante. Internal project initiation documents will be completed, and a detailed project plan will be developed at Metavante.       36 Weeks   Project Kickoff Meeting\n\n\n\nA kickoff meeting is held at the bank to introduce Metavante Conversion Project Management to the Customer's project team. The overall Conversion process will be reviewed. Specific details will be discussed regarding project scope, roles and responsibilities, Conversion major events, and critical success factors.         Equipment/Network Assessment\n\n\n\nEach office will be visited to record the layout of each location from a network perspective and to inventory existing equipment, including terminals, printers, ATM machines, controllers, and modems. This information will be evaluated to determine requirements for the future.         High-Level Application and Operations Review\n\n\n\nA discussion of each application will be conducted at a high level to better understand services provided to existing customers. Current operational processes supported, such as item capture, statement rendering, and exception items, will be reviewed as well as interfaces to the current processor to clarify service requirements and special needs.         Conversion Tapes Ordered     Conversion tapes will be ordered from the appropriate service providers.       30 Weeks   Equipment/Network Plan Development\n\n  Based on the Equipment/Network Assessment, an Equipment/Network Plan with a network design and hardware/software requirements will be developed.

Each field will be discussed for clarification and determination of the corresponding use on the Metavante System. All backroom support will be reviewed, a general training plan will be developed, and enhancements will be identified.       16 Weeks   Training Bank and Training Network Established\n\n  A training Bank will be set up on the Metavante system to facilitate training of Bank staff and testing of the Conversion. The appropriate network and equipment will be installed at designated training locations.       10 Weeks   Test Report Review\n\n  Conversion Test Reports will be reviewed by the product support representative with key contacts at the Bank to verify accuracy of the Conversion process.

Nightly posting will be run with item capture test files as input, reports will be produced, and the test Bank will be balanced each day. Bank personnel will be asked to support all functions of this test using operational procedures from data entry to balancing. This will give Bank staff a chance to practice using the system and gain confidence before dealing with their customers in a production environment. It also will serve to validate network configuration, interface processes, staff training, and operational procedures. Issues will be identified and addressed.       2 Weeks   Final Preparation for Conversion\n\n\n\nTechnical setup for the Conversion will be reviewed for accuracy, and follow-up calls will be made to external firms supporting the Bank to confirm previously made arrangements (Federal Reserve, current software vendors, ATM support, etc.). A detailed Conversion Weekend Plan will be developed and distributed to all key contacts.       0 Weeks   Files Converted, \"Live\" on Metavante\n\n  Files will be converted to Metavante over Conversion weekend, after posting on the old processor for Friday night.

CONFIDENTIALITY.     8.1 Confidentiality Obligations. Except as permitted elsewhere under this Agreement, each Party agrees (a) to take Reasonable Steps (as  defined below) to receive and maintain the Confidential Information of the other Party in confidence, (b) to take Reasonable Steps (as defined  below) not to disclose such Confidential Information to any third parties other than with the written consent of the disclosing Party and (c) to  promptly notify the other Party upon learning of any law, rule, regulation or court order that purports to compel disclosure of any Confidential  Information of the other Party and to reasonably cooperate with the other Party in the exercise of the other Party's right to protect the  confidentiality of such Confidential Information, including, but not limited to, seeking to dispute the cause of such disclosure and/or to receive confidential treatment for the Confidential Information disclosed as a result of such cause. Neither Party shall use all or any part of the Confidential  Information of the other Party for any purpose other than to perform its obligations, or the exercise of such Party's rights and licenses, under this  Agreement. Each Party shall (i) limit access to any Confidential Information of the other Party received by it to its employees, contractors,  consultants and agents who have a need-to-know in connection with the performance of such Party's obligations, or the exercise of such Party's rights, under this Agreement; and (ii) advise such employees, contractors, consultants and agents of the confidential nature thereof and of the  obligations set forth in this Agreement and similarly bind them in writing. Each Party shall be responsible for any breaches of the obligations of  confidentiality and restricted use set forth herein by any employee, contractor, consultant or agent to whom such Party disclosed any Confidential  Information of the other Party. As used herein, \"Reasonable Steps\" means using at least the same degree of care that the receiving Party uses to  protect its own Confidential Information, and, in any event, no less than reasonable care.      8.2 Exclusions. Nothing contained herein shall prevent a Party from disclosing Confidential Information pursuant to any applicable law or  by a governmental order, decree, regulation, rule, process or court order; provided, however, that such Party complies with the notice provisions  of Section 8.1(c) to the extent permissible under applicable laws, rules, regulations or court orders. Such disclosure shall not of itself alter the  status of such information hereunder for all other purposes as Confidential Information.     8.3 Provisions of this Agreement. Each Party agrees that the provisions of this Agreement shall be treated as Confidential Information  and that no reference shall be made thereto without the prior written consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld) except (a) to its accountants, banks, financing sources, lawyers and other professional advisors, provided that such parties undertake in  writing (or are otherwise bound by rules of professional conduct) to keep such information strictly confidential, (b) in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement, (c) in connection with a merger, acquisition or proposed merger or acquisition, or (d) pursuant to joint press  releases prepared in good faith or (e) as permitted under Section 8.2.

Upon termination of this Agreement, all Confidential Information shall be returned to the disclosing Party or destroyed  unless otherwise specified or permitted elsewhere under this Agreement or as otherwise mutually agreed upon by the Parties. The confidentiality  obligations contained in this Section 8 shall survive termination of this Agreement for a period of three years.     8.5 Injunction. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this Section 8 are reasonable and necessary to protect the  other Party's interests in its Confidential Information, that any breach of the provisions of this Section 8 may result in irreparable harm to such  other Party, and in such event the exact amount of damages is now and will be difficult to ascertain and the remedies at law for any such failure  would not be reasonable or adequate. Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Section 8 by a Party  hereto, the other Party, in addition to any other relief available to it at law, in equity or otherwise, shall be entitled to seek temporary and permanent  injunctive relief restraining the breaching Party from engaging in and/or continuing such conduct, without the necessity of proving actual  damages or posting a bond or other security.

Each Party shall (i) limit access to any Confidential Information of the other Party received by it to its employees, contractors,  consultants and agents who have a need-to-know in connection with the performance of such Party's obligations, or the exercise of such Party's rights, under this Agreement; and (ii) advise such employees, contractors, consultants and agents of the confidential nature thereof and of the  obligations set forth in this Agreement and similarly bind them in writing. Each Party shall be responsible for any breaches of the obligations of  confidentiality and restricted use set forth herein by any employee, contractor, consultant or agent to whom such Party disclosed any Confidential  Information of the other Party. As used herein, \"Reasonable Steps\" means using at least the same degree of care that the receiving Party uses to  protect its own Confidential Information, and, in any event, no less than reasonable care.      8.2 Exclusions. Nothing contained herein shall prevent a Party from disclosing Confidential Information pursuant to any applicable law or  by a governmental order, decree, regulation, rule, process or court order; provided, however, that such Party complies with the notice provisions  of Section 8.1(c) to the extent permissible under applicable laws, rules, regulations or court orders. Such disclosure shall not of itself alter the  status of such information hereunder for all other purposes as Confidential Information.     8.3 Provisions of this Agreement. Each Party agrees that the provisions of this Agreement shall be treated as Confidential Information  and that no reference shall be made thereto without the prior written consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld) except (a) to its accountants, banks, financing sources, lawyers and other professional advisors, provided that such parties undertake in  writing (or are otherwise bound by rules of professional conduct) to keep such information strictly confidential, (b) in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement, (c) in connection with a merger, acquisition or proposed merger or acquisition, or (d) pursuant to joint press  releases prepared in good faith or (e) as permitted under Section 8.2.

Upon termination of this Agreement, all Confidential Information shall be returned to the disclosing Party or destroyed  unless otherwise specified or permitted elsewhere under this Agreement or as otherwise mutually agreed upon by the Parties. The confidentiality  obligations contained in this Section 8 shall survive termination of this Agreement for a period of three years.     8.5 Injunction. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this Section 8 are reasonable and necessary to protect the  other Party's interests in its Confidential Information, that any breach of the provisions of this Section 8 may result in irreparable harm to such  other Party, and in such event the exact amount of damages is now and will be difficult to ascertain and the remedies at law for any such failure  would not be reasonable or adequate. Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Section 8 by a Party  hereto, the other Party, in addition to any other relief available to it at law, in equity or otherwise, shall be entitled to seek temporary and permanent  injunctive relief restraining the breaching Party from engaging in and/or continuing such conduct, without the necessity of proving actual  damages or posting a bond or other security.

Rights of Termination (a) Regulatory Proceedings Out If, after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Time, any enquiry, action, suit, investigation or other proceeding, whether formal or informal, is instituted or announced or any order is made by any federal, provincial or other Governmental Authority in relation to the Corporation which, in the opinion of any of the Agents, operates to prevent or restrict the distribution or trading of the Offered Shares, then such Agent shall be entitled, at its option and in accordance with Section 10(e), to terminate its obligations under this Agreement by notice to that effect given to the Corporation any time at or prior to the Closing Time. (b) Disaster Out If prior to the Closing Time there should develop, occur or come into effect or existence any event, action, state, condition or major financial occurrence of national or international consequence or any law or regulation which, in the opinion of any of the Agents, seriously adversely affects, or involves, or will seriously adversely affect, or involve, the financial markets or the business, operations or affairs of the Corporation and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, then such Agent shall be entitled, at its option and in accordance with Section 10(e), to terminate its obligations under this Agreement by written notice to that effect given to the Corporation at any time at or prior to the Closing Time. (c) Material Change or Change in Material Fact Out If, after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Time, there shall occur any material change or change in a material fact which, in the reasonable opinion of any of the Agents, would be expected to have a significant adverse effect on the business, affairs, prospects or financial condition of the Corporation and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or the market price or value of the securities of the Corporation, then such Agent shall be entitled, at its option, in accordance with Section 10(e), to terminate its obligations under this Agreement by written notice to that effect given to the Corporation any time at or prior to the Closing Time.

Each Agent may waive, in whole or in part, or extend the time for compliance with, any terms and conditions without prejudice to its rights in respect of any other terms and conditions or any other or subsequent breach or non- compliance, provided that any such waiver or extension shall be binding upon an Agent only if such waiver or extension is in writing and signed by the Agent. 20\n\n(e) Exercise of Termination Rights The rights of termination contained in Sections 10(a), (b), (c) and (d) may be exercised by any of the Agents and are in addition to any other rights or remedies any of the Agents may have in respect of any default, act or failure to act or non- compliance by the Corporation in respect of any of the matters contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise. In the event of any such termination, there shall be no further liability on the part of the Agents to the Corporation or on the part of the Corporation to the Agents except in respect of any liability which may have arisen prior to or arise after such termination under Sections 11, 12 and 14. A notice of termination given by an Agent under Section 10(a), (b), (c) or (d) shall not be binding upon any other Agent who has not also executed such notice. 11. Indemnity (a) Rights of Indemnity (1) The Corporation covenants and agrees to protect, indemnify, and save harmless, each of the Agents and their respective affiliates, and each and every one of the directors, officers, employees, partners and agents of the Agents (individually, an \"Indemnified Party\" and collectively, the \"Indemnified Parties\") harmless from and against any and all expenses, losses (excluding loss of profits), claims, actions, damages (other than consequential or punitive damages) or liabilities, joint or several (including the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any actions, suits, proceedings or claims and the reasonable fees and expenses of their counsel that may be incurred in advising with respect to and/or defending any claim that may be made against the Indemnified Parties) to which any Indemnified Party may become subject or otherwise involved in any capacity under any statute or common law or otherwise insofar as such expenses, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based, directly or indirectly, upon the performance of professional services rendered to the Corporation by the Indemnified Parties (or any of them), whether directly or indirectly, including by reason of: (a) any information or statement contained in this Agreement, the Corporation's publicly available disclosed documents filed on SEDAR or elsewhere, or in any other material prepared by the Corporation used for marketing the Offering or any certificate of the Corporation delivered hereunder or pursuant hereto, which at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it was made contains or is alleged to contain a misrepresentation or any misstatement of a material fact; 21\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) the omission or alleged omission to state in in this Agreement, the Corporation's publicly available disclosed documents filed on SEDAR or elsewhere, or in any other material prepared by the Corporation used for marketing the Offering or any certificate of the Corporation delivered hereunder or pursuant hereto, any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make any statement therein not misleading in light of the circumstances in which it was made; (c) any order made, or inquiry, investigation or proceeding commenced by any securities regulatory authority or other competent authority based upon any misrepresentation, untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission in this Agreement, the Corporation's publicly available disclosed documents filed on SEDAR or elsewhere, or in any other material prepared by the Corporation used for marketing the Offering or any certificate of the Corporation delivered hereunder or pursuant hereto that prevents or restricts the trading in any of the Corporation's securities or the distribution or distribution to the public, as the case may be, of any of the Offered Shares in any of the Qualifying Jurisdictions; (d) the Corporation not complying with any requirement of Applicable Securities Laws or stock exchange requirements in connection with the transactions contemplated herein, including the Corporation's non-compliance with any statutory requirement to make any document available for inspection; or (e) any breach of a representation or warranty of the Corporation contained in this Agreement or the failure of the Corporation to comply with any of its obligations hereunder. (2) Notwithstanding Subsection 11(a) (1), the indemnification in Subsection 11(a)(1) does not and shall not apply to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment that has become non- appealable shall determine that (a) the Agents and their respective affiliates have been negligent or have committed any fraudulent or illegal act in the course of the professional services rendered to the Corporation, and (b) such expenses, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions were caused or incurred by the gross negligence, fraud or wilful misconduct of the Agents. (3) If any matter or thing contemplated by this Section 11 shall be asserted against any Indemnified Party in respect of which indemnification is or might reasonably be considered to be provided, such Indemnified Party will notify the Corporation in writing as soon as possible of the nature of such claim (provided that omission to so notify the Corporation will not relieve the Corporation of any liability that it may otherwise have to the Indemnified Party hereunder, except to the extent the Corporation is materially prejudiced by such omission) and the Corporation shall be entitled (but not required) to assume the defence of any suit brought to enforce such claim; provided, however, that the defence shall be through legal counsel reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Party and that no settlement may be made by the Corporation or such Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the other, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. 22\n\n\n\n\n\n(4) In any such claim, such Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain other legal counsel to act on such Indemnified Party's behalf, provided that the fees and disbursements of such other legal counsel shall be paid by such Indemnified Party, unless: (a) the employment of such counsel has been authorized by the Corporation; or (b) the Corporation has not assumed the defence and employed counsel thereof promptly after receiving notice of such claim; or (c) the named parties to any such claim include both the Indemnified Party and the Corporation, and the Indemnified Party has been advised by legal counsel thereto that representation of both the Corporation and the Indemnified Party by the same legal counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them; or (d) there are one or more defences available to the Indemnified Party which are different from and in addition to those available to the Corporation, provided that the Corporation shall not be responsible for the fees or expenses of more than one legal firm in any single jurisdiction for all of the Indemnified Parties. (5) To the extent that any Indemnified Party is not a party to this Underwriting Agreement, the Agents shall obtain and hold the right and benefit of this Section 11 in trust for and on behalf of such Indemnified Party. (6) The Corporation hereby consents to personal jurisdiction in any court in which any claim that is subject to indemnification hereunder is brought against the Agents or any Indemnified Party and to the assignment of the benefit of this Section 11 to any Indemnified Party for the purpose of enforcement provided that nothing herein shall limit the Corporation's right or ability to contest the appropriate jurisdiction or forum for the determination of any such claims. (7) The rights of the Corporation contained in this Section 11 shall not enure to the benefit of any Indemnified Party if the Agents were provided with a copy of any amendment or supplement to this Agreement which corrects any untrue statement or omission or alleged omission that is the basis of a claim by a party against such Indemnified Party and that is required, under the Applicable Securities Laws, to be delivered to such party by the Agents. (8) The Corporation shall not be liable under this Section 11 for any settlement of any claim or action effected without its prior written consent. 23\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Notification of Claims If any matter or thing contemplated by Section 11(a) (any such matter or thing being referred to as a \"Claim\") is asserted against any person or company in respect of which indemnification is or might reasonably be considered to be provided, such person or company (the \"Indemnified Party\") will notify the Corporation as soon as possible of the nature of such Claim (but the omission so to notify the Corporation of any potential Claim shall not relieve the Corporation from any liability which they may have to any Indemnified Party and any omission so to notify the Corporation of any actual Claim shall affect the Corporation's liability only to the extent that the Corporation is materially prejudiced by that failure). The Corporation shall assume the defence of any suit brought to enforce such Claim, provided, however, that (i) the defence shall be conducted through legal counsel acceptable to the Indemnified Party, acting reasonably, and (ii) no settlement of any such Claim or admission of liability may be made by the Corporation without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, acting reasonably, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act, by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party. (c) Right of Indemnity in Favour of Others With respect to any Indemnified Party who is not a party to this Agreement, the Agents shall obtain and hold the rights and benefits of this Section 11 in trust for and on behalf of such Indemnified Party. (d) Retaining Counsel In any such Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain one separate counsel to act on his or its behalf, provided that the fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party unless: (i) the Corporation and the Indemnified Party shall have mutually agreed in writing to the retention of the other counsel; (ii) the named parties to any such Claim (including any added third or impleaded party) include both the Indemnified Party and the Corporation and the Indemnified Party shall have been advised in writing by counsel to the Indemnified Party that the representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to an actual or potential conflict of interest between the Corporation and the Indemnified Party; or (iii) the Corporation shall not have retained counsel within seven Business Days following receipt by the Corporation of notice of any such Claim from the Indemnified Party; provided that the Corporation shall not be responsible for the fees or expenses of more than one legal firm in any single jurisdiction for all of the Indemnified Parties. 24\n\n\n\n\n\n12. Contribution (a) Rights of Contribution In order to provide for a just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity provided in Section 11 would otherwise be available in accordance with its terms but is, for any reason, held to be unavailable to or unenforceable by the Agents or enforceable otherwise than in accordance with its terms, the Corporation and the Agents shall contribute to the aggregate of all claims, expenses, costs and liabilities and all losses (other than loss of profits) of a nature contemplated by Section 11 in such proportions so that the Agents shall be responsible for the portion represented by the percentage that the aggregate Agents' Fee hereunder bears to the aggregate offering price of the Offered Shares being sold by the Corporation and the Corporation shall be responsible for the balance, whether or not they have been sued together or sued separately, provided, however, that (i) the Agents shall not in any event be liable to contribute, in the aggregate, any amounts in excess of the aggregate Agents' Fee actually received by the Agents from the Corporation under this Agreement; (ii) each Agent shall not in any event be liable to contribute, individually, any amount in excess of such Agents' portion of the aggregate Agents' Fee actually received from the Corporation under this Agreement; and (iii) no party who has engaged in any fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, wilful misconduct or negligence shall be entitled to claim contribution from any person who has not engaged in such fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, wilful misconduct or negligence. (b) Rights of Contribution in Addition to Other Rights The rights to contribution provided in this Section 12 shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other right to contribution which the Agents may have by statute or otherwise at law. (c) Right of Contribution in Favour of Others With respect to this Section 12, the Corporation acknowledges and agrees that the Agents are contracting on their own behalf and as agents for their affiliates, directors, officers, employees and agents. For purposes of this Section 12, each person, if any, who controls an Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the U.S. Securities Act or Section 20 of the U.S. Exchange Act and each Agents' affiliates and selling agents shall have the same rights to contribution as such Agent and each person, if any, who controls the Corporation within the meaning of Section 15 of the U.S. Securities Act or Section 20 of the U.S. Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Corporation. The Agents' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 12 are several in proportion to the percentages of Agents' Fee set forth opposite their respective names in Section 5(a) hereof and not joint. 25\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Remedy Not Exclusive The remedies provided for in this Section 12 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any party at law or in equity. 13. Severability If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be void or unenforceable in whole or in part, it shall be deemed not to affect or impair the validity of any other provision of this Agreement and such void or unenforceable provision shall be severable from this Agreement. 14. Expenses (a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be completed, all expenses of or incidental to the issue, sale and delivery of the Offered Shares and all expenses of or incidental to all other matters in connection with the offering of the Offered Shares shall be borne by the Corporation including, without limitation, all fees and disbursements of all legal counsel to the Corporation (including U.S., foreign and local counsel), all fees and disbursements of the Corporation's accountants and auditors, all expenses related to road shows and marketing activities, all printing costs incurred in connection with the offering of the Offered Shares, including certificates, if any, representing the Offered Shares, all filing fees, all fees and expenses relating to listing the Offered Shares on any exchanges, all transfer agent fees and expenses, and all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Agents incurred in connection with the offering of the Offered Shares, including without limitation the fees of Canadian counsel to the Agents which shall not exceed $50,000 (not including applicable taxes and disbursements and $10,000 USD plus tax and disbursements for U.S. Counsel), and any advertising, printing, courier, telecommunications, data search, presentation, travel and other expenses incurred by the Agents together with all related taxes (including, without limitation, provincial sales taxes and HST). (b) All expenses payable by the Corporation to the Agent in accordance with this Agreement shall be payable whether or not the Offering is completed. 15. Survival of Representations and Warranties The representations, warranties, obligations and agreements of the Corporation contained in this Agreement and in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with the purchase and sale of the Offered Shares shall survive the payment by the Agents for the Offered Shares, if any, and the distribution of the Offered Shares, and shall continue in full force and effect unaffected by the termination of the Agents' obligations and shall not be limited or prejudiced by any investigation made by or on behalf of the Agents in connection with the distribution of the Offered Shares. 26\n\n\n\n\n\n16. Entire Agreement This Agreement, including any schedules hereto, represents the entire agreement of the parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof and there are no representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements relating to the subject matter hereof except as stated or referred to herein. This Agreement shall not be amended or varied in its terms by oral agreement or by representations or otherwise except by instrument in writing executed by the duly authorized representatives of the parties hereto or their respective successors or assigns.

Amendment No modification or amendment to this Agreement may be made unless agreed upon by the Corporation and the Agents in writing. 18. Assignment and Enurement No party may transfer or assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties and any transfer or assignment or purported transfer or assignment in contravention of this Section 18 shall be void and without force or effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall enure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 19. Time Time is of the essence in the performance of the parties' respective obligations under this Agreement. 20.

Investment Banking  10 South Wacker Drive, Suite 3400  Chicago, Illinois 60606\n\nLadies and Gentlemen:\n\nAthens Bancshares Corporation, a Tennessee corporation (the \"Company\"), and Athens Federal Community Bank, a federal savings bank located  in Athens, Tennessee (the \"Bank\") (references to the \"Bank\" include the Bank in mutual or stock form as indicated by the context), the deposit  accounts of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\"), hereby confirm their agreement with Keefe, Bruyette &  Woods, Inc. (the \"Agent\") as follows:\n\nSection 1. The Offering. The Bank, in accordance with its plan of conversion adopted by its Board of Directors (the \"Plan\"), intends to convert  from a federally-chartered mutual savings bank to a federal stock savings bank (the \"Conversion\"), and issue all of its issued and outstanding  capital stock to the Company. The Conversion will be accomplished pursuant to federal law and the rules and regulations of the Office of Thrift  Supervision (the \"OTS\"). Pursuant to the Plan, the Company will offer and sell up to shares (subject to increase up to shares) of its common stock,  $.01 par value per share (the \"Shares\" or \"Common Shares\"), in a subscription offering (the \"Subscription Offering\") to (1) depositors of the Bank  with Qualifying Deposits (as defined in the Plan) as of March 31, 2008 (\"Eligible Account Holders\"), (2) the employee stock ownership plan  established by either the Bank or the Company (the \"ESOP\"), (3) depositors of the Bank with Qualifying Deposits as of September 30, 2009  (\"Supplemental Eligible Account Holders\"), and (4) other depositor and borrower members of the Bank as defined in the Plan. Subject to the prior  subscription rights of the above-listed parties, the Company may offer for sale in a community offering (the \"Community Offering\" and when  referred to together with or subsequent to the Subscription Offering, the \"Subscription and Community Offering\") the Shares not subscribed for or  ordered in the Subscription Offering to members of the general public to whom a copy of the Prospectus (as hereinafter defined) is delivered with a  preference given first to natural persons who are residents of Blount, Bradley, Hamilton, Knox, Loudon, McMinn, Meras, Monroe and Polk  Counties in Tennessee. It is anticipated that shares not subscribed for in the Subscription and Community Offering may be offered to certain  members of the general public on a best efforts basis through a selected dealers agreement (the \"Syndicated Community Offering\") (the  Subscription Offering, Community Offering and Syndicated Community Offering are collectively referred to as the \"Offering\"). It is acknowledged  that the purchase of Shares in the Offering is subject to the maximum and minimum purchase limitations as described in the Plan and that the  Company may reject, in whole or in part, any orders received in the Community Offering or Syndicated Community Offering.\n\nIn connection with the Conversion and pursuant to the terms of the Plan as described in the Prospectus, immediately following the consummation  of the Conversion, subject to the approval of the Bank's depositors and compliance with certain conditions as may be imposed by regulatory  authorities, the Company will contribute $100,000 and 100,000 shares of Common Stock to the Athens Federal Foundation (the \"Foundation\") such  shares hereinafter being referred to as the (\"Foundation Shares\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"Commission\") a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-   )  (the \"Registration Statement\"), containing a prospectus relating to the Offering, for the registration of the Shares under the Securities Act of 1933  (the \"1933 Act\"), and has filed such amendments thereof and such amended prospectuses as may have been required to the date hereof. The term  \"Registration Statement\" shall include any documents incorporated by reference therein and all financial schedules and exhibits thereto, as  amended, including post-effective amendments. The prospectus, as amended, on file with the Commission at the time the Registration Statement  initially became effective is hereinafter called the \"Prospectus,\" except that if any Prospectus is filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c)  of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (the \"1933 Act Regulations\") differing from the prospectus on file at the time  the Registration Statement initially became effective, the term \"Prospectus\" shall refer to the prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c) from  and after the time said prospectus is filed with the Commission.\n\nIn accordance with Title 12, Part 563b of the Code of Federal Regulations (the \"Conversion Regulations\"), the Bank has filed with the OTS an  Application For Conversion on Form AC (the \"Form AC\"), including the Prospectus and the Conversion Valuation Appraisal Report prepared by  Keller & Company, Inc. (the \"Appraisal\") and has filed such amendments thereto as may have been required by the OTS. The Form AC has been  approved by the OTS and the related Prospectus has been authorized for use by the OTS. In addition, the Company has filed with the OTS its  Application H-(e)l-S (the \"Holding Company Application\") to become a savings and loan holding company under the Home Owners' Loan Act, as  amended (\"HOLA\") and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the \"Control Act Regulations\").\n\nSection 2. Retention and Compensation of Agent. Subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Company and the Bank hereby appoint  the Agent as their exclusive financial advisor and marketing agent (i) to utilize its best efforts to solicit subscriptions for Common Shares and to  advise and assist the Company and the Bank with respect to the Company's sale of the Shares in the Offering and (ii) to participate in the Offering  in the areas of market making and in syndicate formation (if necessary).\n\nOn the basis of the representations, warranties, and agreements herein contained, but subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the  Agent accepts such appointment and agrees to consult with and advise the Company and the Bank as to the matters set forth in the letter  agreement, dated June 9, 2009, between the Bank and the Agent (a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A) (the \"Engagement Letter\"). It is  acknowledged by the Company and the Bank that the Agent shall not be required to purchase any Shares or be obligated to take any action which  is inconsistent with all applicable laws, regulations, decisions or orders.\n\nThe obligations of the Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate upon termination of the Offering, but in no event later than 45 days after  the completion of the Subscription Offering (the \"End Date\"). All fees or expenses due to the Agent but unpaid will be payable to the Agent in  next day funds at the earlier of the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) or the End Date. In the event the Offering is extended beyond the End  Date, the Company and the Agent may agree to renew this Agreement under mutually acceptable terms.\n\nIn the event the Company is unable to sell a minimum of    Shares within the period herein provided, this Agreement shall terminate and the  Company shall refund to any persons who have subscribed for any of the Shares the full amount which it may have received from them plus  accrued interest, as set forth in the Prospectus; and none of the parties to this Agreement shall have any obligation to the other parties hereunder,  except as set forth in this Section 2 and in Sections 7, 9 and 10 hereof. In the event the Offering is terminated for any reason not attributable to the  action or inaction of the Agent, the Agent shall be paid the fees due to the date of such termination pursuant to subparagraphs (a) and (d) below.\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Agent shall receive the following compensation for its services hereunder:\n\n(a) A management fee of $30,000 payable in four consecutive monthly installments of $7,500 each commencing with the execution of the  Engagement Letter. This fee shall be deemed to have been earned when due and shall be non-refundable.\n\n(b) A success fee upon completion of the Offering of 1.125% of the aggregate purchase price of the Common Shares sold in the Subscription  Offering and Community Offering excluding shares purchased by the Bank's officers, directors, or employees (or members of their immediate  family), any ESOP, tax-qualified or stock-based compensation plans (except IRAs) or similar plan created by the Bank or the Company for some or  all of its directors or employees, or contributed to any charitable foundation established by the Bank in connection with the Conversion. In no  event shall the success fee paid for the sale of Common Stock in the Subscription and Community Offering be less than $200,000. The management  fee will be applied against the first success fee.\n\n(c) If any of the Common Shares remain available after the Subscription Offering, at the request of the Company, the Agent will seek to form a  syndicate of registered broker-dealers (\"Selected Dealers\") to assist in the sale of such Common Shares on a best efforts basis, subject to the  terms and conditions set forth in the selected dealers agreement. The Agent will endeavor to distribute the Common Shares among the Selected  Dealers in a fashion which best meets the distribution objectives of the Bank and the Plan. The Agent will be paid a fee not to exceed 5.5% of the  aggregate Purchase Price of the Shares sold in the Syndicated Community Offering. The Agent will pass onto the Selected Dealers who assist in  the Syndicated Community Offering an amount competitive with gross underwriting discounts charged at such time for comparable amounts of  stock sold at a comparable price per share in a similar market environment. Fees with respect to purchases effected with the assistance of Selected  Dealers other than the Agent shall be transmitted by the Agent to such Selected Dealers. The decision to utilize Selected Dealers will be made by  the Company upon consultation with the Agent.\n\n(d) The Company and the Bank shall reimburse the Agent for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including costs of travel, meals and lodging,  photocopying, telephone, facsimile and couriers. The Company and the Bank will reimburse the Agent for the fees and expenses of the Agent's  counsel which will not exceed $50,000. The Company will bear the expenses of the Offering customarily borne by issuers including, without  limitation, regulatory filing fees, SEC, \"Blue Sky,\" and FINRA filing and registration fees; the fees of the Company's accountants, attorneys,  appraiser, transfer agent and registrar, printing, mailing and marketing and syndicate expenses associated with the conversion; and the fees set  forth under this Section 2; and any fees for Blue Sky legal work.\n\nFull payment of the Agent's actual and accountable expenses, advisory fees and compensation shall be made in next day funds on the earlier of  the Closing Date or a determination by the Bank to terminate or abandon the Offering. The payment of such expenses assume no unusual  circumstances or delays, or a re-solicitation in connection with the subscription and community offering. The Company and the Bank acknowledge  that such expense cap may be increased by mutual consent, including in the event of a material delay in the Offering which would require an  update of the financial information in tabular form to reflect a period later than that set forth in the original filing.\n\nSection 3. Sale and Delivery of Shares. If all conditions precedent to the consummation of the Conversion, including without limitation, the sale of  all Shares required by the Plan to be sold, are satisfied, the Company agrees to issue, or have issued, the Shares sold in the Offering and to release  for delivery certificates for such Shares on the Closing Date against payment to the Company by any means authorized by the Plan; provided,  however, that no funds shall be released to the Company until the conditions specified in Section 8 hereof shall have been complied with to the  reasonable satisfaction of the Agent and its counsel. The release of Shares against payment therefor shall be made on a date and at a place  acceptable to the Company, the Bank and the Agent. Certificates for shares shall be delivered\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndirectly to the purchasers in accordance with their directions. The date upon which the Company shall release or deliver the shares sold in the  Offering, in accordance with the terms herein, is called the \"Closing Date.\"\n\nSection 4.

If required to be filed, the Company has filed any issuer free writing  prospectus related to the offered Shares at the time it is required to be filed under Rule 433 of the 1933 Act Regulations and, if not required to be  filed, will retain such free writing prospectus in the Company's records pursuant to Rule 433(g) of the 1933 Act Regulations and if any issuer free  writing prospectus is used after the date hereof in connection with the offering of the Shares the Company will file or retain such free writing  prospectus as required by Rule 433 of the 1933 Act Regulations.\n\n(c) As of the Applicable Time, neither (i) the Issuer-Represented General Free Writing Prospectus(es) issued at or prior to the Applicable Time and  the Statutory Prospectus, all considered together (collectively, the \"General Disclosure Package\"), nor (ii) any individual Issuer-Represented  Limited-Use Free Writing Prospectus, when considered together with the General Disclosure Package, included any untrue statement of a material  fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were  made, not misleading.

At the time of the approval of the Form AC, including the  Prospectus (including any amendment or supplement thereto) by the OTS and at all times subsequent thereto until the Closing Date, the Form AC,  including the Prospectus (including any amendment or supplement thereto), will comply in all material respects with the Conversion Regulations,  except to the extent waived or otherwise approved by the OTS.

The Company and the Bank have not distributed any offering  material in connection with the Offering except for the Prospectus and any supplemental sales material that has been filed with the Registration  Statement and the Form AC and authorized for use by the Commission and the OTS.

The information under the caption \"The Conversion  and Stock Offering \u2014 Material Income Tax Consequences\" has been reviewed by such counsel and fairly describes the federal and state tax  opinions rendered by them and Hazlett, Lewis & Bieter, PLLC, respectively, to the Company and the Bank with respect to such matters.\n\nIn addition, such counsel shall state that during the preparation of the Form AC, the Holding Company Application, the Registration Statement,  the Prospectus and the General Disclosure Package, they participated in conferences with certain officers of, the independent public and internal  accountants for, and other representatives of, the Company and the Bank, at which conferences the contents of the Form AC, the Holding  Company Application, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus and the General Disclosure Package and related matters were discussed and,  while such counsel have not confirmed the accuracy or completeness of or otherwise verified the information contained in the Form AC, the  Holding Company Application, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or the General Disclosure Package and do not assume any  responsibility for such information, based upon such conferences and a review of\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndocuments deemed relevant for the purpose of rendering their opinion (relying as to materiality as to factual matters on certificates of officers and  other factual representations by the Company), nothing has come to their attention that would lead them to believe that the Form AC, the Holding  Company Application, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the General Disclosure Package or any amendment or supplement thereto as of  the Applicable Time (other than the financial statements, the notes thereto, and other tabular, financial, statistical and appraisal data included  therein as to which no view need be rendered) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be  stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.\n\nIn giving such opinion, such counsel may rely as to all matters of fact on certificates of officers or directors of the Company and the Bank and  certificates of public officials. Such counsel's opinion shall be limited to matters governed by federal laws and by the laws of Tennessee and with  respect to enforceablity, New York law, and may add other qualifications and explanations on the basis of this opinion as may be reasonably  acceptable to the Agent.\n\n(d) A Blue Sky Memorandum from Kilpatrick Stockton LLP relating to the Offering, including Agent's participation therein, and should be  furnished to the Agent with a copy thereof addressed to Agent or upon which Kilpatrick Stockton LLP shall state the Agent may rely.

(ii) since the date the Prospectus became authorized for final use, no event has occurred which should have  been set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Prospectus which has not been so set forth, including specifically, but without limitation, any  material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise, or in the earnings, capital, properties or business of the Company or the Bank and  the conditions set forth in this Section 8 have been satisfied; (iii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration  Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there has been no material adverse change in the condition, financial or otherwise,  or in the earnings, capital, properties or business of the Company or the Bank independently, or of the Company and the Bank considered as one  enterprise, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business; (iv) the representations and warranties in Section 4 are true and correct with  the same force and effect as though expressly made at and as of the Closing Date; (v) the Company has complied in all material respects with all  agreements and satisfied all conditions on their part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the Closing Date and will comply in all material  respects with all obligations to be satisfied by them after the Closing Date;

(ii) neither the Company nor the Bank  shall have received from the OTS or the FDIC any direction (oral or written) to make any material change in the method of conducting their  business with which it has not complied (which direction, if any, shall have been disclosed to the Agent) or which materially and adversely would  affect the financial condition, results of operations or business of the Company and the Bank taken as a whole;

and (v) the Shares shall have been qualified or registered for offering and sale or exempted therefrom under the securities or  blue sky laws of the jurisdictions as the Agent shall have reasonably requested and as agreed to by the Company and the Bank.\n\n(h) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Agent shall receive a letter from Hazlett, Lewis & Bieter, PLLC, dated as of the date  hereof and addressed to the Agent: (i) confirming that Hazlett, Lewis & Bieter, PLLC is a firm of independent registered public accountants within  the applicable rules of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and stating in effect that in its opinion the consolidated  financial statements and related notes of the Company as of December 31, 2008, and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December  31, 2008, and covered by their opinion included therein, and any other more recent unaudited financial statements included in the Prospectus  comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and related published rules and regulations of the OTS and  the 1933 Act; (ii) stating in effect that, on the basis of certain agreed upon procedures (but not an audit in accordance with standards of the Public  Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)) consisting of a reading of the latest available consolidated financial statements of the  Company prepared by the Company, a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors, Executive Committee and Audit Committee  of the Company and the Bank and consultations with officers of the Company and the Bank responsible for financial and accounting matters,  nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe that:\n\n(A) audited consolidated financial statements and any unaudited interim financial statements included in the Prospectus are not in conformity with  the 1933 Act, applicable accounting requirements of the OTS and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applied  on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Prospectus; or\n\n(B) during the period from the date of the latest financial statements included in the Prospectus to a specified date not more than three business  days prior to the date of the Prospectus, except as has been described in the Prospectus, there was any increase in borrowings of the Company,  other than normal deposit fluctuations for the Bank; or (C) there was any decrease in the net assets of the Company\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nat the date of such letter as compared with amounts shown in the latest balance sheet included in the Prospectus; and (iii) stating that, in addition  to the audit referred to in their opinion included in the Prospectus and the performance of the procedures referred to in clause (ii) of this  subsection (h), they have compared with the general accounting records of the Company, which are subject to the internal controls of the  Company, the accounting system and other data prepared by the Company, directly from such accounting records, to the extent specified in such  letter, such amounts and/or percentages set forth in the Prospectus as the Agent may reasonably request; and they have found such amounts and  percentages to be in agreement therewith (subject to rounding).\n\n(i) At the Closing Date, the Agent shall receive a letter dated the Closing Date, addressed to the Agent, confirming the statements made by Hazlett,  Lewis & Bieter, PLLC in the letter delivered by it pursuant to subsection (g) of this Section 8, the \"specified date\" referred to in clause (i) of  subsection (h) to be a date specified in the letter required by this subsection (h) which for purposes of such letter shall not be more than three  business days prior to the Closing Date.\n\n(j) At the Closing Date, the Company shall receive a letter from Keller & Company, Inc., dated the Closing Date (i) confirming that said firm is  independent of the Company and the Bank and is experienced and expert in the area of corporate appraisals within the meaning of Title 12 of the  Code of Federal Regulations, Section 563b.200(b), (ii) stating in effect that the Appraisal prepared by such firm complies in all material respects  with the applicable requirements of Title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations, and (iii) further stating that its opinion of the aggregate pro forma  market value of the Company including the Bank, as most recently updated, remains in effect.\n\n(k) At or prior to the Closing Date, the Agent shall receive: (i) a copy of the letters from the OTS approving the Form AC, the Holding Company  Application and authorizing the use of the Prospectus and the establishment of the Foundation, including the issuance of shares thereto;

 and all proceedings taken by the Company and the Bank in connection with the sale of the Shares as herein contemplated shall be satisfactory in  form and substance to the Agent and its counsel.\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(n) All such opinions, certificates, letters and documents will be in compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are reasonably satisfactory  in form and substance to the Agent and to counsel for the Agent. Any certificate signed by an officer of the Company or the Bank and delivered  to the Agent or to counsel for the Agent shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Company or the Bank, as the case may be, to the  Agent as to the statements made therein.\n\nSection 9. Indemnification.\n\n(a) The Company and the Bank jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Agent, its officers and directors, employees and  agents, and each person, if any, who controls the Agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act, against  any and all loss, liability, claim, damage or expense whatsoever (including, but not limited to, settlement expenses), joint or several, that the Agent  or any of them may suffer or to which the Agent and any such persons may become subject under all applicable federal or state laws or otherwise,  and to promptly reimburse the Agent and any such persons upon written demand for any expense (including all fees and disbursements of  counsel) incurred by the Agent or any of them in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any actions, proceedings or claims  (whether commenced or threatened) to the extent such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions: (i) arise out of or are based upon any untrue  statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the  General Disclosure Package, any Issuer-Represented Limited-Use Free Writing Prospectus, preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or  supplement thereto), the Form AC (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Holding Company Application (or any amendment or  supplement thereto) or any instrument or document executed by the Company or the Bank or based upon written information supplied by the  Company filed in any state or jurisdiction to register or qualify any or all of the Shares or to claim an exemption therefrom or provided to any state  or jurisdiction to exempt the Company or the Bank as a broker-dealer or its officers, directors and employees as broker-dealers or agents, under the  securities laws thereof (collectively, the \"Blue Sky Application\"), or any document, advertisement, oral statement or communication (\"Sales  Information\") prepared, made or executed by or on behalf of the Company or the Bank with its consent and based upon written or oral information  furnished by or on behalf of the Company or the Bank, whether or not filed in any jurisdiction, in order to qualify or register the Shares or to claim  an exemption therefrom under the securities laws thereof; (ii) arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in any of the  foregoing documents or information a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the  circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (iii) arise from any theory of liability whatsoever relating to or arising from or based  upon the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement  thereto), the General Disclosure Package, any Issuer-Represented Limited-Use Free Writing Prospectus, the Form AC (or any amendment or  supplement thereto) the Holding Company Application (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information  or other documentation distributed in connection with the Conversion; provided, however, that no indemnification is required under this  paragraph (a) to the extent such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue material statement or  alleged untrue material statement in, or material omission or alleged material omission from, the Registration Statement (or any amendment or  supplement thereto), preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the General Disclosure Package, any Issuer- Represented Limited-Use Free Writing Prospectus, the Form AC, the Holding Company Application, any Blue Sky Application or Sales  Information made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company, by the Agent or its counsel regarding  the Agent, and provided, that it is agreed and understood that the only information furnished in writing to the Company, by the Agent regarding  the Agent is set forth in the Prospectus under the caption \"The Conversion and Stock Offering \u2014 Marketing Arrangements\"; and, provided  further, that such indemnification shall be limited to the extent prohibited by the Commission, the OTS, the FDIC and the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System.\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) The Agent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Bank, their directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls  the Company or the Bank within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20(a) of the 1934 Act against any and all loss, liability, claim,  damage or expense whatsoever (including but not limited to settlement expenses), joint or several, which they, or any of them, may suffer or to  which they, or any of them may become subject under all applicable federal and state laws or otherwise, and to promptly reimburse the Company,  the Bank, and any such persons upon written demand for any expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by  them, or any of them, in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any actions, proceedings or claims (whether commenced or  threatened) to the extent such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions: (i) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged  untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Form AC (or any  amendment or supplement thereto), the Holding Company Application, the preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement  thereto), any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information, (ii) are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in any of the foregoing  documents a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which  they were made, not misleading, or (iii) arise from any theory of liability whatsoever relating to or arising from or based upon the Registration  Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Form AC (or  any amendment or supplement thereto), the Holding Company Application, or any Blue Sky Application or Sales Information or other  documentation distributed in connection with the Offering; provided, however, that the Agent's obligations under this Section 9(b) shall exist only if and only to the extent that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement was made in, or such material fact or alleged material fact was  omitted from, the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the preliminary or final Prospectus (or any amendment or  supplement thereto), the Form AC (or any amendment or supplement thereto), the Holding Company Application, any Blue Sky Application or  Sales Information in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company or the Bank, by the Agent or its counsel  regarding the Agent, and provided, that it is agreed and understood that the only information furnished in writing to the Company or the Bank, by  the Agent regarding the Agent is set forth in the Prospectus under the caption \"The Conversion and Stock Offering \u2014 Marketing Arrangements.\"\n\n(c) Each indemnified party shall give prompt written notice to each indemnifying party of any action, proceeding, claim (whether commenced or  threatened), or suit instituted against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall  not relieve it from any liability which it may have on account of this Section 9 or otherwise. An indemnifying party may participate at its own  expense in the defense of such action. In addition, if it so elects within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, an indemnifying party, jointly  with any other indemnifying parties receiving such notice, may assume defense of such action with counsel chosen by it and approved by the  indemnified parties that are defendants in such action, unless such indemnified parties reasonably object to such assumption on the ground that  there may be legal defenses available to them that are different from or in addition to those available to such indemnifying party. If an indemnifying  party assumes the defense of such action, the indemnifying parties shall not be liable for any fees and expenses of counsel for the indemnified  parties incurred thereafter in connection with such action, proceeding or claim, other than reasonable costs of investigation. In no event shall the  indemnifying parties be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (and any special counsel that said firm may  retain) for each indemnified party in connection with any one action, proceeding or claim or separate but similar or related actions, proceedings or  claims in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.\n\nSection 10. Contribution. In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in  Section 9 is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the Company, the Bank or the Agent, the  Company, the Bank and the Agent shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(including any investigation, legal and other expenses incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or  proceeding, but after deducting any contribution received by the Company, the Bank or the Agent from persons other than the other parties  thereto, who may also be liable for contribution) in such proportion so that the Agent is responsible for that portion represented by the percentage  that the fees paid to the Agent pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement (not including expenses) bears to the gross proceeds received by the  Company from the sale of the Shares in the Offering, and the Company and the Bank shall be responsible for the balance. If, however, the  allocation provided above is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by  such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative fault of the Company and the Bank on the one hand  and the Agent on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions,  proceedings or claims in respect thereto), but also the relative benefits received by the Company and the Bank on the one hand and the Agent on  the other from the Offering (before deducting expenses). The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the  untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by  the Company and the Bank on the one hand or the Agent on the other and the parties' relative intent, good faith, knowledge, access to information  and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the Bank and the Agent agree that it would not be just and  equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 10 were determined by pro-rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not  take into account the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 10. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result  of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions, proceedings or claims in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 10 shall be  deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any  such action, proceeding or claim. It is expressly agreed that the Agent shall not be liable for any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense or be  required to contribute any amount pursuant to Section 9(b) or this Section 10 which in the aggregate exceeds the amount paid (excluding  reimbursable expenses) to the Agent under this Agreement. It is understood that the above stated limitation on the Agent's liability is essential to  the Agent and that the Agent would not have entered into this Agreement if such limitation had not been agreed to by the parties to this  Agreement. No person found guilty of any fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to  contribution from any person who was not found guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Company, the Bank and the  Agent under this Section 10 and under Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company and the Agent may otherwise have. For  purposes of this Section 10, each of the Agent's, the Company's or the Bank's officers and directors and each person, if any, who controls the  Agent or the Company or the Bank within the meaning of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Agent on  the one hand, or, the Company or the Bank on the other hand. Any party entitled to contribution, promptly after receipt of notice of  commencement of any action, suit, claim or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against  another party under this Section 10, will notify such party from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party shall  not relieve the party from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it may have hereunder or otherwise than under this Section  10.\n\nSection 11. Survival of Agreements, Representations and Indemnities. The respective indemnities of the Company, the Bank and the Agent, the  representations and warranties and other statements of the Company, the Bank and the Agent set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement and  the provisions relating to contribution shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination or cancellation of this Agreement or any  investigation made by or on behalf of the Agent, the Company, the Bank or any controlling person referred to in Section 9 hereof, and shall  survive the termination of this Agreement and the issuance of the Shares, and any successor or assign of the Agent, the Company and the Bank,  and any such controlling person shall be entitled to the benefit of the respective agreements, indemnities, warranties and representations.\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 12. Termination. The Agent may terminate this Agreement by giving the notice indicated below in this Section 12 at any time after this  Agreement becomes effective as follows:\n\n(a) If any domestic or international event or act or occurrence has materially disrupted the United States securities markets such as to make it, in  the Agent's reasonable opinion, impracticable to proceed with the offering of the Shares; or if trading on the NYSE shall have suspended (except  that this shall not apply to the imposition of NYSE trading collars imposed on program trading); or if the United States shall have become involved  in a war or major hostilities; or if a general banking moratorium has been declared by a state or federal authority which has a material effect on the  Company on a consolidated basis; or if a moratorium in foreign exchange trading by major international banks or persons has been declared; or if  there shall have been a material adverse change in the financial condition, results of operations or business of the Bank, or if the Bank shall have  sustained a material or substantial loss by fire, flood, accident, hurricane, earthquake, theft, sabotage or other calamity or malicious act, whether or  not said loss shall have been insured; or if there shall have been a material adverse change in the financial condition, results of operations or  business of the Bank.\n\n(b) In the event the Company fails to sell the required minimum number of the Shares by the date when such sales must be completed, in  accordance with the provisions of the Plan or as required by the Conversion Regulations, and applicable law, this Agreement shall terminate upon  refund by the Company to each person who has subscribed for or ordered any of the Shares the full amount which it may have received from such  person, together with interest as provided in the Prospectus, and no party to this Agreement shall have any obligation to the other hereunder,  except as set forth in Sections 2(a) and (d), 7, 9 and 10 hereof.\n\n(c) If any of the conditions specified in Section 8 shall not have been fulfilled when and as required by this Agreement, unless waived in writing, or  by the Closing Date, this Agreement and all of the Agent's obligations hereunder may be cancelled by the Agent by notifying the Company of  such cancellation in writing or by telegram at any time at or prior to the Closing Date, and any such cancellation shall be without liability of any  party to any other party except as otherwise provided in Sections 2(a), 2(d), 7, 9 and 10 hereof.\n\n(d) If the Agent elects to terminate this Agreement as provided in this Section, the Company and the Bank shall be notified promptly by telephone  or telegram, confirmed by letter.\n\nThe Company or the Bank may terminate this Agreement in the event the Agent is in material breach of the representations and warranties or  covenants contained in Section 5 and such breach has not been cured after the Company or the Bank has provided the Agent with notice of such  breach.\n\nThis Agreement may also be terminated by mutual written consent of the parties hereto.\n\nSection 13.

MusclePharm will promptly provide all information reasonably requested by Lender and/or its valuation firm in connection with the preparation and delivery of such report. MusclePharm shall not take any position for tax purposes inconsistent with such fair market value as so determined without the consent of Lender; provided, however, that nothing herein shall preclude MusclePharm from utilizing a different method of calculating the fair market value of the Compensation Shares for financial accounting purposes if MusclePharm's Chief Financial Officer, audit committee and independent auditors shall determine in good faith that such alternative calculation of the fair market value of the Compensation Shares is required under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.   (c) In connection with the issuance of the Compensation Shares, but without limitation of Section 8(a) or the other terms and conditions in this Agreement, Lender hereby makes the following representations to MusclePharm regarding the Compensation Shares:   (i) Lender understands that, as of the date hereof, none of the Compensation Shares have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (\"Securities Act\"), by reason of a specific exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act, the availability of which depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of the investment intent and the accuracy of Lender's representations as expressed herein. Lender is acquiring all of the Compensation Shares for its own account, not as a nominee or agent, for investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution or public offering thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act.   (ii) Lender understands that all of the Compensation Shares will constitute \"restricted securities\" under the federal securities laws, inasmuch as it is being acquired from MusclePharm or such other company in one or more transactions not involving a public offering and that under such laws the Compensation Shares may not be resold without registration under the Securities Act or an exemption therefrom. The certificates representing the Compensation Shares will be endorsed with a legend to such effect.

The Minimum Purchase Quantities for the Contract Year are as set forth on Exhibit B attached hereto. Within ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of each Contract Year, the parties will discuss in good faith and agree on the Minimum Product Quantities for the successive Contract Year; provided, however, that, if the parties fail to reach agreement on or otherwise specify the Minimum Purchase Quantities for the successive Contract Year, the Minimum Product Quantities for such successive Contract Year shall be __________ percent (___%) of the Minimum Purchase Quantities for the existing Contract Year. \"Contract Year\" means for the first Contract Year of the Agreement, the period commencing on the Effective Date hereof and ending one year thereafter and for subsequent Contract Years, the successive twelve (12) month period thereafter. Failure of Distributor to purchase the Minimum Purchase Quantities for any Contract Year, shall be considered a material breach of this Agreement. 8. Delivery 8.1 Delivery of all Products ordered by Distributor shall be made Ex Works at STAAR's export manufacturing or other facility or named shipping point as determined by STAAR. ICC INCOTERMS (2010 edition) shall apply, except insofar as these INCOTERMS may be inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement. 8.2 In the event Distributor fails to take delivery and/or shipment of Products pursuant to the terms of this Agreement: (a) STAAR shall be entitled to store the Products in a warehouse at the expense and risk of Distributor; (b) the price of the Products shall become immediately due and payable by Distributor; and (c) after thirty (30) days from the date upon which the price becomes payable, STAAR may dispose of the Products in a commercially reasonable manner without notice to Distributor and recover any shortfall and related expenses from Distributor. 8.3 All Products ordered pursuant to accepted purchase orders shall be scheduled for delivery in accordance with STAAR's then current and normal delivery times.\n\n5\n\nSource: STAAR SURGICAL CO, 10-Q, 8/1/2018\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Warranty and Quality Control 9.1 STAAR warrants that, for the period of twelve (12) months from the date of delivery to Distributor hereunder (the \"Warranty Period\"), the Products will meet STAAR's published specifications or labeling for such Products as in effect at the time of such delivery (\"Warranty\"). To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and except as otherwise stated in this Agreement: (a) the foregoing Warranty is exclusive; and (b) all other terms, representations, undertakings, rights, remedies and warranties are excluded, whether express or implied (including but not limited to any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or against infringement). To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the exclusive remedy for breach of the Warranty shall be, at STAAR's option, the repair or replacement, at STAAR's expense, of the non-conforming Product; provided that Distributor notifies STAAR of the non-conformity and returns the non-conforming Product within the Warranty Period. Products may only be returned by Distributor when accompanied by a return material authorization number issued by STAAR. Shipping expenses for Products returned by Distributor will be prepaid by Distributor. STAAR shall pay for the return or replacement shipment to Distributor of Products repaired or replaced under the Warranty. For Products returned for repair or replacement that are not covered under Warranty, STAAR's standard repair charges shall be applicable in addition to all shipping expenses. The above Warranty is contingent upon proper installation, use and maintenance of the Products and does not apply to Products which have been misused, mishandled, adulterated, repaired or modified without STAAR's written approval. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, STAAR shall not be responsible for any incidental or consequential loss, damage, or expense which arises directly or indirectly from the use of any Product. Without limiting the above, and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Distributor's sole remedy in contract or in tort (including in negligence) and STAAR's liability shall be limited to the repair or replacement of any Product which is returned to and found to be defective or non-conforming by STAAR. 9.2 Distributor shall not make any representation or warranty as to the Products except for the warranty stated in Section 9.1 above. Distributor shall not alter the Products and shall not recommend or knowingly sell the Products for any uses except as described in STAAR's Product label and labeling and in accordance with the written instructions and warnings furnished by STAAR. Distributor agrees to deliver to its customers at or before sale all specifications, inserts, instructions, and warnings furnished by STAAR and to retain records evidencing such delivery. 10. Regulatory and Post-Market Surveillance Requirements 10.1 During the term of this Agreement and for at least ten (10) years thereafter, Distributor shall maintain records to allow for traceability of individual serial/lot numbers to customers for all sales of the Products. Upon request by STAAR, Distributor shall supply STAAR with a report of the information contained in such records. 10.2 In the event that STAAR deems it necessary to recall any Product, or any governmental authority requests recall of any Product distributed or sold by Distributor in the Territory, Distributor and STAAR shall cooperate fully with each other in effecting such recall, with an effort to reduce as much as possible the expense thereof and Distributor must notify STAAR of any contemplated or requested recalls as soon as possible (and at all times within any period required to notify any regulatory authority under applicable law) and prior to Distributor taking any steps to effect such a recall. Without limiting Distributor's obligations under law, as between Distributor and STAAR, the decision of whether or not to recall any Product shall be made solely by STAAR. Distributor shall notify all customers who received the recalled Product and shall record all receipts of Product returned under any recall. Distributor shall maintain copies of recall notification letters and maintain distribution logs that detail where each Product was shipped by Distributor.\n\n6\n\nSource: STAAR SURGICAL CO, 10-Q, 8/1/2018\n\n\n\n\n\n10.3 Distributor shall fully document and inform STAAR in writing of any Complaints or other matters addressed in this Section 10.

Distributor will forward to STAAR any Complaint involving significant bodily injury, illness or death resulting from use of Products within one (1) calendar day of receipt and Distributor must notify STAAR of any such incident prior to issuing any notice required by law in respect of such incident (including those to be issued to governmental or regulatory authorities). Distributor shall forward to STAAR all other Complaints within five (5) calendar days of receipt. If any evaluation of Product involved in a Complaint by STAAR is necessary or appropriate, Distributor will use best efforts to retrieve the affected Product, if available, and return it to STAAR. STAAR will pay for the return shipment of such Product to STAAR. STAAR will be responsible for investigating all Complaints, determining if reporting to regulatory authorities in the Territory is required, and submitting such reports to regulatory authorities when required. The term \"Complaints\" as used in this Section 10.3 means any report, complaint or other communication received by Distributor (or its employees, contractors, agents or representatives) from end users of Products or their healthcare providers related to the safety or efficacy of the Products. 10.4 STAAR informs Distributor that Sections 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3 above are requirements of the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC), and that non-compliance by Distributor of these Sections will constitute grounds for STAAR to immediately cease supply of Products to Distributor and will be deemed a failure by Distributor to perform a material obligation, warranty, duty or responsibility hereunder. 10.5 Distributor acknowledges and agrees that it has full understanding of and shall duly observe and abide by any and all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to the import, commercialization, marketing, distribution or sale of Products in the Territory (collectively, \"Regulatory Requirements\"). Distributor further acknowledges and agrees that STAAR does not take any, and shall not be responsible for, any legal liability or responsibility for damages, costs or legal consequences that may result from any failure by Distributor to observe or comply with any Regulatory Requirements. 10.6 Distributor shall observe all transport and storage requirements and conditions applicable to the Products as indicated on any Product packaging. 11.

Distributor agrees that it will have no right or interest in said registrations and applications; that STAAR is and shall remain the exclusive owner of such registrations and applications free and clear of any claims by Distributor; and that Distributor shall make no claim to the same at any time during or after the term of this Agreement. Distributor shall respect such property rights of STAAR and comply with all local laws and regulations in respect thereof. Distributor shall also assist STAAR, at STAAR's request, in taking any steps necessary to defend such rights, and any reasonable expenses incurred in this regard by Distributor shall be reimbursed by STAAR. 11.3 Distributor shall at all times keep STAAR apprised of all Regulatory Requirements and any changes thereto and, on an annual basis, shall report to STAAR in writing of any such changes and confirm in such report that there have been no changes in any Regulatory Requirements other than as specified in the annual report. 11.4 Copies of all permits, licenses, sponsorships and registrations referred in Sections 11.1 and 11.2 shall be promptly forwarded to STAAR. 12. STAAR's Proprietary Information and Rights 12.1 Distributor recognizes and understands that all information not generally known concerning Company and the Products, including but not limited to Company's organization and business affairs, customer lists, sales information, operating procedures and practices, technical data, designs, software, know-how, trade secrets, and processes (the \"Proprietary information\"), whether owned by Company or licensed by Company from third parties, are subject to a valuable proprietary interest of Company, and that Distributor is under an obligation to maintain the confidentiality of such Proprietary Information.

The Software is protected by the U.S. Copyright. Act and by international copyright treaties. All Software, including documentation and any subsequent updates provided by Company to Distributor, is licensed only for use on the single Product on which the Software is first installed. Unauthorized copying of the Software is expressly forbidden, and Distributor agrees not to distribute copies of the Software to nonlicensed parties. In no event shall Distributor reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software.\n\n8\n\nSource: STAAR SURGICAL CO, 10-Q, 8/1/2018\n\n\n\n\n\n12.3 Distributor acknowledges that the Company is the owner and/or licensee in the Territory of the trademark(s) indicated on the Product packaging, advertising or promotional material or utilized in the sale of the Products (the \"Trademarks\").

Thus, Distributor agrees that, in addition to any other remedy it may have, STAAR shall be entitled to enforce the specific performance of the obligations of Distributor under this Section and to seek both temporary and permanent injunctive relief (to the extent permitted by law) without the necessity of proving actual damages. Distributor shall be responsible for any breach of the provisions for this Section by any employee, agent or representative of Distributor. 13.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the exclusive remedy for breach of the Warranty shall be, at STAAR's option, the repair or replacement, at STAAR's expense, of the non-conforming Product; provided that Distributor notifies STAAR of the non-conformity and returns the non-conforming Product within the Warranty Period. Products may only be returned by Distributor when accompanied by a return material authorization number issued by STAAR. Shipping expenses for Products returned by Distributor will be prepaid by Distributor. STAAR shall pay for the return or replacement shipment to Distributor of Products repaired or replaced under the Warranty. For Products returned for repair or replacement that are not covered under Warranty, STAAR's standard repair charges shall be applicable in addition to all shipping expenses. The above Warranty is contingent upon proper installation, use and maintenance of the Products and does not apply to Products which have been misused, mishandled, adulterated, repaired or modified without STAAR's written approval. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, STAAR shall not be responsible for any incidental or consequential loss, damage, or expense which arises directly or indirectly from the use of any Product. Without limiting the above, and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Distributor's sole remedy in contract or in tort (including in negligence) and STAAR's liability shall be limited to the repair or replacement of any Product which is returned to and found to be defective or non-conforming by STAAR. 9.2 Distributor shall not make any representation or warranty as to the Products except for the warranty stated in Section 9.1 above.

Upon request by STAAR, Distributor shall supply STAAR with a report of the information contained in such records. 10.2 In the event that STAAR deems it necessary to recall any Product, or any governmental authority requests recall of any Product distributed or sold by Distributor in the Territory, Distributor and STAAR shall cooperate fully with each other in effecting such recall, with an effort to reduce as much as possible the expense thereof and Distributor must notify STAAR of any contemplated or requested recalls as soon as possible (and at all times within any period required to notify any regulatory authority under applicable law) and prior to Distributor taking any steps to effect such a recall. Without limiting Distributor's obligations under law, as between Distributor and STAAR, the decision of whether or not to recall any Product shall be made solely by STAAR. Distributor shall notify all customers who received the recalled Product and shall record all receipts of Product returned under any recall. Distributor shall maintain copies of recall notification letters and maintain distribution logs that detail where each Product was shipped by Distributor.\n\n6\n\nSource: STAAR SURGICAL CO, 10-Q, 8/1/2018\n\n\n\n\n\n10.3 Distributor shall fully document and inform STAAR in writing of any Complaints or other matters addressed in this Section 10.

Distributor shall respect such property rights of STAAR and comply with all local laws and regulations in respect thereof. Distributor shall also assist STAAR, at STAAR's request, in taking any steps necessary to defend such rights, and any reasonable expenses incurred in this regard by Distributor shall be reimbursed by STAAR. 11.3 Distributor shall at all times keep STAAR apprised of all Regulatory Requirements and any changes thereto and, on an annual basis, shall report to STAAR in writing of any such changes and confirm in such report that there have been no changes in any Regulatory Requirements other than as specified in the annual report. 11.4 Copies of all permits, licenses, sponsorships and registrations referred in Sections 11.1 and 11.2 shall be promptly forwarded to STAAR. 12.

All Software, including documentation and any subsequent updates provided by Company to Distributor, is licensed only for use on the single Product on which the Software is first installed. Unauthorized copying of the Software is expressly forbidden, and Distributor agrees not to distribute copies of the Software to nonlicensed parties. In no event shall Distributor reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software.\n\n8\n\nSource: STAAR SURGICAL CO, 10-Q, 8/1/2018\n\n\n\n\n\n12.3 Distributor acknowledges that the Company is the owner and/or licensee in the Territory of the trademark(s) indicated on the Product packaging, advertising or promotional material or utilized in the sale of the Products (the \"Trademarks\").

Thus, Distributor agrees that, in addition to any other remedy it may have, STAAR shall be entitled to enforce the specific performance of the obligations of Distributor under this Section and to seek both temporary and permanent injunctive relief (to the extent permitted by law) without the necessity of proving actual damages. Distributor shall be responsible for any breach of the provisions for this Section by any employee, agent or representative of Distributor. 13.

LOCATION. During the Term (as defined in Section 6 (a) below), NAI shall      provide the following marketing considerations to Co-Host:\n\n  (a)  Co-Hosting Rights. Co-Host shall be permitted to maintain on the           Online Service Page (as defined in Part 2 of Exhibit \"A\") of the           Originating Locations in the manner set forth on Exhibit \"B\" hereto           (and on such other positions as are set forth on Exhibit \"B\" or as the           parties may mutually agree upon in writing from time to time) a hot           link to Internet locations specified by the Co-Host (the           \"Destination\") from which Goods (other than Competitor's Goods           (hereinafter defined)) may be sold. The web pages at the Destination           shall be maintained in accordance with the requirements of this           Agreement, including without limitation, Section 2 hereof.           \"Competitor's Goods\" as used herein shall mean the Goods of any of the           persons or entities described on Part 1 of Exhibit \"C\" attached hereto           and made a part hereof. The Destination shall not contain any links to           any third party sites for the purchase of Competitor's Goods; provided           that the Destination will link to the Co-Host Site (which will sell           Competitor's Goods).\n\n  (b)  Exclusive Positioning. Co-Host shall be the exclusive reseller of           software products (\"Software\") at the Originating Locations. The           preceding sentence shall not prohibit NAI from (i) reselling Software           including NAI Goods (hereinafter defined) from the McAfee Mall; (ii)           referencing and linking to sites of strategic partners (other than           competitors of Co-Host listed on Part 2 of Exhibit \"C\") which may also           be involved in the resale of Software from such sites; provided that           no Software may be purchased on the page of such site which is linked           to any Originating Location and further provided that the references           and links to the sites of strategic partners shall not be placed on           the Online Service Page; and (iii) advertising Software with banners,           buttons and other forms of online advertising; provided that any link           from such advertising takes the end user to the publisher of the           Software and not a reseller of Goods (other than Co-Host). For           example, an advertising banner or button for the Windows 98 software           program may link back to the website of Microsoft Corporation but not           the website of Dell Computer Corporation which is reselling the           program. Without limitation on the foregoing, NAI may co-host a           comparative shopping service on the Originating Locations. NAI will           obtain a written covenant that the comparative shopping co-host will           present sellers of Software in a neutral manner and upon request of           Co-Host will require removal or alteration of presentations by such           co-host on such co-hosted facility which Co-Host reasonably deems to           be non-neutral; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the           foregoing, Co-Host may be the featured or most prominent Software           reseller on any such service.\n\n  (c)  Short Term Product Exclusives. For a period of fourteen (14) days           following release of any new NAI Goods or major version releases           (i.e., version 3.0 to 4.0) of existing NAI Goods, Co-Host shall be the           exclusive online seller of any such\n\n                                    3    4\n\n       release released during the Term. \"NAI Goods\" as used herein shall           mean retail desktop software products offered by NAI under the           \"McAfee\" brand or other NAI owned brand, which NAI makes available for           resale through distributors and resellers via the Internet.\n\n  (d)  Reference Site. Co-Host may refer to the Originating Locations as a           Co-Host customer location and to NAI as a Co-Host customer hereunder           provided all such references shall be subject to the prior review and           approval of NAI, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld.\n\n  (e)  Links to Online Service Page. Any end user accessing the principal           URLs of NAI (e.g., mcafee.com, cybermedia.com, pgp.com, tis.com) shall           be taken to the Online Service Page. Any end user accessing a \"buy\"           button on any of the Originating Locations shall be taken to the           Online Service Page. NAI shall not sell retail desktop consumer           products, including without limitation, NAI Goods from the NAI           Internet Sites (other than the McAfee Mall).\n\n       NAI reserves the right to change the URL of the Originating Locations           from time to time and agrees to give Co-Host as much notice of any           such change as is practicable.\n\n2.   MARKETING AND SALES.\n\n  (a)  Placement of Order. In consideration of the Co-Hosting Fee set forth           in Part 3 of Exhibit \"A\", NAI shall provide the marketing           consideration identified in Section 1 during the Term of this\n\n\n\n\n\n       Agreement.\n\n  (b)  Advertising Materials; Destination Operation. Co-Host shall provide to           NAI artwork and text materials with respect to the advertisement of           the Destination at the Originating Locations. Such artwork and           materials must be non-infringing, inoffensive, accurate, truthful and           otherwise comply with all applicable laws. Co-Host shall comply with           all applicable laws in connection with the operation of the           Destination, including without limitation, requirements regarding the           confidentiality of information concerning end users. NAI retains the           right, but not the obligation, to disapprove or remove any           advertisements or advertising materials it reasonably deems illegal,           inappropriate or otherwise inconsistent with the purposes of the           Originating Sites, without the consent of Co-Host.\n\n  (c)  Use of Trademarks. Co-Host hereby grants to NAI a non-exclusive,           non-transferable, royalty-free license during the term of this           Agreement to use the trademarks, service marks and trade names of           Co-Host in connection with the advertising and promotion of the Goods           from the Originating Locations, provided that NAI complies with the           terms of Section 9(b) of the Web Site Services Agreement (as defined           below). Co-Host reserves the right to terminate the foregoing right,           after giving NAI notice and opportunity to cure the allegedly harmful           use, if in Co-Host's reasonable judgment, NAI's use of such           trademarks, service marks and trade names harms the business, image or           goodwill of Co-Host.\n\n                                    4    5\n\n  (d)  Limited Duty of Promotion. NAI shall have no duty or obligation to           advertise or promote the Goods, other than as set forth in this           Section 2. Except as expressly set forth herein (including, without           limitation, as set forth in this Section 2(d)), NAI does not,           expressly or impliedly, guaranty or warrant any results or level of           sales or customer leads to Co-Host. NAI reserves the right to cease           publication of the Originating Locations for brief periods from time           to time for maintenance or other purposes; provided that the           Originating Locations will comply with the same \"Uptime Requirements\"           specified with respect to the \"Managed Site\" in the Web Site Services           Agreement.\n\n  (e)  Marketing Promotions. During the Term, Co-Host and NAI will regularly           discuss and implement mutually agreed upon jointly funded marketing           promotions. NAI and Co-Host hereby agree that the marketing promotions           set forth on Exhibit \"D\" hereto will be implemented as set forth on           Exhibit \"D\".\n\n  (f)  Distribution of Physical Products. NAI grants to Co-Host the right to           distribute physical copies of NAI's Goods to end users ordering from           the Managed Site, the Destination or Beyond.com upon the terms set           forth in Exhibit \"E\" attached hereto and made a part hereof.\n\n3.   PAYMENT AND RECORDS.\n\n  (a)  Fees. Subject to the provisions of Section 6 hereof, Co-Host shall pay           to NAI the amount designated in Part 3 of Exhibit \"A\" as the           Co-Hosting Fee upon the schedule set forth in such Part.\n\n  (b)  Payment Terms. Except as set forth in such Part 3 of Exhibit \"A\",           payments from Co-Host to NAI shall be due thirty (30) days from the           date of invoice. All payments will be made in United States dollars,           free of any taxes then currently applicable, at the address designated           above by NAI. Late payments shall bear interest at the lesser of: (i)           the maximum rate permitted by law, and (ii) the rate of 1.5% per month           from the due date until paid.\n\n4.   EQUITABLE RELIEF. Each party acknowledges that any breach of its      obligations under this Agreement with respect to the proprietary rights or      confidential information of the other party will cause the other party      irreparable injury for which there are inadequate remedies at law, and      therefore such other party will be entitled to equitable relief in addition      to all other remedies provided by this Agreement or available at law.\n\n5.   PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. NAI retains ownership of the NAI Internet Site, the      Originating Locations, the trademarks and all intellectual property rights      in connection with the NAI Internet Site, including without limitation, its      URL designations and all rights from InterNIC in connection therewith.      Co-Host and its licensors retain ownership of all intellectual property      rights in the advertising materials provided, the trademarks and all      intellectual property rights in connection with the Destination and the      Co-Host Site, including, without limitation, its URL designations and all      rights from InterNIC in connection therewith, and all of its other      intellectual property rights.\n\n                                    5    6\n\n6.   TERM AND TERMINATION.\n\n  (a)  Term. This Agreement will commence on the Effective Date, and will           terminate on the third anniversary of the Effective Date (the \"Term\"),           unless earlier terminated as provided in this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n  (b)  Termination. A party may terminate this Agreement immediately: (i) if           the other party engages in any material unlawful business practice and           such practice continues uncured thirty (30) days following written           notice thereof, (ii) if the other party fails to perform any material           obligation, (which shall include, without limitation, the payment           obligations hereunder and compliance with the Uptime Requirements in           respect of the Originating Locations) or violates any material           restriction contained in this Agreement and such failure continues           uncured thirty (30) days following written notice thereof, (iii) by           such party if that certain Web Site Services Agreement between NAI and           Co-Host dated of even date herewith (the \"Web Site Services           Agreement\") or the ESD Agreement is terminated by the other party,           (iv) if a receiver is appointed for the other party or its property,           (v) if the other party makes an assignment for the benefit of           creditors, (vi) if the other party becomes the subject of any           proceeding under any bankruptcy, insolvency or debtor's relief law,           (vii) upon ninety (90) days prior notice in writing by Co-Host at any           time after June 30, 2000, if the term of the Web Site Services           Agreement has not been renewed for an additional term of one (1) year           or more pursuant to its terms or (viii) if the party terminates the           Web Site Services Agreement by reason of the other party's material           default thereunder.\n\n  (c)  Effect of Termination. Upon the effective date of the termination, all           outstanding invoices and other invoicable amounts will become due and           payable. Co-Host's contractual right to the marketing consideration           shall cease immediately upon the effective date of the termination.           Termination or expiration of this Agreement if by reason of material           breach by Co-Host shall not affect any of Co-Host's payment           obligations, all of which survive termination of this Agreement;           provided that, in (i) the event of termination of this Agreement by           Co-Host due to a material default by NAI, NAI shall pay to the Co-Host           the Liquidated Damages Amount (as defined in Part 2 of Exhibit \"A\").\n\n7.   CONFIDENTIALITY. Confidential Information disclosed by either party in      writing and marked as \"confidential,\" proprietary\" or the like (or      disclosed verbally if a written summary is provided within thirty days),      including any information relating to such party's research, development,      proprietary technology, product and marketing plans, finances, personnel      and business opportunities will be considered confidential information.      Each party will not use the other party's confidential information except      as required to achieve the objectives of this Agreement and will not      disclose such confidential information except to employees, agents and      contractors who have a need to know in the discharge of their duties under      this Agreement. Such restrictions will not apply to information that      becomes public knowledge other than through the disclosing party, is      independently developed by the non-disclosing party, or is lawfully      required to be disclosed by any governmental agency or otherwise required      to be disclosed by law.\n\n                                    6    7\n\n  Neither party will make any disclosure of, or statement covering, the terms      of this Agreement, including the financial terms, to any third parties      (other than its attorneys, accountants and professional consultants),      without obtaining the other's prior written consent, except as required by      court order or applicable regulatory authorities, including without      limitation, the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange      Commission, any stock exchange and the NASDAQ. The parties agree that under      their current understanding, disclosure of the financial terms of this      Agreement is not required under the foregoing rules and regulations. The      obligations of this Section 7 shall survive the termination of this      Agreement, under any circumstances. The parties shall make a joint press      release announcing the relationship, the timing and content of which shall      be subject to the mutual agreement of the parties.\n\n8.   RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES. The parties are independent contractors and      not partners, joint venturers or agents, and neither party may obligate the      other to any warranty or other obligation. Neither NAI nor Co-Host is by      virtue of this Agreement authorized as an agent or other representative of      the other party.\n\n9.   REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND INDEMNIFICATION.\n\n  (a)  Co-Host represents and warrants to NAI that Co-Host has all right,           title, ownership interest and/or marketing rights necessary to provide           the advertising materials to NAI, to perform its obligations hereunder           and to operate the Destination. Each party further represents and           warrants to the other that it has not entered into any agreements or           commitments which are inconsistent with or in conflict with the rights           granted or obligations incurred by the representing party in this           Agreement. Co-Host further represents and warrants that the           advertising materials supplied hereunder do not infringe any Covered           Country (hereinafter defined) copyright, trademark, or trade secret           right. Covered Country shall mean the United States of America and any           member state of the European Economic Union. Co-Host agrees that, if           notified promptly in writing and given sole control of the defense and           all related settlement negotiations, it will defend NAI, its           employees, officers and agents, against any claim based on an           allegation that (i) advertising materials supplied hereunder infringes           a Covered Country patent, copyright, trademark or state trade secret           right, or (ii) Co-Host violated any law, statute or ordinance or any           governmental or administrative order, rule or regulation with regard\n\n\n\n\n\n       to the advertising materials, the operation of the Destination or the           manufacture, possession, distribution, use or sale of the Goods.           Co-Host will pay any resulting costs, damages and attorneys' fees           finally awarded by a court, or agreed to in settlement by Co-Host,           with respect to any such claims. NAI agrees that, if the advertising           materials become, or in Co-Host's opinion are likely to become, the           subject of an infringement claim, NAI will permit Co-Host, at           Co-Host's option and expense, to, among other things, procure the           right for NAI to continue marketing and using the advertising           materials, or to replace or modify them so that they become           non-infringing.\n\n                                    7    8\n\n  (b)  NAI represents and warrants that NAI has all right, title, ownership           interest and/or marketing rights necessary to operate the Originating           Locations, provide the Products to Co-Host, and the Products shall be           free and clear of all liens and encumbrances. NAI further represents           and warrants that it has not entered into any agreements or           commitments which are inconsistent with or in conflict with the rights           granted to Co-Host in this Agreement. NAI further represents and           warrants that the Products supplied hereunder do not infringe any           Covered Country patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret right.           NAI agrees that, if notified promptly in writing and given sole           control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations, it           will defend Co-Host, its employees, officers and agents against any           claim based on an allegation that (i) a Product supplied hereunder           infringes a Covered Country patent, copyright, trademark or trade           secret right, or (ii) NAI violated any law, statute or ordinance or           any governmental or administrative order, rule or regulation with           regard to a Product or its manufacturer, possession, use or sale. NAI           will pay any resulting costs, damages and attorneys' fees finally           awarded by a court, or agreed to in settlement by NAI, with respect to           any such claims to the extent of the compensation received under this           Agreement. Co-Host agrees that, if the Products in the inventory of           Co-Host, or the operation thereof, become, or in NAI's opinion are           likely to become, the subject of an infringement claim, Co-Host will           permit NAI, at NAI's option and expense, to, among other things,           procure the right for Co-Host to continue marketing and using such           Products, or to replace or modify them so that they become           non-infringing. If neither of the foregoing alternatives is available           on terms that NAI deems reasonable, Co-Host will return such Products           on written request from NAI. NAI will grant Co-Host a credit equal to           the price paid by Co-Host for such returned Products, as adjusted for           discounts, returns and credits actually given, provided that such           returned Products are in an undamaged condition.

FORCE MAJEURE.

APPOINTMENT. NAI appoints Co-Host as a non-exclusive distributor of the      Products to end users ordering the Products from the Destination or the      Co-Host Site, and Co-Host accepts this appointment. Co-Host shall      distribute the Products, as an independent reseller, at its own risk and      expense and subject to any such prices, contractual terms and conditions as      Co-Host may from time to time determine. Nothing in this Agreement shall      prohibit Co-Host from distributing competing products in the Territory. The      \"Territory\" as that term is used herein shall mean all countries in the      world except countries to which export or re-export of any Product, or the      direct products of any Product is prohibited by United States law without      first obtaining the permission of the United States Office of Export      Administration or its successor. Co-Host shall not have the right to assign      or otherwise transfer this Agreement or any rights herein granted to any      other person or entity, except by operation of law or in connection with      the sale of all of its assets, or the acquisition of the Co-Host by a third      party. Any such attempted assignment shall be void and the Agreement shall      remain in effect.\n\n2.   DISTRIBUTION. Co-Host has the right to market and distribute the Products      subject to the license agreement that accompanies such Product. Co-Host may\n\n\n\n\n\n  not engage in the rental of any of the Products. Co-Host shall not in any      event remove from or obscure upon any Products any labels placed thereon by      NAI containing statements of restrictions upon distribution, without the      prior written consent of NAI. NAI reserves the right in its sole discretion      and without liability to Co-Host to add additional Products, change the      prices for the Products pursuant to Section 5, modify the Products, change      the level of NAI's support for the Products and discontinue the      availability of any Product. Any addition or deletion from the list of      Products will be indicated by NAI's revision to the NAI price list, and NAI      will use reasonable efforts to provide Co-Host with thirty (30) days notice      prior to the effective date of such changes indicated on the NAI price      list.\n\n                                    2    17\n\n3.   MARKETING.\n\n  (a)  General. Co-Host will use commercially reasonable efforts to market           the Products it orders to the best of its ability, and to that end           will (i) conduct marketing activities authorized by NAI, (ii) support           special promotions initiated by NAI, and (iii) maintain a sound           financial condition. Co-Host will conduct its business in a manner           that reflects favorably upon the Products and NAI.\n\n  (b)  Advertising; Use of Trademarks. Co-Host may advertise and promote the           Products in a commercially reasonable manner and, subject to the           provisions of Section 5 of the Co-Hosting Agreement, may use           trademarks, service marks and trade names provided by NAI in           connection therewith, provided that all such promotions and           advertising will be consistent with NAI's general quality standards           and the provisions of Section 5 of the Co-Hosting Agreement. Unless           otherwise agreed upon in writing by NAI, Co-Host will submit each           advertisement and promotion to NAI for trademark review and approval           prior to initial release, which approval will not be unreasonably           delayed or withheld. All such usage which was not expressly approved           by NAI must be terminated immediately upon receipt of notice from NAI           to that effect.\n\n  (c)  Trademarks Rights. NAI owns any and all trademarks, trade names, and           service marks for the Products (as noted in Section 5 of the           Co-Hosting Agreement). Such trademarks, trade names, and service marks           shall include all product names, the names \"Network Associates,\"           logos, designs, and other designations or brands used by NAI in           connection with the Products. Co-Host acknowledges and agrees that NAI           is not granting to Co-Host any rights in any Product trademark, trade           name, or service mark in or outside of the Territory.\n\n4.   INSPECTIONS, RECORDS AND REPORTING.\n\n  (a)  Sales Out Reports. Co-Host will provide to NAI within ten (10) days           after the end of each calendar month, a computer media data file in           the format established by NAI showing, for such month, Co-Host's total           sales, by customer and by Product from each location. If requested by           NAI, Co-Host shall provide such reports with respect to weekly periods           or bi-weekly periods prior to the end of the calendar month in which           such period occurs.\n\n  (b)  Inventory Level Reports. Co-Host will provide to NAI on Monday of each           week, a computer media data file in the format established by NAI           showing Co-Host's current inventory levels of each Product (including           items in transit), and weekly runrate snapshots and the other           information reasonably requested by NAI.\n\n  (c)  Records. For three (3) years after each calendar quarter during the           term of this Agreement, Co-Host will keep, at Co-Host's office, full           and accurate books of account and copies of all documents and other           materials for such quarter relating to this Agreement and Co-Host's           records, accounts and contracts relating to the distribution of the           Products.\n\n                                    3    18\n\n  (d)  Audit. NAI may inspect the records described in Sections 4(c) upon           demand from time to time. In addition, Co-Host agrees to allow NAI's           independent auditors to audit and analyze appropriate accounting           records of Co-Host from time to time (but not more than one every six           (6) months) to ensure compliance with all terms of this Agreement. Any           such audit shall be permitted by Co-Host within fifteen (15) days of           Co-Host's receipt of NAI's written request to audit, during normal           business hours. The cost of such an audit will be borne by NAI unless           a material discrepancy indicating inadequate record keeping or that           additional fees due to NAI are discovered, in which case the cost of           the audit shall be borne by Co-Host. A discrepancy shall be deemed           material if it involves payment or adjustment of more than five           percent of the amount reported in favor of NAI. Audits and inspections           shall not interfere unreasonably with Co-Host's business activities.]\n\n5.   ORDERING AND PAYMENT.\n\n  (a)  NAI's Acceptance. Any order for delivery of physical product placed\n\n\n\n\n\n       with NAI is subject to acceptance by NAI within ten (10) days           following receipt by NAI. NAI may decline any order, in whole or in           part, and unless NAI accepts an order in writing, the order is           considered accepted only to the extent it is fulfilled.] The terms and           conditions of this Agreement and of the applicable NAI invoice or           confirmation will apply to each order accepted or shipped by NAI.           Electronic confirmation from an authorized NAI email address shall           have the same effect as a signed written confirmation. The provisions           of Co-Host's form of purchase order or other business forms will not           apply to any order notwithstanding NAI's acknowledgment or acceptance           of such order.\n\n  (b)  Price to Co-Host. NAI will inform Co-Host as to its current suggested           retail price of the Products and standard discount or pricing granted           to NAI's traditional product distributors. During the term of this           Agreement, Co-Host will be invoiced on the basis of the discounts set           forth on Exhibit \"A\" of this Distribution Addendum. Discounts off           suggested retail price (SRP) for standard NAI Products shall exclude           tradeups, upgrade SKUs and special promotions, unless otherwise           indicated. NAI may change its SRP from time to time upon written           notice to Co-Host, which may take the form of a revised price list,           and NAI may notify Co-Host of a different discount from SRP in the           event NAI offers special promotional SRPs or Product prices in NAI's           discretion.\n\n  (c)  Price Increase. If NAI increases its suggested retail price for any           Product (a product upgrade with a different part number will not be           the same Product) and there is a resulting increase in the price of           Products to Co-Host, NAI will give Co-Host thirty (30) days advance           notice of the effective date of any such increase and:\n\n       (i)  NAI will honor the old price for any shipments of such Product                already in transit to Co-Host;\n\n                                    4    19\n\n       (ii) All additional orders following such thirty (30) day period will                be shipped at the new price;\n\n      (iii) NAI has orders for such Product from Co-Host already booked into                NAI's order entry system at the time of such price increase or if                Co-Host orders additional Products during such thirty (30) day                period, then the price increase will not apply to that portion of                such orders which call for shipments of not more than the monthly                average quantity of such Products shipped to Co-Host in the three                month period preceding the date of the increase; and\n\n       (iv) Orders for such Product in NAI's order entry system in excess of                the quantity specified in (iii) above will be shipped at the new                price unless they are canceled by Co-Host by written notice to                NAI, provided that such notice is received by NAI no later than                fifteen (15) days prior to the date of shipment specified in such                order.\n\n  (d)  Price Decrease. If NAI decreases its suggested retail price for any           Product (a product upgrade with a different part number will not be           the same Product), the decrease will apply to all units of such           Product in Co-Host's inventory and orders in transit to Co-Host from           NAI that are in an unopened, salable condition as of the effective           date of the decrease, provided that such Products had been shipped to           Co-Host no more than ninety (90) days prior to such effective date. To           be eligible for such price protection, Co-Host must deliver to NAI           written evidence, signed by Co-Host, of an inventory of such Products           showing the number and location of each unit of Product for which           Co-Host claims price protection eligibility hereunder within thirty           (30) days of receiving notice of such price decreases. Such reduction           will constitute a credit on Co-Host's account for future orders from           NAI under this Agreement (unless the Agreement has terminated or           expired in which case such reduction will be refunded to the extent           that Co-Host does not owe NAI money) in an amount equal to the           difference between the net invoice price at which each such unit in           inventory was provided to Co-Host and the current price then           applicable for shipments of such Product to Co-Host hereunder.\n\n  (e)  TAXES.\n\n       (i)  All amounts payable by Co-Host to NAI under this Agreement are                exclusive of any tax, withholding tax, levy, or similar                governmental charge that may be assessed by any jurisdiction in                or outside the Territory except income and similar taxes levied                on and payable by NAI. Such taxes, withholding taxes, levies, and                governmental charges (collectively \"Taxes\") include Taxes based                on sales, use, excise, import or export values/fees, value-added,                income, revenue, net worth, or may be the result of the delivery,                possession, or use of the Products, the execution or performance                of this Agreement or otherwise. Should any Taxes be due, Co-Host                agrees to pay such Taxes and indemnify NAI for any claim for\n\n                                    5    20\n\n\n\n\n\n            such Taxes demanded. Co-Host shall make no deduction from any                amounts owed to NAI for any Taxes. Co-Host covenants to NAI that                all Products distributed hereunder will be in the ordinary course                of Co-Host's business, and Co-Host agrees to provide NAI with                appropriate information and/or documentation satisfactory to the                applicable taxing authorities to substantiate any claim of                exemption from any Taxes.\n\n       (ii) For all Taxes paid by Co-Host, Co-Host shall provide to NAI                within forty-five (45) days after the end of any quarter, a                certificate of tax payment documenting the payment and amount of                the Taxes paid during the preceding quarter.\n\n6.

All shipments           will be made using either any carrier approved by both Co-Host and           NAI. Co-Host will not without NAI's prior written consent, submit any           order calling for the shipment of a Product to more than a single           redistribution site.\n\n  (b)  Risk of Loss. All risk of loss of or damage to the Products will pass           to Co-Host upon delivery by NAI to the common carrier. Co-Host will           bear the risk of loss or damage in transit.\n\n  (c)  Partial Delivery. Unless Co-Host clearly advises NAI to the contrary           in writing NAI, may make partial shipments on account of Co-Host's           orders which shall, to be separately invoiced and paid for when due.\n\n7.

The preceding sentence governs whether or not           NAI is obligated to issue an RMA under this Agreement or applicable           law. RMAs must be in writing, signed by NAI and only authorize the           return of Products in good resalable conditions unless expressly           provided otherwise herein. If damaged goods are received pursuant to           an RMA, no credit shall be given by NAI with respect to such damaged           goods unless the RMA indicates otherwise. Co-Host shall be responsible           for all freight charges for goods returned pursuant to an RMA, unless           otherwise indicated herein or in the RMA.\n\n  (b)  Customer Returns and Bad Box. Subject to Section 7 (a), Co-Host may,           during the term of this Agreement, obtain a credit against current or           future invoices from\n\n                                    6    21\n\n       NAI, for Products which have been returned by end users as defective,           or pursuant to the warranty stated in NAI's end user license. Such           credit will be in an amount equal to the original invoice price less           any discounts or other credits previously received. Co-Host shall also           have the ability to return for credit Products which have boxes that           are or become damaged, unless such damage was caused by Co-Host. An           offsetting purchase order must be placed for all bad box returns. In           the event of claims by end users of incomplete Product, NAI, at its           discretion, may supply to Co-Host, at no charge, any and all missing           materials which are supposed to be provided with the current release           of such Products or replace the entire Products in such situation.\n\n  (c)  Discontinued Products. Co-Host may, during the term of this Agreement,           obtain a credit for the price paid by Co-Host to be applied against           current or future invoices, for all versions of Products shipped by           NAI within the previous ninety (90) days that NAI discontinues or           which are removed from NAI's current retail price list. Such credit           will be equal to the price paid by Co-Host for such obsolete Products,           less discounts received under Section 5 of this Agreements. All such           discontinued Products will be counted and inspected at the Inspection           Site by NAI's employee, and upon NAI's acceptance thereof (which will           be a condition of Co-Host's eligibility for a credit hereunder) such           Products will be promptly and completely destroyed or, if requested by           NAI, such Products or any portion thereof will be returned to NAI as           it directs. No Product shall be deemed discontinued if a later version           of the Product is still being offered by NAI and end users may obtain           the current version of such Product from NAI electronically at no           additional charge.\n\n  (d)  Freight. Co-Host will pay all costs (including freight) associated           with the return of the Products to NAI and back to Co-Host as provided           herein, except that NAI will be responsible for all freight costs           associated with (i) the return of Products under Section 7(b), (ii)           the return of any discontinued or obsolete Products under Section           7(c), and (iii) the return of other Product updates agreed upon by NAI           and Co-Host.\n\n8.   GENERAL.\n\n\n\n\n\n  (a)  Co-Host agrees that it will not, directly or indirectly, export or           transmit the Product and technical data (or any part thereof) or any           process or service that is the direct product of the software and           documentation, to any group S or Z country specified in Supplement No.           1 of Section 770 of the Export Administration Regulations or to any           other country to which such export or transmission is restricted by           such regulation or statute, without the prior written consent, if           required, of the Office of Export Administration of the U.S.           Department of Commerce, or such other governmental entity as may have           jurisdiction over such export or transmission.\n\n                                    7    22\n\n  (b)  Co-Host acknowledges that some NAI Products hereto contain encryption           and some are export restricted (the \"Restricted Software\") by the U.S.           Department of Commerce's Bureau of Export Administration (BXA).           Co-Host further acknowledges that for this reason, the export of such           items may subject the Co-Host or its executives to fines and/or other           severe penalties. Unless all required permits and/or approvals have           been obtained, Co-Host shall not export or re-export the Restricted           Software outside of the United States, whether directly or indirectly,           and will not cause, approve or otherwise facilitate others such as           agents, subsequent purchasers, licensees or any other third parties in           doing so. The parties agree to cooperate with each other with respect           to any application for any required licenses and approvals. However,           Co-Host acknowledges it is their ultimate responsibility to comply           with all export laws with respect to the Restricted Software and that           NAI has no further responsibility after the initial sale to the           Co-Host within the United States.\n\n                                    8    23\n\n                        EXHIBIT \"A\" TO EXHIBIT \"E\"\n\n1.

Agency shall refrain from admitting or denying                   liability on the part of the company in connection with any                   claim or lawsuit.\n\n         5.

If this agreement is terminated, MICOA shall, at the Agency's                   request, provide the Agency with a list of existing                   MICOA-billed policies placed by the Agency including their                   expiration dates.\n\n         5.       The Agency's name shall appear on all policies, premium                   notices, and cancellation notices to policyholders. Copies of                   all such items sent to policyholders shall be provided by                   MICOA to the Agency.\n\nC.

EXPIRATIONS\n\n         1.       In the event this Agreement is terminated for any reason,                   MICOA agrees to purchase from Agency, and Agency agrees to                   sell to MICOA Agency's ownership interest in the expirations                   for the MICOA insurance issued pursuant to this Agreement. The                   purchase price shall be two times Agency's commissions on                   business produced directly by Agency during the last 12 full                   months preceding the termination date. The purchase shall be                   completed within 60 calendar days after the termination date.                   In return for this payment, for a two-year period following                   the termination date, Agency will not directly or indirectly                   sell any professional liability insurance to any individuals                   or entities who were MICOA insureds in Nevada at the time of                   termination of this Agreement.\n\n         2.       If Agency enters into a subagency agreement under which the                   subagency has the right to retain ownership of expirations on                   business produced by the subagency, then the purchase of                   expirations under subparagraph 1 above will not include the                   purchase of those subagency expirations, and the purchase                   price paid to Agency will not include the commissions paid for                   such business produced by the subagency.\n\n                                      -3-\n\nE.

The Agency shall provide MICOA a          copy of each policy; doing so on a regular and current basis shall be a          precondition to all of Agency's rights under this Agreement, including          but not limited to the payment of all earned commissions.\n\nF.       TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT\n\n         1.       This agreement shall terminate:\n\n                  a.       Automatically if any public authority cancels or                            declines to renew the Agency's license or Certificate                            of Authority.\n\n                  b.       Immediately if either party gives detailed written                            notice to the other of alleged gross and willful                            misconduct, fraud or material misrepresentation.\n\n         2.       This Agreement shall terminate, subject to any automatic                   renewal or extension for one year as required by law, upon                   either party giving at least one hundred twenty (120) days                   advance written notice to the other, if not otherwise contrary                   to applicable law or this Agreement.\n\n         3.       If the Agency is delinquent in either accounting or payment of\n\n\n\n\n\n                  monies due MICOA, MICOA may by written notice to the Agency                   immediately terminate, suspend or modify any of the provisions                   of this agreement. Such action shall not be taken by MICOA                   over minor differences between the records of the Agency and                   MICOA.\n\n         4.       All supplies, including forms and policies furnished by MICOA                   and any copies or other reproductions of them, shall remain                   the property of MICOA and shall be returned to MICOA or its                   representative upon demand.\n\nG.

MICOA shall indemnify and hold Agency harmless against any                   MICOA act or omission, except to the extent the Agency has                   caused, compounded, or contributed to such error.\n\n         2.       Agency shall indemnify and hold Agency harmless against any                   act or omission of the Agency, except to the extent MICOA has                   caused, compounded, or contributed to such error.\n\n         3.       The Agency and MICOA shall properly notify one another upon                   receiving notice of the commencement of any action related to                   such liabilities.

Neither party shall, except at its own risk and expense,                   voluntarily assume any liability, make any payment or incur                   any expense without the prior written consent of the other.\n\nH.       POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES\n\n         1.       Other Programs. Agency and MICOA agree that Agency may be                   offered the opportunity to support MICOA's workers'                   compensation, and its other nonphysician professional                   liability or product programs in Nevada when MICOA proceeds                   with related marketing plans. Such plans may also include                   Agency's involvement in sales of MICOA commercial and personal                   products. Appropriate agreements must be negotiated separately                   from this agreement for each such product, and for each such                   territory, including but not limited to Nevada.\n\n         2.

There are other agreements between MICOA and                   the Agency's parent corporation, SC&W, which are not                   superceded.\n\n         4. &bbsp;     Independent Contractor.

Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be interpreted under the                   laws of the State of Nevada.

Counterparts. This Agreement and any Exhibits which require                   signatures may be executed in counterparts which shall\n\n\n\n\n\n                  together be regarded as binding upon the Parties.\n\n         7.

If the two arbitrators cannot agree on                            the selection of a third, American Arbitration                            Association's regional office closest to Agency's                            main office shall be requested to appoint the third                            arbitrator.\n\n                  b.

The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with                            the procedures of the above referenced regional                            office of the American Arbitration Association. The                            Agency and MICOA shall pay the cost of their                            arbitrator and share equally in the expense of the                            third arbitrator.\n\n                  e.       Either Party, may where permitted by the law of                            Nevada, enter judgment upon the arbitrators' award.\n\n         10.      Year 2000 Compliance.

Hagadorn East Lansing, MI 48823\n\nRE:      NEVADA DEPARTMENT          PROJECT MEMORANDUM\n\nDear Terry:\n\nIn response to MICOA's request to develop a complete insurance distribution system for Nevada, including physicians professional liability and personal and commercial insurance by July 1999, Stratton, Cheeseman & Walsh, Inc. (SC&W) has spent and will continue to spend a substantial amount of time and money. In recognition that these expenditures will directly benefit MICOA, SC&W and MICOA agree to the following:\n\n-    During the first two years of developing the Nevada distribution system, a      portion of the start up costs will be shared. Subject to compliance with a      detailed budget developed by SC&W and MICOA, these reimbursable costs shall      include:\n\n     -    Salaries and benefits for SCW-Nevada, Inc. employees and agents.\n\n     -    20% of your total personal benefits and salary, and 100% of your           personal travel expenses incurred with respect to the Nevada office,           which respective percentages are intended to recognize your personal           support of MICOA's Nevada initiative.\n\n     -    Legal expenses directly attributable to the Nevada initiative.\n\n     -    Nevada office set up.\n\n     -    Consultant's expenses paid by SC&W in direct support of the           initiative.\n\n     -    The above costs are to be designated and itemized in the preapproved           budget and reimbursed by MICOA at 100% for the first full year of           development and 50% for the second year. It is agreed that the first           year began effective October 1, 1997.\n\n-    All other costs attributable to the normal operation of the Nevada      insurance agency site are the sole responsibility of SC&W.\n\n-    After the first two years (i.e. after October 1, 1999) all expenses will      be borne by SC&W and those amounts paid to SC&W during the first two years      shall be repaid. Repayment shall be through reduction of commissions due      SC&W by 0.5% or if\n\n                                      -7-\n\n     SC&W exceeds $10.0 million in premium revenues by offset in the event any      money is owed the Agency by MICOA. Such reduction or offset shall occur for      so long as necessary to repay amounts reimbursed by MICOA during the      two-year period of development; but in no event will repayment be collected      for a period of greater than ten years. Any unpaid amounts at the end of      ten years shall be forgiven by MICOA.\n\n-    Nevada rent expenses will be shared on a 50/50 basis between MICOA and      SC&W.\n\n-    In order to allow SC&W to expand the distribution system in Nevada with      select and controlled subagents, an exclusive agency agreement will be      negotiated which will spell out the terms and conditions of the      relationship. A commission rate of 12% will be paid for both new and      renewal physicians liability business. Other commission rates will be      determined as products become available. This Agency Agreement should be      finalized by April 30, 1999.\n\n-    MICOA may pay future payments advanced pursuant to this letter on a monthly      basis, unless doing so would be impractical, in which case another periodic      form of&bbsp;payment will be arranged. Amounts owed for past time periods will      be paid as follows: one-third by March 25, 1999; one-third by May 1, 1999;      and one-third by June 1, 1999. All other amounts owed under this Project      Memorandum to be paid by October 1, 1999.\n\nSC&W's responsibilities, under this Project Memorandum, will include assisting MICOA with market assessment, distribution, and sales integration into Nevada. SC&W agrees not to serve in a strategic marketing capacity for another insurer\n\n\n\n\n\nin Nevada while it is providing such services for MICOA or for a period of one year thereafter.\n\nTerry, please countersign and return this letter to indicate your acceptance.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMUTUAL INSURANCE CORPORATION OF AMERICA\n\n/s/ Thomas C.

Commissions on premiums shall be paid to the Agency within 30                   business days of the month in which such premiums are received                   and recorded by MICOA, subject to deduction by MICOA of any                   return commissions due from the Agency.\n\n         3.       Except as provided in Section D or unless authorized by the                   Agency, MICOA or its affiliates shall not use its records of                   business placed by the Agency with MICOA to solicit individual                   policyholders for the sale of other lines of\n\n                                      -2-\n\n                  insurance or other products or services. When the Agency                   grants such authorization, Agency shall be paid the applicable                   commission on such sales, provided an appropriate agreement is                   in place with MICOA.\n\n         4.       If this agreement is terminated, MICOA shall, at the Agency's                   request, provide the Agency with a list of existing                   MICOA-billed policies placed by the Agency including their                   expiration dates.\n\n         5.       The Agency's name shall appear on all policies, premium                   notices, and cancellation notices to policyholders. Copies of                   all such items sent to policyholders shall be provided by                   MICOA to the Agency.\n\nC.       POLICY CANCELLATION\n\n         Cancellation of any policy in force, when requested in writing by the          insured, will be honored by MICOA, except for those MICOA is not          otherwise permitted to cancel.\n\nD.       EXPIRATIONS\n\n         1.       In the event this Agreement is terminated for any reason,                   MICOA agrees to purchase from Agency, and Agency agrees to                   sell to MICOA Agency's ownership interest in the expirations                   for the MICOA insurance issued pursuant to this Agreement. The                   purchase price shall be two times Agency's commissions on                   business produced directly by Agency during the last 12 full                   months preceding the termination date. The purchase shall be                   completed within 60 calendar days after the termination date.                   In return for this payment, for a two-year period following                   the termination date, Agency will not directly or indirectly                   sell any professional liability insurance to any individuals                   or entities who were MICOA insureds in Nevada at the time of                   termination of this Agreement.\n\n         2.       If Agency enters into a subagency agreement under which the                   subagency has the right to retain ownership of expirations on                   business produced by the subagency, then the purchase of                   expirations under subparagraph 1 above will not include the                   purchase of those subagency expirations, and the purchase                   price paid to Agency will not include the commissions paid for                   such business produced by the subagency.\n\n                                      -3-\n\nE.       AGENCY'S ERRORS AND OMISSION, AND FIDELITY & ELECTRONIC CRIME INSURANCE\n\n         The Agency will maintain valid errors and omissions insurance, with          minimum limits of $1,000,000 per incident, and a fidelity and          electronic crime policy through an insurer, both of which shall contain          terms and limits of coverage acceptable to MICOA covering the Agency's          solicitors and each of its employees. The Agency shall provide MICOA a          copy of each policy; doing so on a regular and current basis shall be a          precondition to all of Agency's rights under this Agreement, including          but not limited to the payment of all earned commissions.\n\nF.       TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT\n\n         1.       This agreement shall terminate:\n\n                  a.       Automatically if any public authority cancels or                            declines to renew the Agency's license or Certificate                            of Authority.\n\n                  b.       Immediately if either party gives detailed written                            notice to the other of alleged gross and willful                            misconduct, fraud or material misrepresentation.\n\n         2.       This Agreement shall terminate, subject to any automatic                   renewal or extension for one year as required by law, upon                   either party giving at least one hundred twenty (120) days                   advance written notice to the other, if not otherwise contrary                   to applicable law or this Agreement.\n\n         3.       If the Agency is delinquent in either accounting or payment of\n\n\n\n\n\n                  monies due MICOA, MICOA may by written notice to the Agency                   immediately terminate, suspend or modify any of the provisions                   of this agreement. Such action shall not be taken by MICOA                   over minor differences between the records of the Agency and                   MICOA.\n\n         4.       All supplies, including forms and policies furnished by MICOA                   and any copies or other reproductions of them, shall remain                   the property of MICOA and shall be returned to MICOA or its                   representative upon demand.\n\nG.       INDEMNIFICATION\n\n         The respective parties shall indemnify and hold one another harmless as          follows:\n\n                                      -4-\n\n         1.       MICOA shall indemnify and hold Agency harmless against any                   MICOA act or omission, except to the extent the Agency has                   caused, compounded, or contributed to such error.\n\n         2.       Agency shall indemnify and hold Agency harmless against any                   act or omission of the Agency, except to the extent MICOA has                   caused, compounded, or contributed to such error.\n\n         3.       The Agency and MICOA shall properly notify one another upon                   receiving notice of the commencement of any action related to                   such liabilities. MICOA shall be entitled to participate in                   any such action or in consultation with Agency and its carrier                   to assume the defense of any such action. If MICOA assumes the                   defense of any such action, it shall not be liable to the                   Agency for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred                   on the Agency's behalf absent MICOA's advance approval of such                   expenses.\n\n         4.       Neither party shall, except at its own risk and expense,                   voluntarily assume any liability, make any payment or incur                   any expense without the prior written consent of the other.\n\nH.       POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES\n\n         1.       Other Programs. Agency and MICOA agree that Agency may be                   offered the opportunity to support MICOA's workers'                   compensation, and its other nonphysician professional                   liability or product programs in Nevada when MICOA proceeds                   with related marketing plans. Such plans may also include                   Agency's involvement in sales of MICOA commercial and personal                   products. Appropriate agreements must be negotiated separately                   from this agreement for each such product, and for each such                   territory, including but not limited to Nevada.\n\n         2.       Territory. Agency and MICOA further agree to consider, subject                   to successful negotiation of appropriate agreements separate                   from this agreement, expansion of Agencies' sales territories                   for MICOA beyond Nevada.\n\nI.       MISCELLANEOUS\n\n         1.       Amendment. This agreement may be amended only in writing by                   mutual agreement of the Agency and MICOA, except that MICOA's                   name herein shall be deemed changed automatically for purposes                   of this agreement without written amendment upon approval of                   any such change by MICOA's domiciliary regulator.\n\n         2.       Non Waiver. Any failure by MICOA to insist upon compliance                   with any provisions of this Agreement or of the rules and                   regulations of MICOA shall not be construed as or constitute a                   waiver of them by MICOA.\n\n                                      -5-\n\n         3.       Integrated Agreement. This Agreement and its attachments as                   modified from time to time supersedes and replaces as of its                   effective date, all previous agreements, if any, between MICOA                   and the Agency. There are other agreements between MICOA and                   the Agency's parent corporation, SC&W, which are not                   superceded.\n\n         4. &bbsp;     Independent Contractor. The Agency is an independent insurance                   Agency and independent contractor, and not an employee,                   manager, officer or owner of MICOA.\n\n         5.       Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be interpreted under the                   laws of the State of Nevada. Any provisions of this Agreement                   or any amendments to the Agreement that are or become in                   conflict with any applicable statutes or regulations shall be                   deemed to be amended to conform to those statutes or                   regulations.\n\n         6.       Counterparts. This Agreement and any Exhibits which require                   signatures may be executed in counterparts which shall\n\n\n\n\n\n                  together be regarded as binding upon the Parties.\n\n         7.       Authority. The persons signing below represent and warrant                   that they are duly authorized representatives of the                   respective Parties, fully willing and able to execute this                   Agreement.\n\n         8.       Assignment. MICOA may assign this Agreement to its parent,                   affiliate, or subsidiary corporations who are licensed                   insurers upon written notice to Agency. Agency may not assign                   this Agreement without the written permission of MICOA or its                   successors or assigns.\n\n         9.       Resolution of Disputes. In the event of any dispute arising                   out of this Agreement, MICOA and Agency agree to submit such                   dispute to arbitration as follows:\n\n                  a.       There shall be three arbitrators; one shall be                            selected by the Agency, one shall be selected by                            MICOA, and a third shall be selected by those two                            arbitrators. If the two arbitrators cannot agree on                            the selection of a third, American Arbitration                            Association's regional office closest to Agency's                            main office shall be requested to appoint the third                            arbitrator.\n\n                  b.       The determination of the arbitrators shall be final                            and binding upon the Agency and MICOA.\n\n                  c.       Neither MICOA nor the Agency shall be entitled to                            punitive and/or exemplary damages.\n\n                                      -6-\n\n                  d.       The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with                            the procedures of the above referenced regional                            office of the American Arbitration Association. The                            Agency and MICOA shall pay the cost of their                            arbitrator and share equally in the expense of the                            third arbitrator.\n\n                  e.       Either Party, may where permitted by the law of                            Nevada, enter judgment upon the arbitrators' award.\n\n         10.      Year 2000 Compliance. Agency must at times assure that any of                   its computers, data processing systems, software components,                   and network arrangements use for MICOA business completely and                   accurately, present, produce, store and calculate all dates                   after December 31, 1999; and that they will not produce                   abnormally ending or incorrect results involving such dates as                   used in any forward or regression data based functions. All                   such items must yield date-related functionalities and date                   fields which accurately indicate the century and millennium                   and correctly perform all calculations involving a four digit                   year field.\n\nSigned and effective this 25th day of May, 1999.\n\n                                         AGENCY\n\n                                         By:  /s/ Terrence L.

Hagadorn East Lansing, MI 48823\n\nRE:      NEVADA DEPARTMENT          PROJECT MEMORANDUM\n\nDear Terry:\n\nIn response to MICOA's request to develop a complete insurance distribution system for Nevada, including physicians professional liability and personal and commercial insurance by July 1999, Stratton, Cheeseman & Walsh, Inc. (SC&W) has spent and will continue to spend a substantial amount of time and money. In recognition that these expenditures will directly benefit MICOA, SC&W and MICOA agree to the following:\n\n-    During the first two years of developing the Nevada distribution system, a      portion of the start up costs will be shared. Subject to compliance with a      detailed budget developed by SC&W and MICOA, these reimbursable costs shall      include:\n\n     -    Salaries and benefits for SCW-Nevada, Inc. employees and agents.\n\n     -    20% of your total personal benefits and salary, and 100% of your           personal travel expenses incurred with respect to the Nevada office,           which respective percentages are intended to recognize your personal           support of MICOA's Nevada initiative.\n\n     -    Legal expenses directly attributable to the Nevada initiative.\n\n     -    Nevada office set up.\n\n     -    Consultant's expenses paid by SC&W in direct support of the           initiative.\n\n     -    The above costs are to be designated and itemized in the preapproved           budget and reimbursed by MICOA at 100% for the first full year of           development and 50% for the second year. It is agreed that the first           year began effective October 1, 1997.\n\n-    All other costs attributable to the normal operation of the Nevada      insurance agency site are the sole responsibility of SC&W.\n\n-    After the first two years (i.e. after October 1, 1999) all expenses will      be borne by SC&W and those amounts paid to SC&W during the first two years      shall be repaid. Repayment shall be through reduction of commissions due      SC&W by 0.5% or if\n\n                                      -7-\n\n     SC&W exceeds $10.0 million in premium revenues by offset in the event any      money is owed the Agency by MICOA. Such reduction or offset shall occur for      so long as necessary to repay amounts reimbursed by MICOA during the      two-year period of development; but in no event will repayment be collected      for a period of greater than ten years. Any unpaid amounts at the end of      ten years shall be forgiven by MICOA.\n\n-    Nevada rent expenses will be shared on a 50/50 basis between MICOA and      SC&W.\n\n-    In order to allow SC&W to expand the distribution system in Nevada with      select and controlled subagents, an exclusive agency agreement will be      negotiated which will spell out the terms and conditions of the      relationship. A commission rate of 12% will be paid for both new and      renewal physicians liability business. Other commission rates will be      determined as products become available. This Agency Agreement should be      finalized by April 30, 1999.\n\n-    MICOA may pay future payments advanced pursuant to this letter on a monthly      basis, unless doing so would be impractical, in which case another periodic      form of&bbsp;payment will be arranged. Amounts owed for past time periods will      be paid as follows: one-third by March 25, 1999; one-third by May 1, 1999;      and one-third by June 1, 1999. All other amounts owed under this Project      Memorandum to be paid by October 1, 1999.\n\nSC&W's responsibilities, under this Project Memorandum, will include assisting MICOA with market assessment, distribution, and sales integration into Nevada. SC&W agrees not to serve in a strategic marketing capacity for another insurer\n\n\n\n\n\nin Nevada while it is providing such services for MICOA or for a period of one year thereafter.\n\nTerry, please countersign and return this letter to indicate your acceptance.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMUTUAL INSURANCE CORPORATION OF AMERICA\n\n/s/ Thomas C.

All payments hereunder shall be payable in U.S. Dollars. All payments owed under this Agreement shall be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to a bank and account designated in writing by Xencor, unless otherwise specified in writing by Xencor.\n\n8.3 Taxes.\n\n8.3.1 The Parties acknowledge and agree that it is their mutual objective and intent to minimize, to the extent feasible, taxes payable with respect to their collaborative efforts under this Agreement to cooperate and coordinate with each other to achieve such objective.

Each Party shall cooperate with the other Party in any way reasonably requested by the other Party to minimize the withholding tax implications of any such assignment or delegation.\n\n8.3.3 Aimmune shall be responsible for all Value Added Taxes (\"VAT\"), if any, attributable to transactions contemplated by this Agreement without any offset or reimbursement from Xencor.

Within [***] ([***]) days after delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If a Party believes that a Claim presented to it for indemnification is one as to which the Party seeking indemnification is not entitled to indemnification under, as applicable, Section 11.1 or Section 11.2, it shall so notify the Party seeking indemnification.\n\n11.3.2 If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of such Claim, the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at its own expense; provided, that if the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes, based on advice from counsel, that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests with respect to such Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party solely in connection therewith.\n\n11.3.3 The Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Party advised of the status of such Claim and the defense thereof and shall consider recommendations made by the Indemnified Party with respect thereto. 35\n\nSource: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 2/5/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3.4 The Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of such Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, OR ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF ANY NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Aimmune shall provide Xencor with written notice at least [***] ([***]) days prior to the cancellation, nonrenewal or material change in such insurance or self-insurance which materially adversely affects the rights of Xencor hereunder.\n\nARTICLE 12 CONFIDENTIALITY\n\n12.1 Confidential Information.\n\n12.1.1 The Parties agree that during the Term, and for a period of [***] ([***]) years thereafter, a Party receiving Confidential Information of the other Party will (X) maintain in confidence such Confidential Information to the same extent such Party maintains its own proprietary information of similar kind and value, and, in any event, no less than a reasonable standard of care, (Y) not disclose such Confidential Information to any Third Party without the prior written consent of the other Party, except as otherwise expressly permitted below, and (Z) not use such Confidential Information for any purpose except those permitted by this Agreement. 36\n\nSource: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 2/5/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nAs used herein, \"Confidential Information\" means all Know-How and other information and materials received by either Party from the other Party or its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement.

Where reasonably possible, the receiving Party shall notify the disclosing Party of the receiving Party's intent to make such disclosure of Confidential Information pursuant to the preceding sentence sufficiently prior to making such disclosure so as to allow the disclosing Party adequate time to take whatever action the disclosing Party may deem to be appropriate to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information.\n\n12.1.3 Except as set forth above, each Party agrees that it shall provide or permit access to Confidential Information of the other Party only to (i) the receiving Party's attorneys, independent accountants and financial advisors for the sole purpose of enabling such attorneys, independent accountants and financial advisors to provide advice to the receiving Party and (ii) the receiving Party's Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors, actual or potential acquirers and permitted subcontractors, sublicensees and subdistributors, and to the directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors and permitted subcontractors, actual or potential acquirers, sublicensees and subdistributors of such Affiliates, who have a need to know such Confidential Information to assist the receiving Party with the 37\n\nSource: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 2/5/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nactivities contemplated or required of it by this Agreement; provided that in each case the Person to whom Confidential Information is being disclosed is subject to obligations of confidentiality and non-use with respect to such Confidential Information substantially similar to the obligations of confidentiality and nonuse of the receiving Party pursuant to this Section 12.1; and provided further, that each Party shall remain responsible for any failure by its attorneys, independent accountants and financial advisors, Affiliates, and its and its Affiliates' respective directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors, actual or potential acquirers and permitted subcontractors, sublicensees and subdistributors, to treat such Confidential Information as required under this Section 12.1.\n\nFor clarity, either Party may disclose without any limitation such Party's U.S. federal income tax treatment and the U.S. federal income tax structure of the transactions relating to such Party that are based on or derived from this Agreement, as well as all materials of any kind (including opinions, other tax analyses, or a complete copy of this Agreement and any amendments thereto) relating to such tax treatment or tax structure, except to the extent that nondisclosure of such matters is reasonably necessary in order to comply with applicable securities laws.\n\n12.1.4 Each Party acknowledges that a Party in breach of any of its obligations under this Section 12.1 shall cause the non-breaching Party irreparable harm, for which monetary damages will be an inadequate remedy. Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement in the event of any such breach, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy available to it under this Agreement, at law or in equity, to injunctive relief, including an accounting for profits, specific performance of the terms hereof and other equitable relief for such breach, without the posting of bond or other security.\n\n12.2 Publicity.

Subject to the foregoing, any press releases or other public statements or disclosures regarding the subject matter of this Agreement shall be subject to the express prior written consent of each of the Parties; provided that a disclosure shall be permitted without the other Party's consent to the extent that it does not contain information beyond that included in a prior disclosure approved in writing by both Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing any disclosure which is required by Applicable Law or the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or any securities exchange, as reasonably advised by the disclosing Party's counsel, may be made without the prior consent of the other Party, although, prior to any such legally required disclosure by a Party, such Party shall use reasonable efforts where practicable to give the other Party reasonable notice and an opportunity to comment on the proposed disclosure.\n\n12.3 Securities Filings.

Except for disclosures permitted under this Agreement, if Xencor, its Affiliates, or its employee(s) or consultant(s) wishes to make a publication or presentation specific to the Product or which otherwise may reasonably contain Know-How, or other intellectual property, of Aimmune, Xencor must receive written approval, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, from Aimmune at least [***] ([***]) days prior to submission for publication or presentation.

Each Party shall have a response plan in place for any disclosure of Confidential Information that is not authorized or otherwise permitted under this Agreement. Such plan shall include considerations of, among other things, notification, remediation and retrieval. In the event that a Party becomes aware of an unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information, then such Party shall notify the other Party promptly in writing.\n\n12.7 Prior CDA. As of the Effective Date, the terms of this ARTICLE 12 shall supersede any prior non-disclosure, secrecy or confidentiality agreement between the Parties (or their Affiliates) dealing with the subject of this Agreement, including the Confidentiality Agreement between the Parties dated [***].

The Breaching Party shall have sixty (60) days (thirty (30) days in the event of non-payment) after written notice thereof was provided to the Breaching Party by the non-breaching Party to remedy such default. Unless the Breaching Party has cured any such breach or default prior to the expiration of such sixty (60) day period (thirty (30) day period for non-payment), such termination shall become effective upon receipt of the written notice of termination by the Breaching Party to be given within ten (10) days of the end of such sixty (60) day period (thirty (30) day period for non-payment).

(Nasdaq: AIMT), a biopharmaceutical company developing treatments for potentially life-threatening food allergies, today announced it has obtained an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize the investigational humanized monoclonal antibody XmAb\u00ae7195 from Xencor, Inc.\n\nXmAb7195, which has been renamed AIMab7195, was originally developed by Xencor for the treatment of allergic asthma. It uses three distinct mechanisms of action to reduce blood serum IgE and suppress IgE-producing cells. Aimmune initially plans to develop AIMab7195 as an adjunctive treatment with select Characterized Oral Desensitized ImmunoTherapy (CODIT\u2122) programs, including PALFORZIA\u2122 , to explore treatment outcomes in patients with food allergies.\n\n\"As we look to the future of food allergy treatments, we are excited to explore the potential of oral immunotherapy to achieve greater levels of desensitization - and perhaps even remission - when combined with adjunctive biologics that target immune pathways,\" said Jayson Dallas, M.D., President and CEO of Aimmune. \"In-licensing AIMab7195 demonstrates our commitment to enriching our pipeline and strengthening Aimmune's global leadership in the evolving therapeutic landscape of food allergy treatments.\"\n\n\"Aimmune's focus, clinical success and regulatory expertise in food allergy demonstrate their capability to advance AIMab7195 with highly complementary CODIT pipeline programs to create new options for people living with food allergy,\" said Bassil Dahiyat, Ph.D., President and CEO of Xencor. \"AIMab7195 is designed to reduce levels of IgE, a key mediator of allergic response, and there is strong scientific rationale that this reduction would synergize with the activity of desensitization therapies.\"\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Aimmune will make an upfront payment to Xencor of $5 million in cash and $5 million in equity, equivalent to 156,238 newly issued shares of Aimmune common stock at $32.0025/share. Xencor also is eligible to receive up to $385 million based on the achievement of certain clinical development, regulatory and commercialization milestones \u2014 beginning with the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial \u2014 and is eligible to receive a high single-digit to mid-teen percentage of royalties upon commercialization of AIMab7195. Aimmune will be solely responsible for costs related to the development of AIMab7195 and plans to provide a development plan in the coming months.\n\nAbout AIMab7195 (formerly XmAb\u00ae7195)\n\nAIMab7195 is an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody with enhanced binding to the Fc gamma receptor IIb (FcyRIIb). IgE recognizes and interacts with allergens and, as a result, can activate immune cells, such as mast cells and basophils, that drive an allergic response\n\nSource: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 2/5/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nin patients. AIMab7195 is designed to clear IgE rapidly from circulation, to prevent the production of IgE by preventing the activation of IgE-positive B cells, and to block IgE from interacting with its receptor on immune cells. AIMab7195 has been evaluated in two Phase 1 studies that enrolled more than 100 healthy volunteers and patients with allergy and atopic disease.\n\nAbout Aimmune\n\nAimmune Therapeutics, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company that aspires to become the global leader in developing curative therapies and solutions for patients with food allergies. With a mission to improve the lives of people with food allergies, Aimmune is developing and commercializing oral treatments for potentially life-threatening food allergies. The Company's Characterized Oral Desensitization ImmunoTherapy (CODIT\u2122) approach is intended to provide meaningful levels of protection against allergic reactions resulting from accidental exposure to food allergens by desensitizing patients with defined, precise amounts of key allergens. Aimmune has one FDA-approved medicine for peanut allergy and other investigational therapies in development to treat other food allergies.

All payments hereunder shall be payable in U.S. Dollars. All payments owed under this Agreement shall be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to a bank and account designated in writing by Xencor, unless otherwise specified in writing by Xencor.\n\n8.3 Taxes.\n\n8.3.1 The Parties acknowledge and agree that it is their mutual objective and intent to minimize, to the extent feasible, taxes payable with respect to their collaborative efforts under this Agreement to cooperate and coordinate with each other to achieve such objective.

Each Party shall cooperate with the other Party in any way reasonably requested by the other Party to minimize the withholding tax implications of any such assignment or delegation.\n\n8.3.3 Aimmune shall be responsible for all Value Added Taxes (\"VAT\"), if any, attributable to transactions contemplated by this Agreement without any offset or reimbursement from Xencor.

Within [***] ([***]) days after delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If a Party believes that a Claim presented to it for indemnification is one as to which the Party seeking indemnification is not entitled to indemnification under, as applicable, Section 11.1 or Section 11.2, it shall so notify the Party seeking indemnification.\n\n11.3.2 If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of such Claim, the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at its own expense; provided, that if the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes, based on advice from counsel, that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests with respect to such Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party solely in connection therewith.\n\n11.3.3 The Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Party advised of the status of such Claim and the defense thereof and shall consider recommendations made by the Indemnified Party with respect thereto. 35\n\nSource: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 2/5/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3.4 The Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of such Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, OR ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF ANY NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Aimmune shall provide Xencor with written notice at least [***] ([***]) days prior to the cancellation, nonrenewal or material change in such insurance or self-insurance which materially adversely affects the rights of Xencor hereunder.\n\nARTICLE 12 CONFIDENTIALITY\n\n12.1 Confidential Information.\n\n12.1.1 The Parties agree that during the Term, and for a period of [***] ([***]) years thereafter, a Party receiving Confidential Information of the other Party will (X) maintain in confidence such Confidential Information to the same extent such Party maintains its own proprietary information of similar kind and value, and, in any event, no less than a reasonable standard of care, (Y) not disclose such Confidential Information to any Third Party without the prior written consent of the other Party, except as otherwise expressly permitted below, and (Z) not use such Confidential Information for any purpose except those permitted by this Agreement. 36\n\nSource: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 2/5/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nAs used herein, \"Confidential Information\" means all Know-How and other information and materials received by either Party from the other Party or its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement.

Where reasonably possible, the receiving Party shall notify the disclosing Party of the receiving Party's intent to make such disclosure of Confidential Information pursuant to the preceding sentence sufficiently prior to making such disclosure so as to allow the disclosing Party adequate time to take whatever action the disclosing Party may deem to be appropriate to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information.\n\n12.1.3 Except as set forth above, each Party agrees that it shall provide or permit access to Confidential Information of the other Party only to (i) the receiving Party's attorneys, independent accountants and financial advisors for the sole purpose of enabling such attorneys, independent accountants and financial advisors to provide advice to the receiving Party and (ii) the receiving Party's Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors, actual or potential acquirers and permitted subcontractors, sublicensees and subdistributors, and to the directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors and permitted subcontractors, actual or potential acquirers, sublicensees and subdistributors of such Affiliates, who have a need to know such Confidential Information to assist the receiving Party with the 37\n\nSource: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 2/5/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nactivities contemplated or required of it by this Agreement; provided that in each case the Person to whom Confidential Information is being disclosed is subject to obligations of confidentiality and non-use with respect to such Confidential Information substantially similar to the obligations of confidentiality and nonuse of the receiving Party pursuant to this Section 12.1; and provided further, that each Party shall remain responsible for any failure by its attorneys, independent accountants and financial advisors, Affiliates, and its and its Affiliates' respective directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors, actual or potential acquirers and permitted subcontractors, sublicensees and subdistributors, to treat such Confidential Information as required under this Section 12.1.\n\nFor clarity, either Party may disclose without any limitation such Party's U.S. federal income tax treatment and the U.S. federal income tax structure of the transactions relating to such Party that are based on or derived from this Agreement, as well as all materials of any kind (including opinions, other tax analyses, or a complete copy of this Agreement and any amendments thereto) relating to such tax treatment or tax structure, except to the extent that nondisclosure of such matters is reasonably necessary in order to comply with applicable securities laws.\n\n12.1.4 Each Party acknowledges that a Party in breach of any of its obligations under this Section 12.1 shall cause the non-breaching Party irreparable harm, for which monetary damages will be an inadequate remedy. Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement in the event of any such breach, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy available to it under this Agreement, at law or in equity, to injunctive relief, including an accounting for profits, specific performance of the terms hereof and other equitable relief for such breach, without the posting of bond or other security.\n\n12.2 Publicity.

Subject to the foregoing, any press releases or other public statements or disclosures regarding the subject matter of this Agreement shall be subject to the express prior written consent of each of the Parties; provided that a disclosure shall be permitted without the other Party's consent to the extent that it does not contain information beyond that included in a prior disclosure approved in writing by both Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing any disclosure which is required by Applicable Law or the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or any securities exchange, as reasonably advised by the disclosing Party's counsel, may be made without the prior consent of the other Party, although, prior to any such legally required disclosure by a Party, such Party shall use reasonable efforts where practicable to give the other Party reasonable notice and an opportunity to comment on the proposed disclosure.\n\n12.3 Securities Filings.

Except for disclosures permitted under this Agreement, if Xencor, its Affiliates, or its employee(s) or consultant(s) wishes to make a publication or presentation specific to the Product or which otherwise may reasonably contain Know-How, or other intellectual property, of Aimmune, Xencor must receive written approval, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, from Aimmune at least [***] ([***]) days prior to submission for publication or presentation.

Each Party shall have a response plan in place for any disclosure of Confidential Information that is not authorized or otherwise permitted under this Agreement. Such plan shall include considerations of, among other things, notification, remediation and retrieval. In the event that a Party becomes aware of an unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information, then such Party shall notify the other Party promptly in writing.\n\n12.7 Prior CDA. As of the Effective Date, the terms of this ARTICLE 12 shall supersede any prior non-disclosure, secrecy or confidentiality agreement between the Parties (or their Affiliates) dealing with the subject of this Agreement, including the Confidentiality Agreement between the Parties dated [***].

The Breaching Party shall have sixty (60) days (thirty (30) days in the event of non-payment) after written notice thereof was provided to the Breaching Party by the non-breaching Party to remedy such default. Unless the Breaching Party has cured any such breach or default prior to the expiration of such sixty (60) day period (thirty (30) day period for non-payment), such termination shall become effective upon receipt of the written notice of termination by the Breaching Party to be given within ten (10) days of the end of such sixty (60) day period (thirty (30) day period for non-payment).

(Nasdaq: AIMT), a biopharmaceutical company developing treatments for potentially life-threatening food allergies, today announced it has obtained an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize the investigational humanized monoclonal antibody XmAb\u00ae7195 from Xencor, Inc.\n\nXmAb7195, which has been renamed AIMab7195, was originally developed by Xencor for the treatment of allergic asthma. It uses three distinct mechanisms of action to reduce blood serum IgE and suppress IgE-producing cells. Aimmune initially plans to develop AIMab7195 as an adjunctive treatment with select Characterized Oral Desensitized ImmunoTherapy (CODIT\u2122) programs, including PALFORZIA\u2122 , to explore treatment outcomes in patients with food allergies.\n\n\"As we look to the future of food allergy treatments, we are excited to explore the potential of oral immunotherapy to achieve greater levels of desensitization - and perhaps even remission - when combined with adjunctive biologics that target immune pathways,\" said Jayson Dallas, M.D., President and CEO of Aimmune. \"In-licensing AIMab7195 demonstrates our commitment to enriching our pipeline and strengthening Aimmune's global leadership in the evolving therapeutic landscape of food allergy treatments.\"\n\n\"Aimmune's focus, clinical success and regulatory expertise in food allergy demonstrate their capability to advance AIMab7195 with highly complementary CODIT pipeline programs to create new options for people living with food allergy,\" said Bassil Dahiyat, Ph.D., President and CEO of Xencor. \"AIMab7195 is designed to reduce levels of IgE, a key mediator of allergic response, and there is strong scientific rationale that this reduction would synergize with the activity of desensitization therapies.\"\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Aimmune will make an upfront payment to Xencor of $5 million in cash and $5 million in equity, equivalent to 156,238 newly issued shares of Aimmune common stock at $32.0025/share. Xencor also is eligible to receive up to $385 million based on the achievement of certain clinical development, regulatory and commercialization milestones \u2014 beginning with the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial \u2014 and is eligible to receive a high single-digit to mid-teen percentage of royalties upon commercialization of AIMab7195. Aimmune will be solely responsible for costs related to the development of AIMab7195 and plans to provide a development plan in the coming months.\n\nAbout AIMab7195 (formerly XmAb\u00ae7195)\n\nAIMab7195 is an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody with enhanced binding to the Fc gamma receptor IIb (FcyRIIb). IgE recognizes and interacts with allergens and, as a result, can activate immune cells, such as mast cells and basophils, that drive an allergic response\n\nSource: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 2/5/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nin patients. AIMab7195 is designed to clear IgE rapidly from circulation, to prevent the production of IgE by preventing the activation of IgE-positive B cells, and to block IgE from interacting with its receptor on immune cells. AIMab7195 has been evaluated in two Phase 1 studies that enrolled more than 100 healthy volunteers and patients with allergy and atopic disease.\n\nAbout Aimmune\n\nAimmune Therapeutics, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company that aspires to become the global leader in developing curative therapies and solutions for patients with food allergies. With a mission to improve the lives of people with food allergies, Aimmune is developing and commercializing oral treatments for potentially life-threatening food allergies. The Company's Characterized Oral Desensitization ImmunoTherapy (CODIT\u2122) approach is intended to provide meaningful levels of protection against allergic reactions resulting from accidental exposure to food allergens by desensitizing patients with defined, precise amounts of key allergens. Aimmune has one FDA-approved medicine for peanut allergy and other investigational therapies in development to treat other food allergies.

All payments hereunder shall be payable in U.S. Dollars. All payments owed under this Agreement shall be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to a bank and account designated in writing by Xencor, unless otherwise specified in writing by Xencor.\n\n8.3 Taxes.\n\n8.3.1 The Parties acknowledge and agree that it is their mutual objective and intent to minimize, to the extent feasible, taxes payable with respect to their collaborative efforts under this Agreement to cooperate and coordinate with each other to achieve such objective.

Each Party shall cooperate with the other Party in any way reasonably requested by the other Party to minimize the withholding tax implications of any such assignment or delegation.\n\n8.3.3 Aimmune shall be responsible for all Value Added Taxes (\"VAT\"), if any, attributable to transactions contemplated by this Agreement without any offset or reimbursement from Xencor.

Within [***] ([***]) days after delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If a Party believes that a Claim presented to it for indemnification is one as to which the Party seeking indemnification is not entitled to indemnification under, as applicable, Section 11.1 or Section 11.2, it shall so notify the Party seeking indemnification.\n\n11.3.2 If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of such Claim, the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at its own expense; provided, that if the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes, based on advice from counsel, that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests with respect to such Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party solely in connection therewith.\n\n11.3.3 The Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Party advised of the status of such Claim and the defense thereof and shall consider recommendations made by the Indemnified Party with respect thereto. 35\n\nSource: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 2/5/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3.4 The Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of such Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, OR ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF ANY NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Aimmune shall provide Xencor with written notice at least [***] ([***]) days prior to the cancellation, nonrenewal or material change in such insurance or self-insurance which materially adversely affects the rights of Xencor hereunder.\n\nARTICLE 12 CONFIDENTIALITY\n\n12.1 Confidential Information.\n\n12.1.1 The Parties agree that during the Term, and for a period of [***] ([***]) years thereafter, a Party receiving Confidential Information of the other Party will (X) maintain in confidence such Confidential Information to the same extent such Party maintains its own proprietary information of similar kind and value, and, in any event, no less than a reasonable standard of care, (Y) not disclose such Confidential Information to any Third Party without the prior written consent of the other Party, except as otherwise expressly permitted below, and (Z) not use such Confidential Information for any purpose except those permitted by this Agreement. 36\n\nSource: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 2/5/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nAs used herein, \"Confidential Information\" means all Know-How and other information and materials received by either Party from the other Party or its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement.

Where reasonably possible, the receiving Party shall notify the disclosing Party of the receiving Party's intent to make such disclosure of Confidential Information pursuant to the preceding sentence sufficiently prior to making such disclosure so as to allow the disclosing Party adequate time to take whatever action the disclosing Party may deem to be appropriate to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information.\n\n12.1.3 Except as set forth above, each Party agrees that it shall provide or permit access to Confidential Information of the other Party only to (i) the receiving Party's attorneys, independent accountants and financial advisors for the sole purpose of enabling such attorneys, independent accountants and financial advisors to provide advice to the receiving Party and (ii) the receiving Party's Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors, actual or potential acquirers and permitted subcontractors, sublicensees and subdistributors, and to the directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors and permitted subcontractors, actual or potential acquirers, sublicensees and subdistributors of such Affiliates, who have a need to know such Confidential Information to assist the receiving Party with the 37\n\nSource: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 2/5/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nactivities contemplated or required of it by this Agreement; provided that in each case the Person to whom Confidential Information is being disclosed is subject to obligations of confidentiality and non-use with respect to such Confidential Information substantially similar to the obligations of confidentiality and nonuse of the receiving Party pursuant to this Section 12.1; and provided further, that each Party shall remain responsible for any failure by its attorneys, independent accountants and financial advisors, Affiliates, and its and its Affiliates' respective directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisors, actual or potential acquirers and permitted subcontractors, sublicensees and subdistributors, to treat such Confidential Information as required under this Section 12.1.\n\nFor clarity, either Party may disclose without any limitation such Party's U.S. federal income tax treatment and the U.S. federal income tax structure of the transactions relating to such Party that are based on or derived from this Agreement, as well as all materials of any kind (including opinions, other tax analyses, or a complete copy of this Agreement and any amendments thereto) relating to such tax treatment or tax structure, except to the extent that nondisclosure of such matters is reasonably necessary in order to comply with applicable securities laws.\n\n12.1.4 Each Party acknowledges that a Party in breach of any of its obligations under this Section 12.1 shall cause the non-breaching Party irreparable harm, for which monetary damages will be an inadequate remedy. Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement in the event of any such breach, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy available to it under this Agreement, at law or in equity, to injunctive relief, including an accounting for profits, specific performance of the terms hereof and other equitable relief for such breach, without the posting of bond or other security.\n\n12.2 Publicity.

Subject to the foregoing, any press releases or other public statements or disclosures regarding the subject matter of this Agreement shall be subject to the express prior written consent of each of the Parties; provided that a disclosure shall be permitted without the other Party's consent to the extent that it does not contain information beyond that included in a prior disclosure approved in writing by both Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing any disclosure which is required by Applicable Law or the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or any securities exchange, as reasonably advised by the disclosing Party's counsel, may be made without the prior consent of the other Party, although, prior to any such legally required disclosure by a Party, such Party shall use reasonable efforts where practicable to give the other Party reasonable notice and an opportunity to comment on the proposed disclosure.\n\n12.3 Securities Filings.

Except for disclosures permitted under this Agreement, if Xencor, its Affiliates, or its employee(s) or consultant(s) wishes to make a publication or presentation specific to the Product or which otherwise may reasonably contain Know-How, or other intellectual property, of Aimmune, Xencor must receive written approval, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, from Aimmune at least [***] ([***]) days prior to submission for publication or presentation.

Each Party shall have a response plan in place for any disclosure of Confidential Information that is not authorized or otherwise permitted under this Agreement. Such plan shall include considerations of, among other things, notification, remediation and retrieval. In the event that a Party becomes aware of an unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information, then such Party shall notify the other Party promptly in writing.\n\n12.7 Prior CDA. As of the Effective Date, the terms of this ARTICLE 12 shall supersede any prior non-disclosure, secrecy or confidentiality agreement between the Parties (or their Affiliates) dealing with the subject of this Agreement, including the Confidentiality Agreement between the Parties dated [***].

The Breaching Party shall have sixty (60) days (thirty (30) days in the event of non-payment) after written notice thereof was provided to the Breaching Party by the non-breaching Party to remedy such default. Unless the Breaching Party has cured any such breach or default prior to the expiration of such sixty (60) day period (thirty (30) day period for non-payment), such termination shall become effective upon receipt of the written notice of termination by the Breaching Party to be given within ten (10) days of the end of such sixty (60) day period (thirty (30) day period for non-payment).

(Nasdaq: AIMT), a biopharmaceutical company developing treatments for potentially life-threatening food allergies, today announced it has obtained an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize the investigational humanized monoclonal antibody XmAb\u00ae7195 from Xencor, Inc.\n\nXmAb7195, which has been renamed AIMab7195, was originally developed by Xencor for the treatment of allergic asthma. It uses three distinct mechanisms of action to reduce blood serum IgE and suppress IgE-producing cells. Aimmune initially plans to develop AIMab7195 as an adjunctive treatment with select Characterized Oral Desensitized ImmunoTherapy (CODIT\u2122) programs, including PALFORZIA\u2122 , to explore treatment outcomes in patients with food allergies.\n\n\"As we look to the future of food allergy treatments, we are excited to explore the potential of oral immunotherapy to achieve greater levels of desensitization - and perhaps even remission - when combined with adjunctive biologics that target immune pathways,\" said Jayson Dallas, M.D., President and CEO of Aimmune. \"In-licensing AIMab7195 demonstrates our commitment to enriching our pipeline and strengthening Aimmune's global leadership in the evolving therapeutic landscape of food allergy treatments.\"\n\n\"Aimmune's focus, clinical success and regulatory expertise in food allergy demonstrate their capability to advance AIMab7195 with highly complementary CODIT pipeline programs to create new options for people living with food allergy,\" said Bassil Dahiyat, Ph.D., President and CEO of Xencor. \"AIMab7195 is designed to reduce levels of IgE, a key mediator of allergic response, and there is strong scientific rationale that this reduction would synergize with the activity of desensitization therapies.\"\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Aimmune will make an upfront payment to Xencor of $5 million in cash and $5 million in equity, equivalent to 156,238 newly issued shares of Aimmune common stock at $32.0025/share. Xencor also is eligible to receive up to $385 million based on the achievement of certain clinical development, regulatory and commercialization milestones \u2014 beginning with the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial \u2014 and is eligible to receive a high single-digit to mid-teen percentage of royalties upon commercialization of AIMab7195. Aimmune will be solely responsible for costs related to the development of AIMab7195 and plans to provide a development plan in the coming months.\n\nAbout AIMab7195 (formerly XmAb\u00ae7195)\n\nAIMab7195 is an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody with enhanced binding to the Fc gamma receptor IIb (FcyRIIb). IgE recognizes and interacts with allergens and, as a result, can activate immune cells, such as mast cells and basophils, that drive an allergic response\n\nSource: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 2/5/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nin patients. AIMab7195 is designed to clear IgE rapidly from circulation, to prevent the production of IgE by preventing the activation of IgE-positive B cells, and to block IgE from interacting with its receptor on immune cells. AIMab7195 has been evaluated in two Phase 1 studies that enrolled more than 100 healthy volunteers and patients with allergy and atopic disease.\n\nAbout Aimmune\n\nAimmune Therapeutics, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company that aspires to become the global leader in developing curative therapies and solutions for patients with food allergies. With a mission to improve the lives of people with food allergies, Aimmune is developing and commercializing oral treatments for potentially life-threatening food allergies. The Company's Characterized Oral Desensitization ImmunoTherapy (CODIT\u2122) approach is intended to provide meaningful levels of protection against allergic reactions resulting from accidental exposure to food allergens by desensitizing patients with defined, precise amounts of key allergens. Aimmune has one FDA-approved medicine for peanut allergy and other investigational therapies in development to treat other food allergies.

HealthGate shall carry out the Development Work in accordance with             the Development Timetable and in accordance with the Specification             by the System Completion Date.\n\n      4.2.

If HealthGate fails to complete the System development by the System             Completion Date, unless such failure results from the Publishers'             default in performing its obligations under this Agreement or from             an extension of time agreed in writing, the Publishers may in their             discretion notify HealthGate accordingly, and if such failure is not             remedied within 28 calendar days, HealthGate, recognising the loss             caused to the Publishers, will on demand from the Publishers pay to             the Publishers a sum calculated at the rate of 1% of the value of             the contract in respect of every 28 days which elapse from the             System Completion Date to the actual date of completion of the             System. Such sums of money will be paid by HealthGate to the             Publishers not as a penalty but as and for the ascertained and             liquidated damages owing and payable by HealthGate to the Publishers             by reason of such failure to meet the System Completion Date.\n\n      5.2.  If HealthGate fails to complete the System by the end of the tenth             week after the System Completion Date then the Publishers (unless             such failure demonstrably results from the Publishers' default in             the performance of its obligations under this Agreement) will be             entitled without prejudice to any other rights or remedies they may             have under this Agreement or at law or in equity to terminate this             Agreement immediately by written notice.\n\n      5.3.  If any delay in meeting the System Completion Date is in any way due             to the Publishers' fault, HealthGate will nevertheless, if the             Publishers so requests, continue with the work on the Project with a             view to completing it as soon as reasonably possible in the             circumstances, and the Development Timetable will be adjusted             accordingly.\n\n6.    Project Management\n\n      6.1.  HealthGate and the Publishers shall each designate the name,             address, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail address of a             Project Manager and a Deputy Project Manager. The Project Managers             shall be responsible for arranging all meetings, visits, and             consultations between the parties, and for the transmission and             receipt of technical information between the parties. The parties'             initial Project Manager and Deputy Project Manager is set forth on             the Third Schedule hereto.\n\n      6.2.  If HealthGate has reason to believe that any estimate of any time is             likely to be exceeded or that it is likely that the Development             Timetable will not be complied with, HealthGate will immediately             inform the Publishers' Project Manager by written notice.\n\n                                       5\n\n7.    Content\n\n      The Publishers, at their cost and expense, shall make available the       Content in loadable electronic format to HealthGate as specified in the       Specification. HealthGate shall remotely load the Content into a staging       area.\n\n8.    Procurement of Hardware\n\n      HealthGate shall maintain the Site on HealthGate's web server and/or other       servers through the term of this Agreement insofar as it relates to the       Services. HealthGate shall acquire and maintain all necessary equipment       and hardware (collectively the \"Hardware\") for Site. The Hardware shall be       capable of storing the Content, including future issues of the Journals       within the Content. HealthGate shall replace and upgrade such Hardware to       satisfy the requirements of the Specification. The Hardware for the Site       shall include redundancy so that the Site may remain operational despite       an equipment failure. The Hardware shall be located at HealthGate's       computer facilities in Malden, Massachusetts. The Hardware may be       relocated only with Publishers' written consent, which consent shall not       be unreasonably withheld. HealthGate, at its cost and expense, shall       maintain adequate access via telecommunications to the Site at service\n\n\n\n\n\n      levels that shall be maintained at the same extent as HealthGate provides       to its own users.\n\n9.    Testing, Acceptance and Delivery\n\n      9.1.  Upon completion of the Development Work HealthGate and the             Publishers shall run acceptance tests to assure compliance with the             Specification. Load testing will be conducted at HealthGate. Such             period of acceptance testing shall not exceed 2 weeks from date of             delivery for testing.\n\n      9.2.  Upon passing the acceptance tests, the System shall be deemed             Accepted\n\n      9.3.  Upon Acceptance as provided in Clause 9.2 HealthGate shall deliver             into escrow the source code, source listings and information for the             Proprietary Software included in the System in accordance with the             terms of the Escrow Agreement.\n\n      9.4.  In the event that the system fails to pass any of the prescribed             acceptance tests or fails to satisfy the Publishers' requirements,             the Publishers shall afford HealthGate the opportunity of             rectifying, replacing and retesting the System. In the event that             the System or any part thereof again fails to be accepted, such             acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld, or to satisfy the             Publishers' requirements of which the Publishers shall be the sole             judge, the Publishers shall (as time is of the essence of this             Agreement) be entitled, in addition to any other rights it may have             under this Agreement or in law, to have HealthGate remove the             Content from the System (in whole or in part as the Publishers so\n\n                                       6\n\n            instructs) and HealthGate shall be liable to refund forthwith any             moneys paid by the Publishers for such rejected System or part             thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon acceptance of System             launch, as noted in Clause 19.2.4, HealthGate shall be entitled to             retain all monies paid by Publishers to this point.\n\n            In such circumstances HealthGate shall be entitled to retain the             first $250,000 paid by the Publishers to develop the Specification.\n\n10.   Licence\n\n      10.1. Proprietary Software\n\n            HealthGate hereby grants to the Publishers a non-exclusive             non-transferable licence to use the Proprietary Software for the             purposes of this Agreement\n\n            Save in relation to the Publishers' logos, trademarks, and content,             HealthGate may use and/or licence the Proprietary Software for             itself or for others without any compensation or liability to the             Publishers.\n\n            All Proprietary Software and Source Code remain the property of             HealthGate. Publishers may not use either Proprietary Software or             Source Code held in escrow to develop a product that competes with             those services offered by HealthGate.

Assistance upon Termination\n\n      On termination of the provision of the Services by HealthGate to the       Publishers for any reason:\n\n                                       10\n\n      18.1.

Continuing to perform, for a reasonable period (as\n\n\n\n\n\n                    determined by the Publishers) of up to six (6) months                     following the termination date, any or all of the Services                     then being performed by HealthGate.\n\n            33.1.2. Developing, together with the Publishers, a plan for the                     orderly transition of Services (\"Transition Plan\") then                     being performed by HealthGate from HealthGate to the                     Publishers or such successor provider of Services.\n\n            33.1.3. Providing reasonable training for personnel of the                     Publishers in the performance of the Services then being                     transitioned to the Publishers or such successor provider of                     Services.\n\n                                       22\n\n      33.2. If HealthGate is then using any Equipment leased or owned by the             Publishers to provide services to any third party, HealthGate may             continue to use that Equipment for that purpose until such time as             HealthGate can reasonably transition to other equipment.\n\n      33.3. Upon receipt of written notice from the Publishers that HealthGate             is in default under this Agreement by failing to comply with the             requirements of this Clause 33, or that HealthGate is in default             under any provision regarding rights upon termination of this             Agreement, HealthGate shall have ten (10) business days in which to             cure such default. HealthGate acknowledges that, in the event             HealthGate fails to cure such default within the specified time             period, the Publishers would suffer irreparable harm, and             HealthGate, hereby agrees that the Publishers would in such event be             entitled to obtain from a court of competent jurisdiction an order             of specific performance, in addition to such other rights and             remedies to which it may be entitled at law or in equity under this             Agreement.\n\n      33.4. Upon the termination of this Agreement or HealthGate's engagement             whichever shall be the earlier, HealthGate or its personal             representative as the case may be, shall immediately deliver up to             the Publishers all correspondence, reports, documents,             specifications, papers, information (on whatever media) and property             belonging to the Publishers which may be in his possession or under             his control together with all confidential information or copyright             works belonging to the Publishers specified in Clauses 27 and 31             above.\n\n34.   General\n\n      34.1. Waiver\n\n            Failure or neglect by either party to enforce at any time any of the             provisions hereof shall not be construed nor shall be deemed to be a             waiver of that party's rights hereunder nor in any way affect the             validity of the whole or any part of this Agreement nor prejudice             that party's rights to take subsequent action.\n\n      34.2. Entire Agreement\n\n            This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties.             Each party confirms that it has not relied upon any representation             not recorded in this document or in its Schedules inducing it to             enter this Agreement. No variation of these terms and conditions             will be valid unless confirmed in writing by authorized signatories             of both parties.\n\n                                       23\n\n      34.3. Assignment\n\n            HealthGate shall not transfer or assign the whole or any part of             this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Publishers.\n\n      34.4. Headings\n\n            he headings of the terms and conditions herein contained are             inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to             be part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of any of the             terms and conditions of this Agreement.\n\n      34.5. Severability\n\n            In the event that any of these terms, conditions or provisions shall             be determined by any competent authority to be invalid, unlawful or             unenforceable to any extent, such term, condition or provision shall             to that extent be severed from the remaining terms, conditions and             provisions which shall continue to be valid to the fullest extent             permitted by law.\n\n      34.6. Notices\n\n            Any notice to be given by either party to the other may be sent by\n\n\n\n\n\n            registered post or airmail to the address to the other party as             appearing herein and if so sent shall be deemed to be served 4 days             following the date of posting, or may be sent by courier and if so             shall be deemed to be received when actually received.\n\n      34.7. Injunctive Relief\n\n            All claims within the scope of this Agreement that any party may             have against the other for monetary damages must, subject to Clause             29 (Source Code and Escrow), be pursued through the procedures             established in this Agreement. However, nothing in this Clause 34.7             will prevent any party from immediately seeking injunctive or other             equitable relief from any court having competent jurisdiction.\n\n                                       24\n\n      34.8.

Since the focus of this project is to expand readership and usage, the design of this project will be driven by user needs and interests.\n\nThe following scenarios illustrate how to optimally meet the needs and offer the widest selection of services to Blackwell/Munksgaard users through a series of chronological steps and options. A user is defined as any party (including individuals or other systems) that will interface with the Blackwell/Munksgaard Journal Publishing system.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- List of Scenarios - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      Below is a list of the scenarios.

Scenarios\n\n      This chapter contains the Blackwell/Munksgaard Journal Publishing system       user scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Registration - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGeneral Registration\n\n      Users who access Blackwell/Munksgaard publications will fall into one of       three categories:\n\n      a)    Non-registered users who are browsing Blackwell/Munksgaard content.             These users will have limited access to some free content, but will             not be able to access other areas or purchase products.\n\n      b)    Registered users who have provided name, email and postal mailing             address, but have not provided credit card data. Users in this             category include those who have visited the site before and have             been assigned a user name and password, as well as Society members             who have previously registered.\n\n      c)    Purchasing users who have registered, and provided credit card             information. These users may have bought subscriptions to             Blackwell/Munksgaard journals or other publications in the past.\n\n      For any but the most casual browser, general registration is encouraged,       and outlined below.\n\n      1.    Registration procedure: If a non-registered user would like to             access certain areas or services, there will be a link provided to             the registration area.\n\n            Once the user has entered the registration area, s/he will be asked             to provide full name, email address, and postal address. After this             information has been entered, the user will be provided with a             dialog box to enter a self-selected user name and password.\n\n      2.    Creating user name: The user name is checked for uniqueness against             all user names, then added to the database. If the name has already             been registered, the user will be provided with three suggested             names, or the option to create another user name of their own             choice.\n\n      3.    Confirmation of registration: Once a unique user name and password             have been assigned, the user may choose to continue the purchase             process by linking to pages that will enable him/her to enter credit             card information (see \"Credit Card Subscription Registration\"             below). If no purchase is desired at this time, the user will end             the registration process at this point S/he will see a page that             confirms their registration. Shortly afterwards, the user will also             receive an email acknowledging their registration, and providing             instructions on what to do if they forget their user name and             password. This will also serve to ensure that the user's email             address as entered in the registration form is correct.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD PUBLISHING SYSTEM                                         3\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                                      REGISTRATION - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCredit Card Subscription Registration\n\n      Users will now be able to order subscriptions to Blackwell/Munksgaard       journals and publications online via a simple registration and secure       payment process. In this scenario, the user chooses to pay with a credit       card.\n\n      1.    Registration: When the user enters the registration area, s/he will             be asked to provide their user name and password. (See \"General             Registration\" above).\n\n      2.    Tracking marketing efforts: A feature to track the efficacy of             marketing campaigns may also be incorporated. In addition to             entering the above subscriber information, the user will also be             asked to provide information pertaining to offer codes, or other             identifying characteristics of marketing offers.\n\n      3.    Separating society memberships: Users are asked if they are a member             of a society participating in the online journals. If they select a             society, their registration information will be checked with an             updated automated listing of existing society members. Since a             society member is entitled to pre-defined journal subscriptions             under a separate agreement, this is done to ensure that a society             member is not charged. If the registering user is determined to be a             society member, follow the \"Society Member Registration\" scenario             instead.\n\n      4.    Selecting a subscription plan: After entering the registration             information, the user will be prompted to select a subscription             plan.\n\n      5.    Charging subscriptions: Once the subscription plan has been             selected, the user will then be shown a page that provides a secure             connection for credit card information. The user will be asked to\n\n\n\n\n\n            give the credit card number, type (VISA, MasterCard, AMEX,             Discover), and expiration date.\n\n      6.    Transaction receipt: The credit card is then validated and the user             is shown the cost that has been charged to the credit card. A             receipt is displayed on the screen, as well as emailed to the user.\n\n      7.    Thanks/Email notification of future publications: After the             registration process is completed, the user will see a page thanking             them for their subscription order. As an added feature, new users             will be offered the option of having the table of contents of each             new issue emailed to them upon publication.\n\n      8.    Next destination: When the above information is provided, the user             will then be given access to the cover page of the journal that has             just been ordered.\n\nSociety Member / Institutional Subscriber Self Registration\n\n      If a user is determined to be a Society member or a paid subscriber not       know to the system (pre-subscribed by Blackwell/Munksgaard), the following       scenario applies:\n\n      1.    Access from marketing efforts: Society membership benefits include             subscriptions to pre-defined print journals. In accordance with             marketing efforts, inserts promoting online journal registration and             the URL for the Blackwell/Munksgaard site will be provided in these             journals. Members may also find out about online service via other             marketing efforts, such as newsletters, leaflets, direct mail or             other web sites.\n\n      2.    Registration info: Once the user accesses the site, he/she will be             provided with a form asking for basic registration information (see             \"Credit Card Subscription Registration,\" steps 1-7).\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                        4\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                                      REGISTRATION - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      3.    Membership options: If the name has been matched and verified online             as a Society member, the user is presented with a listing of             publications and journals, etc. which they may access with existing             membership privileges.\n\n            If the user is not verified as a current Society member, the user             will be asked to provide standard registration information (see             \"Credit Card Subscription Registration\").\n\n            In addition to the publication listings, users will be given one of             three options as defined by the publisher to receive these             subscriptions:\n\n            a. Exclusive online access\n\n            b. Print subscription and optional online access\n\n            c. Full access via both print subscription and online\n\n      4.    Content for purchase: Once users have selected their subscription             method, they will be shown additional content available for             purchase.\n\n      5.    Creating identity code for user: When content for purchase has been             selected by the user, s/he will see a form that enables them to             create a user name and password. Once the information has been             entered, another dialog box will prompt them to confirm the             password.\n\n      6.    Assuring uniqueness of code: The user name is checked for uniqueness             against all user names, and added to the list. If the user name has             already been registered, they will be provided with three suggested             names, or the option to create another user name of their own             choice.\n\n      7.    Purchasing additional content: If the user chooses to purchase any             of the additional content, the purchase will be charged to the             credit card information previously provided. The credit card is             validated and charged. If the credit card is declined, the user is             prompted to try again.\n\n      8.    Transaction receipt: Once the credit card has been validated, the             page shows the cost that has been charged to the credit card.             Receipt is presented on the screen, as well as emailed to the user.\n\n      9.    Final step of purchasing process: As the final step in the             purchasing process, the user will see a page that thanks them for             their order, and shows a listing of all content purchased in the             last transaction.\n\n            After purchasing process has been completed, the user will then be             given access to their selected content. A confirmation email will be             sent welcoming the user to our service.\n\n\n\n\n\nPurchase Order or Deposit Account for Institutional Subscribers\n\n      For those institutions that wish to order subscriptions to       Blackwell/Munksgaard journals, publications, and single full-text articles       on a consistent basis, an open purchase order or deposit account may be       established. The following scenario outlines how a customer would have       access via this method.\n\n      1.    Initial set-up: The customer will make the initial contact to             Blackwell/Munksgaard to set up the account. Open purchase orders and             deposit accounts may be established through either             Blackwell/Munksgaard or HealthGate.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                        5\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                                      REGISTRATION - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      2.    Access code: After the account has been established, users will then             be given a special access code to access the Site. When registering             the user will be able to use the access code instead of providing us             with credit card information (Access to publications via IP address             verification is an option for institutional accounts).\n\n      3.    Registration: When the user completes registration the same way as a             normal customer, except that they enter the access code rather than             provide billing information. Any charges or purchases will be             applied to their account.\n\n      4.    Account expiration: If the account expires, or reaches the monetary             cap assigned, the user will be shown a page that prompts them to             contact Blackwell/Munksgaard to renew the account. This page will             also provide the option to continue and have purchases applied to a             credit card. A report will be available warning Blackwell/Munksgaard             of accounts that are close to expiring.\n\nTransaction Registration /Single Document Purchase by non registered user\n\n      This scenario outlines the way in which a user would be able to purchase a       single article (document) while browsing the abstract of the article.\n\n      1.    Promoting full text articles: Abstracts are available to all users             free of charge; registration is not required. However, if the user             would like to buy the full text of any given article, pricing             information for the article will be listed at the end of the             abstract, with a link to purchase the article.\n\n      2.    Purchasing full text -- registered users: After selecting the link             to purchase the article, the user is given the option to log in,             using the previously assigned registration user name and password.             After logging in, a page showing full text articles and journal             subscriptions for purchase will be provided. The user will make             his/her selections, and the credit card information page will             appear. (Go to step #5)\n\n      3.    Purchasing full text -- new users: If the user has never registered             before, they will be asked to register.\n\n      4.    Registration: When the user enters the registration area, s/he will             be asked to provide basic identifying information (See \"General             Registration\" above).\n\n      5.    Credit card info: The user will then be shown a page that provides a             secure connection for credit card information. The user will be             asked to give the credit card number, type (VISA, MasterCard, AMEX,             Discover), and expiration date.\n\n      6.    Credit card validation: The credit card is validated, and the user             is given confirmation that they are about to be charged for the             requested full text article(s) and/or journal subscription(s).\n\n      7.    Fax delivery/other purchase options: An option to have the article             faxed to them for an additional fee (to be determined) is also             offered.\n\n      8.    Transaction confirmation: Once the user has completed the above             steps, a receipt listing all purchases is shown on the page; a copy             will also be emailed to them.\n\n      9.    Transaction cancellation: If the user cancels the transaction, then             they are returned to the abstract of the article.\n\n      10.   Content access: After the user confirms the charge, s/he is given             access to the content for a specified period of time (hours/days to             be determined.)\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                        6\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                                         PURCHASES - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n            Articles are provided to the user in both PDF and HTML format\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Purchases - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      The scenarios below outline single document purchases. There also will be       a facility to purchase multiple documents in a shopping basked like       manner.\n\nSingle Document Purchase Registered User with CC Information\n\n      In this scenario, a registered user requests a document to which they do       not currently have access. For example, they may be viewing an abstract       from a journal that is not part of their subscription, or they may be       referencing a new document (full text) In this scenario we assume that the       user has a credit card on file or an open purchase order (PO).\n\n      1.    Registration update: At the end of an abstract, a link is provided             which enables the user to purchase a related document or product             (i.e., full text article, journal subscription, book, etc.) The link             brings the user to a page that offers purchase options, lists the             price of the full text article and allows registered users to enter             their user name and password. Non-registered users would have to             register in order to enter credit card information.\n\n      2.    Login: Registered users will log on, confirming registration. Then             they will be shown a price confirmation and delivery options.\n\n      3.    Optional fax delivery: If the requested document is an article, the             user will be offered an option to have the article faxed for an             additional fee (to be determined).\n\n      4.    Transaction confirmation: Once the user has completed the above             steps, a receipt listing all purchases is shown on the page; a copy             will also be emailed to them.\n\n      5.    Transaction cancellation: If the user cancels the transaction, they             are returned to the abstract of the article.\n\n      6.    Content access: After the user confirms the charge, s/he is given             access to the content for a specified period of time (hours/days to             be determined.)\n\n            Articles are provided to the user in both HTML and PDF formats.\n\nSingle Document Purchase Registered User without CC Information\n\n      In this scenario, a registered user requests to see a document to which       they do not currently have access. For example, they may be viewing an       abstract from a new journal and decide they would like to subscribe. In       this scenario, we assume that the user does not have a credit card on file       or an open PO.\n\n      1.    Registration update: At the end of an abstract, a link is provided             which enables the user to purchase a related document or product             (i.e., full text article, journal subscription, book, etc.) The link             brings the user to a page that offers purchase options, and lists             the price of the full text article. The user will be asked to a)             register, or b) login.\n\n      2.    Login. Registered users will login.\n\n      3.    Credit card info: Then if they do not have credit card information             on file or if their credit card has expired, they will be shown a             page which provides a secure connection for credit card information.             The user will be asked to give the credit card number, type (VISA,             MasterCard, AMEX, Discover), and expiration date.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                        7\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                                         PURCHASES - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      4.    Credit card validation: The credit card is validated, and the user             is given confirmation that they are about to be charged for the             requested full text article(s) journal subscription(s), etc. (Any             relevant discounts will be shown on screen at this time.)\n\n      5.    Optional fax delivery: If the requested document is an article, the             user will be offered an option to have the article faxed for an             additional fee (to be determined).\n\n      6.    Transaction confirmation: Once the user has completed the above             steps, a receipt listing all purchases is shown on the page; a copy             will also be emailed to them.\n\n      7.    Transaction cancellation: If the user cancels the transaction, they             are returned to the abstract of the article.\n\n      8.    Content access: After the user confirms the charge, he/she is given             access to the content for a specified period of time (hours/days to\n\n\n\n\n\n            be determined).\n\n            Articles are provided to the user in both HTML and PDF formats.\n\nSingle Document Purchase Registered User using Purchase Order\n\n      In this scenario, a registered user requests a document to which they do       not currently have access and choose to pay via an existing purchase order       which they have set up with Blackwell/Munksgaard. If they do not have a       purchase order, they will be asked to contact Blackwell/Munksgaard.\n\n      1.    Registration update: At the end of an abstract, a link is provided             which enables the user to purchase a related document or product             (i.e., full text article, journal subscription, book, etc.) The link             brings the user to a page that offers purchase options, and lists             the price of the full text article. The user will be asked to a)             register, or b) login.\n\n      2.    Login. Registered users will login with an account that has been             tagged for all charges to be applied to an existing purchase order.\n\n      3.    Purchase Order validation: The purchase order is validated to assure             that this charge will not go over the total amount on the purchase             order. The user is given confirmation that they are about to be             charged for the requested full text article(s). (Any relevant             discounts will be shown on screen at this time.)\n\n      4.    Optional fax delivery: If the requested document is an article, the             user will be offered an option to have the article faxed for an             additional fee (to be determined).\n\n      5.    Transaction confirmation: Once the user has completed the above             steps, a receipt listing all purchases is shown on the page; a copy             will also be emailed to them.\n\n      6.    Transaction cancellation: If the user cancels the transaction, they             are returned to the abstract of the article.\n\n      7.    Content access: After the user confirms the charge, he/she is given             access to the content for a specified period of time (hours/days to             be determined.)\n\n            Articles are provided to the user in both HTML and PDF formats.\n\nAdditional Subscription Purchase\n\n      Online users will be provided with several opportunities throughout the       site to subscribe to other journals; these purchase options will be       inserted in areas that contextually will promote the likelihood of a sale.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                        8\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                                           LINKING - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      The following scenario provides an example of how the need for additional       full text articles and/or a journal subscription results in a sale.\n\n      1.    Point of entry: A user reads an article in a journal to which they             subscribe. Searching for more information in this subject area, the             user clicks on the link to related articles.\n\n      2.    Exposure to new journal: After viewing the list of related articles,             the user notes that the articles of the most interest are all in a             journal to which s/he does not currently subscribe. At this point             the user has a choice: s/he may either purchase the full text of             some or all the articles, or consider a subscription to the journal             itself, which will provide unlimited access to these and other             articles year-round. The user decides to find out more information             about the journal.\n\n      3.    Journal description: All journal titles will be linked. When the             user clicks on a journal link, he/she will see a page that provides             a brief description of the journal, the frequency of publication,             and pricing information.\n\n      4.    Purchasing procedure: The user decides to purchase the journal.             Since this user has already subscribed to at least one other             journal, his/her identification and credit card data are already             stored in the system.\n\n            The user is given the option of charging the subscription to the             existing account, or entering new credit card information. (See             \"Credit Card Subscription Registration\" above).\n\n      5.    Confirmation of purchase: Once the user has indicated which credit             card is to be charged, the purchase is charged and validated. The             user will then be shown a page that provides a receipt for the             journal subscription purchase. Confirmation of the purchase will             also be sent to the user via email.\n\n      6.    Other tie-ins to purchase: After confirmation, the user may link to             his/her own custom page to find that the new subscription has been\n\n\n\n\n\n            documented, and the custom page updated.\n\n      7.    Next destination: At the end of the transaction, the user will be             shown the selected volume of the journal.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Linking - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBibliographic Linking within an Article\n\n      This scenario illustrates how a user would link to and from bibliographic       information contained within an article.\n\n      1.    Reference links: Reference citations within all articles will be             linked to bibliographic references (or endnotes.) When the user             clicks on the citation in the article, a page showing the complete             listing of references for that article will be displayed.\n\n      2.    Database links: When the user clicks on the MEDLINE link, s/he will             be shown the corresponding MEDLINE abstract for the cited article,             if the journal is indexed for inclusion in MEDLINE. (Similar             functionality will exist with ISI Web of Science).\n\n      3.    Full text/Journal subscription purchase option: If full text is             available for the cited reference, it will be offered for purchase             at this point; journal subscription purchase may be offered as well.             Abstracts will also be available from the references. These purchase             options will be displayed along with pricing information. If the             user is not a subscriber to the cited journal, and chooses to             purchase the article, or subscribe to the journal, new pages\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                        9\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                  DELIVERY OPTIONS OTHER THAN HTML - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n            leading them through the purchase process will automatically be             shown. (See \"Single Document Purchase\" and \"Additional Subscription             Purchase\" above.)\n\n      4.    Subscription tracking: If the user is already a subscriber to the             journal that contains the selected article, the user will be             informed that they may access the article free.\n\n      5.    Other reference options: All articles will also contain a side bar             which lists (and links to) other full text articles available within             the Blackwell/Munksgaard collection that references this article             (forward bibliographic references).\n\n      6.    In Press Bibliographic Links: Links will not exist to bibliographic             references that are still in press. However, the system will check             regularly to link them once the article has been published.\n\n      7.    Exit from abstract: The user will also be able to return to the             previous article from the abstract.\n\nRelated Information Links\n\n      When viewing an article, the user will be provided with a side bar that       outlines several related links pertaining to the article they are       currently reading. In this scenario, we highlight some of the different       types of links that may be offered.\n\n      1.    Author listing: The names of all authors of the current article will             be provided as links. When the user clicks on the link of a selected             author, s/he will be presented with a listing of other articles             written by that author. These titles will be linked to the             corresponding abstract and/or full text. If available, full text             purchase and/or PDF versions of the selected article will be             offered.\n\n      2.    Related articles by subject: A listing of related linked subject             areas will also be provided. When the user clicks on these areas,             s/he will receive a listing of related articles searched by MeSH             headings and keywords.\n\n      3.    Related published information: Users interested in reading other             published information related to the chosen article will find that             the side bar provides them with links to:\n\n            a. Correspondence (letters, editorials, etc) pertaining to that             article\n\n            b. Errata (article addenda, corrections, etc.) pertaining to that             article\n\n      4.    Services: The user will also be able to take advantage of certain             services. One service will be the ability to email the URL of a             chosen article to a colleague. When the user chooses this option,             s/he will be presented with a page to enter an email address, and a             \"send\" button.\n\n\n\n\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Delivery Options Other than HTML - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDownloading PDF\n\n      For those full text articles available in PDF format, the user will be       given the option of PDF downloading.\n\n      1.    Linked PDF option: On the article page, a link offering the PDF             option will be found. The users will have the option to download the             PDF file or have it emailed to them. If the user choose to download             the document they will be prompted to save it.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                       10\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                               SUBSCRIBER FEATURES - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      2.    Adobe instructions for downloading: If the user does not have             Acrobat installed, the download page will explain the need to             install the Acrobat plug-in. A link to Adobe for detailed             instructions on how to install the plug-in will be provided.\n\n            If the user does not wish to download Acrobat at that time, the user             will be prompted to download to their hard drive. They may open the             PDF document after Acrobat has been downloaded at their convenience.\n\nFax Delivery\n\n            Users who want the benefits of how an article appears in PDF, but             who do not wish to download the article in this format, can request             fax delivery of the article for an additional charge.\n\n      1.    After confirming that the user wishes to purchase an article (or in             the case of subscriptions, displaying the record on screen), the             user selects the method of displaying the article: HTML, PDF, or             \"Receive via Fax.\" Because this is a premium option, the user will             be asked to confirm the additional fees for fax delivery.\n\n      2.    The user then supplies their fax number.\n\n      3.    To keep costs low, the article is relayed to a commercial fax             service, such as FaxNet, which sends the information via Web-based             fax to the user.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Subscriber Features - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUser Access to their Custom Page\n\n      Another free feature offered to Blackwell/Munksgaard subscribers is a       custom-designed page which will provide them with information tailored to       their unique areas of interest, as well as accounting of their       subscription plans and other services. The following are highlights of       features that may be offered to subscribers.\n\n      1.    Initial log-in: The user accesses the Blackwell/Munksgaard Journals             home page. From this page there is a login link that requires the             user to enter their user name and password (if they are unable to             remember their user name and password, they may enter their email             address, which will then provide them with the correct login             information via return email). Once the correct information has been             entered, subscribers are brought to their custom page.\n\n      2.    Custom Page features: The custom page will provide the user with:\n\n            a. Subscription information: All subscription information pertaining             to the user's account will be provided, including: names of journal             subscriptions (listed and linked), pricing of each subscription, and             the duration of subscription.\n\n            b. Updates on new content: Each subscriber will be provided with             updates on new content that correlates to their specified area(s) of             interest. This includes new journal articles, correspondence, news,             etc.\n\n            c. Customer Service: Users can choose to change their password,             subscriptions, credit card information, etc. by accessing the             customer service area at any time. Users may also email questions             regarding their subscription in this customer service area.\n\n            d. Searching: The user will have a variety of methods to track and             save searches from the custom page, including:\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                       11\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                                  JOURNAL FEATURES - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n                  i) Entering searches from various journal sets (e.g., searches                   of just Blackwell/Munksgaard journals, or all journals in a                   related subject area.)\n\n                  ii) Saved searches: The user will have the ability to view the                   last five documents reviewed or the last five subject area                   searches conducted.\n\n                  iii) Collaborative filtering: In the future once an article                   has been read, a user may choose to review which related                   articles have been read by other users. A listing of the most                   frequently accessed articles in the topic will be provided.\n\n                  (For a more detailed description of the searching                   capabilities, see the \"Searching\" category below.)\n\n            e. Promotions and advertising: The user will be notified in the             Custom Page of any promotions that may be of interest (i.e.,             discount rates, product offers, society notices, etc.) In addition,             users will be able to view advertising pertaining to their interests             on this page.\n\n            f. Interactive communication: This area will contain features that             allow users to communicate via email with Blackwell/Munksgaard. This             may be used, for example, to post notices of errata for articles. A             mechanism for acknowledging these notices will also be provided.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Journal Features - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      The following scenarios pertain to organization of the journals and their       various components on the Blackwell/Munksgaard site.\n\nJournal Page\n\n      Users will be able to access information pertaining to subscriptions and       other publisher information directly from the journal pages, which will be       customized for each specific journal. We recommend that these pages follow       a standardized format, including links to the following (where       applicable):\n\n      a)    Publisher's home page: A link will bring the user to the home page             of the appropriate publisher of the journal, either             Blackwell/Munksgaard Science Ltd., Blackwell/Munksgaard Science             Inc., or Munksgaard.\n\n      b)    Society's home page: If the journal is published for a society,             users will be able to directly link to the society's home page\n\n      c)    Journal information: Information regarding publication cycles and             other publication information will be provided via this link.\n\n      d)    Journal subscriptions: If a user wishes to find detailed information             about subscribing to journals, this link will bring them to a page             which will provide pricing information, etc.\n\n      e)    Journal listing by publisher: This link will provide the user with a             complete listing of journals, categorized by publisher\n\n      f)    Listing of available back issues: For users wishing to search             previous journal issues, this link will show a listing of back             issues available\n\n      g)    Current table of contents: Users will be able to quickly access the             most current table of contents from this link\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                       12\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                                  JOURNAL FEATURES - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      h)    Submission information: Prospective authors will find author's             guidelines and other submission information at this link\n\n      i)    Letter to the editor via email: Users who wish to contribute             opinions to the journal editor will be able to link to a pop-up             email window, and send correspondence via email.

A link from the bibliographic reference to the abstract             (pulled from secondary databases, reference databases), if             available, is provided. If the corresponding article is available             online in the Blackwell/Munksgaard collection, a link to the             full-text with option to purchase will be provided.\n\n      b)    Publication listing by author: All primary authors of the article             will be listed. The name of each author will be linked so that if             the user selects the author's name, a listing will be provided of             other available articles written this author. Again, these articles             in turn will be linked to their corresponding abstracts. If the             corresponding article is available online in the             Blackwell/Munksgaard collection, a link to the full-text with option             to purchase will be provided.\n\n      c)    Link by keywords: The user will be provided with an option to search             for other related articles by keyword.\n\n      d)    Email option: If a user would like to send a link to the abstract to             a colleague, an email window will be available. The user only needs             to type in the destination email address, and an automatic message             providing the article title and corresponding URL of the abstract             will be sent.\n\n      e)    Supplemental Information: Links to supplemental information related             to the article will be presented if the information is available.\n\nEmail version of Table of Contents\n\n      A valuable reminder of newly released publications is the table of       contents email option. If users choose this feature (usually done during       subscription registration and payment), they will be sent the new table of       contents for each journal to which they have subscribed. This feature will       be available to both subscribers as well as non-subscribing users.\n\n\n\n\n\n      This scenario shows what a user can do after receiving an emailed version       of the table of contents. The scenario has two parts: one for text-based       email, the other for HTML enabled email.\n\nText Email\n\n      1.    Receipt of email announcement: User receives an email message and             opens it in their email reader.\n\n      2.    Table of contents listing: The message contains the table of             contents of the newly published issue of the journal.\n\n      3.    URL linking: The email contains the URL for the Blackwell/Munksgaard             site. This link will be \"live\" in most email readers, and will bring             the user directly to the online version of the table of contents.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                       14\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                                         SEARCHING - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      4.    Article linking: Once the user accesses the table of contents, s/he             will find that all titles are linked to abstracts and the online             full text article.\n\nHTML Email\n\n      1.    Receipt of email announcement: The user receives an HTML based email             message, and opens it in their HTML enabled mail reader (e.g.,             Outlook Express, Outlook 98, Netscape 3.x and higher).\n\n      2.    Table of contents: The message contains the complete table of             contents, and may be viewed exactly as it would look on the web             site.\n\n      3.    URL linking: The email contains the URL for the Blackwell/Munksgaard             site. This link will be clickable in most email readers, and will             bring the user directly to the online version of the table of             contents.\n\n      4.    Article linking: Once the user accesses the table of contents, s/he             will find that all titles are linked to abstracts and the online             full text article.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Searching - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      The capacity to search using a variety of keywords and subject headings is       of critical importance to users, and is an especially important feature of       the Blackwell/Munksgaard site.\n\n      Users will have the ability to select which set of journals to search.       Some example sets are: All Full Text Journals, All Subscribed Journals,       and Journals by particular Publisher. Searches that return a single       document will forward the user to the abstract or full text if they have       access to the full text.\n\n      The following scenarios outline several ways in which a subscriber may       search for content. In addition to offering different types of searching       mechanisms (i.e., \"quick searches\" through advanced searches), users will       also be able to access the searching capability from various areas of the       site. The following scenarios outline some of the search possibilities.\n\nQuick Search\n\n      A \"Quick Search\" enables the user to search on a topic (e.g., insulin       pumps) and obtain a listing of areas where this topic is cited.\n\n      1.    From custom page: From the custom page, users would enter a keyword             or phrase in the quick search box. The user would select the All             Subscribed journal set, and then submit the query.\n\n      2.    Results: The search returns a listing of all articles; each linked             to the full text, PDF, and the abstract where available.\n\n      3.    Save Query: On the results page, the user would have the option of             saving the query. This adds the query to the user's customized page.\n\nSearching Full Text\n\n      Another option is to search the entire full text of a document for       specific terms. The following is a sample of how this search could be       conducted from the user's custom page.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                       15\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                                     CUSTOMER HELP - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n      1.    Advanced search option: The user selects the advanced search option             from the search box.\n\n      2.    Document choice: The user decides to view only abstracts; s/he             selects this choice from the pull down list of available fields to             search.\n\n      3.    Subject choice: The user chooses the keyword or phrase they wish to             search, (e.g., lispro or Humalog), and enters it into the advanced             search form. This criterion is then added to the query.\n\n      4.    Journal choice: The user then selects the journal set to search, and             selects the \"All Full Text Journals\" option. The query is then             submitted.\n\n      5.    Results: The results contain a listing of all full text articles             available that match the user's search criteria. Included in this             list is the price of each full text document that references these             keywords, with the option to download. In addition, the entries that             the user has subscription access to would be noted. Results can be             ordered by relevancy, date, author and journal title.\n\n            The user has the ability to save the query.\n\nFinding an Article Cited Elsewhere\n\n      This scenario provides the user with HealthGate's Citation Finder       Technology. It allows a subscriber the ability to quickly locate the       abstract (and the full text if available) from a bibliographic reference.\n\n      1.    Access from custom page: From the registered subscriber's customized             page, s/he selects the Citation Finder option. The Citation Finder             page is pre-loaded and has a field for entry of the citation. The             user can either input the citation information or \"copy and paste\"             it into the appropriate fields. The Citation Finder does not require             information in all fields to execute a search successfully.\n\n      2.    Search criteria: The user then selects the fields, or information,             which s/he wants to search. Examples of these fields include author,             journal name, year, volume, issue, article title, and all fields.             For this example, the user selects author, article title, and             journal name.\n\n      3.    Results: The user submits the query. If an exact match is found, the             abstract will be provided. If not, the user is presented with a list             of matches from which to select.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Customer Help - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      Blackwell/Munksgaard will have administrative access to these features.       All access will be recorded to monitor any possible abuse.\n\nForgotten Password\n\n      When a user forgets his/her password, the system provides a mechanism for       the user to look up and find their password without calling customer       service. This scenario shows how that is accomplished:\n\n      1.    On the login page, a user who has forgotten their password selects             the link \"forgotten password.\"\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                       16\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                                     CUSTOMER HELP - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      2.    The user is asked to complete a form where the required information             is user name, first name, and last name.\n\n      3.    The system will search the user database to see if there is a match.             If there is a match, the system will send the user's password to the             email address on file. The system will then tell the user that their             password is being sent to them via email.\n\n      4.    If there is not a match, the system will prompt them to try again or             allow them to search for user name and password.\n\nForgotten User Name and Password\n\n      When a user forgets his/her password, the system provides a mechanism for       the user to look up and find their password without calling customer       service. This scenario shows how that is accomplished:\n\n      1.    On the login page, a user who has forgotten their password selects             the link \"forgotten password.\"\n\n      2.    If they do not remember their user name, the user is prompted to             enter their first name, last name, and email address.\n\n      3.    The system will compare the information supplied by the user against             the user database and email both the user name and password to the\n\n\n\n\n\n            address on file if there is a match.\n\n      4.    If there is not a match, the user is instructed to either try again             or contact customer service.\n\nChanging Password\n\n      Users often want to change their password. The system gives them an easy       way to do so.\n\n      1.    From the user's personal profile page, the user selects the link to             \"Modify Profile.\"\n\n      2.    The Modify Profile page will allow them to go to a change password             form.\n\n      3.    This form will ask the user to type their current password, then             enter a new password. To confirm, the user is asked to type their             new password again.\n\n      4.    Upon correct entry (the old password matched the one on file and the             two new passwords matched), the password will be updated and the             user will be told that the change has been made.\n\n      5.    If the entry is not correct then the user will be prompted to try             again.\n\nChanging Email Address\n\n      Users often want to change their email address. The system gives them an       easy way to do so.\n\n      1.    This feature is available in several places, such as the \"Modify             Profile\" page and the regularly scheduled email messages sent by the             system to the user.\n\n      2.    From the Modify Profile page, the user would select a link to change             their email address. From an email message, the user selects the             link embedded in the email. When accessing the appropriate page via             the email link, the user will be prompted for user name and             password.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                       17\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                                CONTENT MANAGEMENT - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      3.    A form will ask for the users new email address (actually allowing             them to edit their old email address).\n\n      4.    Upon successful entry, the email address is checked for validity and             an email message is sent the address for confirmation.\n\nChanging Credit Card Number\n\n      Users often want to change their credit card information on file. The       system gives them an easy way to do so. This method of updating the credit       card is also used when the credit card on file has expired. Customers with       expired credit cards are forced to enter a new credit card when they are       about to incur additional charges.\n\n      1.    This feature is available from the \"Modify Profile\" page.\n\n      2.    The user is connected to the secure server and asked to enter the             new credit card information.\n\n      3.    The credit card is validated with a credit card clearing house.\n\n      4.    If validated, the user is given a confirmation page.\n\n      5.    If the card is not validated, the user is asked to try again.\n\nChanging Other Information\n\n      Users are able to change other information off the \"Modify Profile\" page       by selecting the appropriate link. Examples of other information that may       be changed are postal address, purchasing new subscriptions, and change       the format in which they received emailed information (HTML verses text).\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Content Management - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJournal Setup\n\n      The procedure to setup new journals and their initial entry into the       system must be initiated by Blackwell/Munksgaard. It is possible to setup       a journal manually or electronically. The manual procedure for setting up       a new journal entry is as follows:\n\n      1.    The authorized Blackwell/Munksgaard employee establishes a             connection to the Administration side of the site.\n\n\n\n\n\n      2.    When prompted, the employee enters the appropriate user             name/password and establishes a secure connection.\n\n      3.    The employee selects the option New Journal and enters all             applicable information, such as title, copyright statements,             submissions, subscription, etc.\n\n      4.    The employee enters Society information, if applicable, including             name, links, and board members.\n\nSet Journal Price\n\n      It is possible to setup a journal price manually or electronically. After       setting up the basic journal information, pricing criteria may be entered:\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                       18\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                                CONTENT PUBLISHING - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      1.    The authorized Blackwell/Munksgaard employee accesses the             appropriate journal (the journal must be setup using the Journal             Setup before establishing the journal price) and selects the option             \"Journal Pricing.\"\n\n      2.    The employee then assigns the price in multiple currencies, any and             all subscription plans, including rates for print companion,             electronic only, and Society membership.\n\n      3.    The employee then assigns pricing for each of the selected             currencies.\n\nSet Document Price\n\n      1.    The default for all document pricing is established by             Blackwell/Munksgaard. The Blackwell/Munksgaard employee may override             the default and establish a special price for documents from a             specific journal title.\n\n      2.    To override the default document price, the employee accesses the             appropriate journal (the journal must be setup using the Journal             Setup before establishing the document price) and selects the option             \"Document Pricing.\"\n\n      3.    The employee then assigns the revised price in various currencies             for document delivery.\n\n      4.    The price may be revised to the default at any time by accessing the             journal and selecting the option to Restore Default Price.\n\nTemplate Submission\n\n      Initially, templates will be hand loaded by HealthGate Data Corp. to       insure security and consistency.\n\n      To accomplish this, an FTP location will be provided to allow templates to       be copied over and reviewed (and tested) prior to releasing them.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Content Publishing - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIssue Loading\n\n      1.    Loading upon receipt: All content for a new issue is loaded upon             receipt in a single directory.\n\n      2.    Identification: A form is completed which indicates appropriate             journal, issue, and volume. It is also possible to enter this             information electronically.\n\n      3.    Back-up: Upon submission, the content is copied to the content             repository, before conversion. This allows it to be referenced in             the future.\n\n      4.    Conversion: The content is then converted to our internal Extensible             Markup Language (XML) format.\n\n      5.    Storage: The XML version is then stored in the content repository.\n\n      6.    Parsing: The XML is then parsed to add more information, including             tags to link bibliographic information and related information.\n\n      7.    Storage of parsed content: This parsed XML version is also stored in             the content repository.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                       19\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                                THIRD PARTY ACCESS - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n      8.    Conversion to HTML: An Extensible Style Language (XSL) template is             used to convert the file to HTML.\n\n      9.    HTML on staging: The HTML version is made available on the staging             server.\n\nIssue Review\n\n      1.    The issue is made available on the staging server\n\n      2.    Email is sent to Blackwell/Munksgaard alerting the appropriate             personnel that the issue is available for review.\n\n      3.    An employee wishing to review the issue would log on to the staging             server, and select the content they wish to review. This is limited             to authorized users only. Authorization is by group of journals.\n\n      4.    The content is presented to them in the same way it is shown to an             end user. However, they also have access to a tool bar (in a frame).             The tool bar allows them to approve the content as well as adjust             some of the properties of the article.\n\n      5.    They can change the price or approve the article for release.\n\nIssue Release\n\n      An issue will be released automatically on the assigned electronic       publication date if all the articles contained in the issue have been       edited and approved for release. Blackwell/Munksgaard will be alerted to       content that has not be reviewed after a predetermined amount of time.\n\n      A Blackwell/Munksgaard employee would access the Journal Publishing       System, a secure area, and go to the System Control area.\n\n      1.    A list of issues that are ready or awaiting publication would be             available. When an issue is selected, the listing of properties for             that issue will be presented.\n\n      2.    The user would be able to adjust any of the properties.\n\n      3.    To publish the issue, the user would set the publication date to the             following day.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Third Party Access - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGeneral\n\n      Creating an abstract-only export: To create an abstract-only export, a       Blackwell/Munksgaard employee will need to determine the list of journal       abstracts to be included for extract, the formatting of the extract, and a       user profile of which third parties will have access to the extract file.\n\n      1.    Criteria: Once the above information has been determined, the             following information will need to be entered:\n\n            a. Frequency of updating abstract information,\n\n            b. Packaging method (tar, zip), push, pull or tape.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                       20\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                                         REPORTING - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      2.    Push extracts: For push extracts (extracts that are sent to someone             either via FTP or email), a user will have to enter the destination             email address, or the FTP server, directory, user name and password             to use.\n\n      3.    Pull extracts: For pull extracts (extracts that require someone to             pull the content off the journal server), a user will have to enter             the user name and password that the third party will use to retrieve             the content.\n\n      4.    Tape based abstracts: Tape based abstracts will be handled similar             to FTP pulls except that they would be loaded to tape and sent via             postal service.\n\nAbstracts Only (Headers)\n\n      Some customers want the abstracts only. This will allow bibliographic       database to receive the information in electronic form rather than having       to re-key the documents. Ideally, all databases would also receive       information pointing them to the full text version of the documents. The       directory structure will also be included with this abstract. It is       possible to create a different directory structure and will have to be       handled on an ad-hoc basis.\n\n      This scenario will be completed upon the supply of the final version of       the Blackwell/Munksgaard DTD.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstracts and PDF (Headers and PDF)\n\n      This type of export would use the same DTD as the abstracts only, but       would include a reference to the PDF file inside each header. This extract       would obviously also include the PDF files.\n\nFull Text Blackwell/Munksgaard DTD\n\n      This export will take the Blackwell/Munksgaard SGML files in full as well       as graphic files and PDF files.\n\nFull Text in Ovid's DTD\n\n      This export will convert the full text to Ovid's DTD and includes the       graphic files and PDF files.\n\nDelivery Options for Third Parties\n\n      Third parties will have the option to receive information via HTTP, FTP       (either sent to them or picked up), tape (4mm, 8mm, DLT) or CD-ROM.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Reporting - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      This section defines some of the reports available to       Blackwell/Munksgaard. It is expected that customization of reports will       continue to be refined over the duration of the project. This will allow       both HealthGate and Blackwell/Munksgaard to make necessary adjustments. As       a future direction HealthGate will provide direct access to the SQL       database (via ODBC or similar methods).\n\nUser\n\n      Each time an authorized user logs on, information regarding their usage,       purchases and transactions will be tracked. From this data, reports may be       compiled to include the following:\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BLACKWELL/MUNKSGAARD JOURNAL PUBLISHING                                       21\n\nUSER SCENARIOS                                                       INTEGRATION - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n      o     Last usage: This information indicates when the user last accessed             the system\n\n      o     Number of subscriptions per user: Will list how many subscriptions             and the title of each journal subscription that the user has bought\n\n      o     Number of documents delivered (excluding subscriptions): The number             of documents (such as full text articles, etc.) purchased by the             user will be reported\n\n      o     Number of documents read within a subscription: This will provide a             feature unique to the online medium; for the first time, editors             will be able to track which articles were viewed with the most             interest by their readers within a subscription.\n\n      o     Accounting of all charges: Reports will have the capacity to reflect             accounting of all accrued charges by subscribers, document delivery,             etc.\n\nContent\n\n      Each time an article is accessed by an authorized user, information       regarding usage, purchases and transactions will be tracked. These reports       could be grouped by abstract, article, issue, volume, journal and       publisher. From this data, reports may be compiled to include the       following:\n\n      o     Number of documents read by subscribers: The number of times each             document (full-text article) from a specific issue is accessed by             subscribers\n\n      o     Number of documents read by non-subscribers: The number of times             each document (full-text article) from a specific issue are             purchased by non-subscribers\n\n      o     Advertisements shown per issue: The specific advertisement and             number of times displayed from each issue.\n\n      o     Accounting of all charges: Reports will have the capacity to reflect             accounting of all accrued charges by subscribers, document delivery,             etc. associated with a specific issue\n\n      o     Title and number of subscriptions: The number of subscriptions for             each journal\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Integration - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHeathMill or Other Subscription Systems to HealthGate Connection\n\n\n\n\n\n      On a regular basis, the following information will be transferred to the       publishing system.

Here is the legal\nagreement to evaluate: Exhibit 10.1\n\nRedactions with respect to certain portions hereof denoted with \"***\"\n\nCOLLABORATION AGREEMENT\n\nThis Collaboration Agreement (the \"Agreement\") is made as of April 14th, 2020 (the \"Effective Date\") by and between Anixa Biosciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation, located at 3150 Almaden Expressway, Suite 250, San Jose, CA 95118, U.S.A. (\"Anixa\"), and OntoChem GmbH, a German limited liability company, located at Bl\u00fccherstr. 24, D-06120 Halle (Saale), Germany (\"OntoChem\"). Anixa and OntoChem are referred to herein individually as a \"Party\" and collectively as the \"Parties.\"\n\nWHEREAS, the Parties wish to collaborate in the discovery and development of novel drug candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises set forth in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:\n\n1. Defined Terms.\n\n1.1 \"Affiliate\" means, with respect to a Party, any entity directly or indirectly controlled by, controlling or under common control with such Party. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means (a) ownership of fifty percent (50%) (or such lesser percentage which is the maximum allowed to be owned by a foreign entity or investor in a particular jurisdiction) or more of the outstanding voting stock or other ownership interest of an entity, or (b) possession of the power to (i) elect, appoint, direct or remove fifty percent (50%) or more of the members of the board of directors or other governing body of an entity or (ii) otherwise direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of an entity by contract or otherwise.\n\n1.2 \"Hit Compound\" means any chemical entity that is determined in performing the Research Plan to meet the Hit Criteria.\n\n1.3 \"Hit Criteria\" means the criteria identified as \"Hit Criteria\" as set forth in the Research Plan.\n\n1.4 \"Invention\" means any invention, know-how, data, discovery or proprietary information, whether or not patentable, that is made or generated solely by the Representatives of Anixa or OntoChem or jointly by the Representatives of Anixa and OntoChem in performing the Research Plan, including all intellectual property rights in the foregoing.\n\n1.5 \"Representative\" means, with respect to a Party, an officer, director, employee, agent or permitted subcontractor of such Party.\n\n1.6 \"Research Plan\" means the research plan attached hereto as Exhibit A.\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7 \"SAR\" means the relationship between the chemical or three-dimensional structure of a compound and its biological activity, and includes the determination of the chemical groups responsible for evoking a target biological effect.\n\n1.8 \"Target\" means: (a) any protease of any coronavirus, including Mpro; (b) the Nsp15-pRB ribonuclease protein- protein interaction; (c) all mutants and variants of any molecule or component referenced in clauses (a) or (b); and (d) all truncated forms (including fragments) of any molecule or component referenced in clauses (a) or (b) or mutant or variant referenced in clause (c).\n\n1.9 \"Variant\" means, with respect to any Hit Compound: (a) all compounds within the genus of compounds to which such Hit Compound would belong under United States patent laws as referenced in the Selection Notice (as defined below); and (b) any base form, metabolite, ester, salt form, racemate, stereoisomer, polymorph, hydrate, anhydride or solvate of such Hit Compound or any other compound described in clause (a) (in the case of this clause (b), without regard to whether such compound is referenced in the Selection Notice).\n\n2. Research Program.\n\n2.1 Performance. The Parties will diligently perform their respective activities set forth in the Research Plan (such activities, collectively, the \"Research Program\") in accordance with the timelines set forth therein, with the objective of identifying Hit Compounds and Lead Scaffolds that modulate the applicable Target. Without limiting the foregoing, OntoChem will (a) provide all deliverables set forth in the Research Plan (each, a \"Deliverable\") and (b) obtain any authorizations, approvals and licenses required for performance of the Research Plan. If any terms set forth in the Research Plan conflict with the terms set forth in this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement will control unless expressly indicated to the contrary in the Research Plan. The Research Plan may not be amended without the prior written consent of both Parties. If, from time to time, the Parties desire to expand the scope of the Research Program, then they will negotiate in good faith a potential amendment of the Research Plan in regard to such expanded scope, on commercially reasonable terms, but neither Party will be obligated to enter into any such amendment.\n\n2.2 Weekly Updates. OntoChem will provide Anixa with weekly (or more frequently as requested) updates regarding its progress under the Research Program via teleconference, videoconference or e-mail, and the Parties will make appropriate personnel available in a timely manner to discuss and provide feedback in regard to such updates.\n\n2.3 Delivery of Data. In conjunction with each weekly update described in Section 2.2, OntoChem will deliver to Anixa all data generated under the Research Plan since the preceding update. In addition, Anixa will have the right to reasonably request additional information relating to such data, and OntoChem will respond to such requests promptly with any such additional information in its possession or control, provided that, for clarity, OntoChem will not be required to perform any new or additional research in order to generate any such additional information.\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Selection of Lead Scaffolds. Within one year following completion of all activities under the Research Plan (the \"Selection Deadline\"), Anixa, in good faith consultation with OntoChem, will have the right to select up to two hundred (200) Hit Compounds (each, a \"Selected Hit Compound\"), by providing OntoChem with written notice of such Selected Hit Compound(s) (the \"Selection Notice\"), and each Selected Hit Compound, along with all Variants of such Selected Hit Compound referenced in the Selection Notice, is hereby designated as a \"Lead Scaffold\" under this Agreement. Commencing upon selection of a Selected Hit Compound, Anixa (itself and through its Affiliates and designees) will have sole authority over and control of the further development, manufacture, and commercialization of the corresponding Lead Scaffold and any product candidate or product incorporating a compound from such Lead Scaffold. Following the Selection Deadline, Anixa will have no further rights with respect to any Hit Compound that is not a Selected Hit Compound or included within a Lead Scaffold (each, a \"Rejected Hit Compound\"), provided that, during the period of two (2) years following the Selection Deadline, neither OntoChem nor any of its Affiliates will use or disclose to any third party any Rejected Hit Compound or any Variant thereof, including the identity, structure or SAR information of any such compound, for application as anti-viral agents or protease inhibitors, for purposes of modulating any Target or for treatment of virus-related conditions. In case OntoChem finds a novel and unexpected antiviral use of those Rejected Hit Compounds during this 2-years period, it will notify Anixa about these findings and Anixa has the right of first negotiation during a period of 6 months after this notification. If Anixa decides to not license those uses or compounds for this novel antiviral use, OntoChem is free to develop those molecules further as its own intellectual property without any further restrictions.\n\n2.5 Subcontractors. OntoChem may engage one or more subcontractors to perform its activities under the Research Plan with the prior written approval of Anixa and provided that, with respect to any such subcontractor, OntoChem will (a) be responsible and liable for the performance of such subcontractor and (b) enter into a written agreement (i) consistent with terms and conditions of this Agreement, including with respect to confidentiality and intellectual property, and (ii) prohibiting such subcontractor from further subcontracting. For clarity, vendors where commercial building blocks or compounds will be purchased are nor regarded as subcontractors.\n\n2.6 Target Exclusivity. During the term of this Agreement, except in the performance of its obligations or exercise of its rights under this Agreement, neither OntoChem nor any of its Affiliates will discover, research, develop, manufacture or commercialize any compound or product directed to any Target, either independently or for or in collaboration with a third party (including the grant of a license to any third party), or have any of the foregoing activities performed on behalf of OntoChem or any of its Affiliates by a third party. For clarity, the foregoing includes the screening (including via computational methods) of any compound library or virtual compound library against any Target.\n\n2.7 Records. Each Party will maintain complete and accurate records of all activities performed by or on behalf of such Party under the Research Program and all Inventions made or generated by or on behalf of such Party in the performance of the Research Program. Such records will be in sufficient detail and in good scientific manner appropriate for patent and regulatory purposes. Each Party will provide the other Party with the right to inspect such records, and upon request will provide copies of all such records, to the extent reasonably required for the exercise or performance of such other Party's rights or obligations under this Agreement, provided that any information disclosed under this Section 2.7 will be subject to the terms and conditions of Section 5. Each Party will retain such records for at least three (3) years following expiration or termination of this Agreement or such longer period as may be required by applicable law or regulation.\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n2.8 Debarment. Each Party hereby represents and warrants to the other Party that neither it nor any of its Affiliates or personnel has been debarred under any health care laws or regulations and that, to its knowledge, no investigations, claims or proceedings with respect to debarment are pending or threatened against such Party or any of its Affiliates or personnel. Neither Party nor any of its Affiliates will use in any capacity, in connection with the Research Program, any person or entity who has been debarred. Each Party agrees and undertakes to promptly notify the other Party if such Party or any of its Affiliates or personnel becomes debarred or proceedings have been initiated against any of them with respect to debarment, whether such debarment or initiation of proceedings occurs during or after the term of this Agreement.\n\n3. Financial Terms.\n\n3.1 Research Program Payments. In consideration for OntoChem's performance of its activities under the Research Plan, Anixa will:\n\n(a) pay OntoChem 100,002 Euros in six (6) equal installments as follows: (i) 16,667 Euros within five (5) days after the Effective Date; and (ii) five (5) installments in the amount of 16,667 Euros on each one-month anniversary of the Effective Date, except that the last such payment will be due within thirty (30) days after completion of all activities under the Research Plan; and\n\n(b) reimburse OntoChem for its out-of-pocket expenses incurred in performing the Research Plan on a pass- through basis without mark-up, within thirty (30) days after delivery of an invoice therefore (including reasonable supporting documentation), provided that Anixa has approved such expenses in advance and in writing (including in regard to the selection of specific Hit Compounds to be synthesized and analyzed in biological assays). It is estimated that OntoChem's out-of-pocket expenses under the Research Plan will include 110,000 Euros payable to Tube Pharmaceuticals GmbH as a subcontractor of OntoChem, subject to Section 2.5.\n\n(c) High-throughput screening compounds\n\nOntoChem will forward a commercial proposal to acquire these compounds at the sole discretion of Anixa. Both parties will agree on payment conditions.\n\n(d) Extra custom synthesis\n\nOntoChem will forward a commercial proposal to have synthesized these compounds at the sole discretion of Anixa. Both parties will agree on payment conditions.\n\n(e) Biological testing\n\nOntoChem will forward a commercial proposal to have biologically test these compounds at the sole discretion of Anixa. Both parties will agree on payment conditions.\n\n3.2 Lead Scaffold Payments. For each Lead Scaffold selected by Anixa, Anixa will pay OntoChem an annual fee of 10,000 U.S. Dollars, payable within thirty (30) days following each anniversary of the date of the Selection Notice, until five (5) years after the first commercial sale of the first product incorporating a compound from such Lead Scaffold, subject to Section 4.3 with respect to any Terminated Scaffold (as defined below).\n\n3.3 Milestone Payment. Anixa will pay OntoChem a one-time milestone payment of 300,000 U.S. Dollars within thirty (30) days following the dosing of the first patient in the first human clinical trial for the first product incorporating a compound from a Lead Scaffold.\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Payment Terms. Payments to OntoChem will be made by check or by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account as designated in writing by OntoChem from time to time. Taxes (and any penalties and interest thereon) imposed on any payment made by Anixa to OntoChem will be the responsibility of OntoChem. The fees for the respective bank transfers will be borne by Anixa.\n\n3.5 Financial Records. OntoChem will maintain complete and accurate books and accounting records related to all out-of-pocket expenses incurred in performing the Research Plan. These records will be available for inspection during regular business hours upon reasonable notice by Anixa, or its duly authorized representative, at Anixa's expense, for three (3) years following the end of the calendar year in which such expenses are invoiced. If it is determined that Anixa has overpaid for any expenses passed through by OntoChem under this Agreement, OntoChem will promptly reimburse Anixa for the amount of such overpayment and, if such overpayment represents more than five percent (5%) of the corresponding amount due, OntoChem will pay Anixa's reasonable fees and expenses incurred in connection with such inspection.\n\n4. Term and Termination.\n\n4.1 Term. Unless earlier terminated in accordance with Section 4.2 or 4.3, this Agreement will be in effect from the Effective Date until completion of the Research Program.\n\n4.2 Termination by Anixa. This Agreement may be terminated by Anixa, without cause, upon at least thirty (30) days written notice to OntoChem.\n\n4.3 Termination of Lead Scaffolds. For each Lead Scaffold, if (a) neither Anixa nor any of its Affiliates, licensees or assignees has dosed the first patient in a human clinical trial for a product incorporating a compound from such Lead Scaffold by the fifth (5th) anniversary of the date of the Selection Notice, or (b) Anixa earlier provides written notice of termination of such Lead Scaffold referencing this Section 4.3, then such Lead Scaffold (each, a \"Terminated Scaffold\") will thereupon cease to be a Lead Scaffold under this Agreement and thereafter, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement: (i) Anixa will promptly assign to OntoChem all right, title and interest in and to any patents and patent applications owned by Anixa that claim such Terminated Scaffold (including the composition, use or manufacture thereof) and, following such assignment, OntoChem will exclusively control the filing, prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of such patents and patent applications; (ii) the identity, structure and SAR information of such Terminated Scaffold will be deemed to be the Confidential Information of OntoChem; (iii) Anixa will not owe any further annual fees under Section 3.2 for such Terminated Scaffold; and (iv) this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect.\n\n4.4 Termination for Cause. This Agreement may be terminated by either Party for material breach by the other Party, provided that the terminating Party has given the breaching Party written notice of the breach and at least sixty (60) days to cure the breach prior to the effective date of termination.\n\n4.5 Effects of Termination. Promptly following expiration or termination of this Agreement, OntoChem will provide Anixa with an invoice (including reasonable supporting documentation) for any pre-approved out-of-pocket expenses (including non- cancellable commitments) incurred by OntoChem in performing the Research Plan and not yet reimbursed by Anixa, and Anixa will pay such invoice within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof. In addition, if this Agreement is terminated prior to completion of the Research Program, OntoChem will promptly furnish to Anixa any Deliverable or other work product generated to date and not previously provided to Anixa, including work in process.\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n4.6 Survival. Expiration or termination of this Agreement will not affect the rights and obligations of the Parties that accrued prior to the effective date of such expiration or termination. The following provisions will remain in effect following expiration or termination of this Agreement and the Parties will continue to be bound thereby: Sections 2.4 (last three sentences), 2.7, 2.8 (last sentence only), 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 4.5, 4.6, 5, 6, 8 and 9.\n\n5. Confidentiality.\n\n5.1 Definition. \"Confidential Information\" means any information disclosed (directly or indirectly) by a Party (in such capacity, \"Discloser\") to the other Party (in such capacity, \"Recipient\") in connection with this Agreement whether in written, graphic, electronic, tangible or any other form. Confidential Information will not, however, include any information that: (a) was publicly known or generally available to the public prior to the time of disclosure by Discloser to Recipient; (b) becomes publicly known or generally available to the public after disclosure by Discloser to Recipient through no wrongful action or inaction of Recipient; (c) is in the rightful possession of Recipient without confidentiality obligations at the time of disclosure by Discloser to Recipient as shown by Recipient's then-contemporaneous written files and records kept in the ordinary course of business; (d) is obtained by Recipient from a third party without an accompanying duty of confidentiality and without (to Recipient's knowledge) a breach of such third party's obligations of confidentiality; or (e) is independently developed by Recipient without use of or reference to Discloser's Confidential Information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except as expressly provided in Section 4.3 with respect to a Terminated Scaffold, the identity, structure and SAR information of: (i) the Hit Compounds will be deemed to be the Confidential Information of both Parties until the Selection Deadline, provided that, during such period, Anixa (itself or through one or more third party service providers on its behalf under a written agreement consistent with terms and conditions of this Agreement, including with respect to confidentiality and intellectual property) may perform biological assays and other analyses to evaluate the Hit Compounds solely for purposes of selecting Lead Scaffolds pursuant to Section 2.4; (ii) the Lead Scaffolds will be deemed to be Anixa's Confidential Information commencing upon the date of the Selection Notice; (iii) the Rejected Hit Compounds will be deemed to be OntoChem's Confidential Information commencing upon the date of the Selection Notice, subject to the last sentence of Section 2.4.\n\n5.2 Non-Use and Non-Disclosure. Neither Party will use any Confidential Information of the other Party for any purpose except as reasonably necessary to fulfill its obligations or exercise its rights under this Agreement. Neither Party will disclose any Confidential Information of the other Party nor permit any such Confidential Information to be disclosed, either directly or indirectly, to any third party or its personnel without the other Party's prior written consent, except as expressly permitted hereunder. Each Party may disclose Confidential Information of the other Party to its Representatives who are required to have the information in order for such Party to fulfill its obligations or exercise its rights under this Agreement, provided that such Representatives are subject to legally binding non-use and non-disclosure obligations consistent with this Agreement, prior to any disclosure of Confidential Information to such Representatives. If Recipient becomes legally compelled to disclose any Confidential Information of Discloser, Recipient will provide Discloser prompt written notice of such disclosure obligation, if legally permissible, and upon request will reasonably assist Discloser in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy. If Discloser waives Recipient's compliance with this Agreement or fails to obtain a protective order or other appropriate remedy, Recipient will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required to be disclosed, provided that any Confidential Information so disclosed will maintain its confidentiality protection for all purposes other than such legally compelled disclosure.\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Maintenance of Confidentiality. Recipient will take commercially reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information of Discloser. Without limiting the foregoing, Recipient will take at least those measures that it employs to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature. Recipient will promptly notify Discloser in writing of any unauthorized use or disclosure, or suspected unauthorized use or disclosure, of Discloser's Confidential Information of which Recipient becomes aware.\n\n5.4 Confidential Terms. Except as otherwise required by applicable law or regulation, neither Party will disclose the existence or terms of this Agreement to any third party without the prior written consent of the other Party, except that (a) each Party may disclose this Agreement or its terms to its advisors and to existing and potential investors, acquirers, lenders and, in the case of Anixa, licensees on a reasonable need-to-know basis under circumstances that reasonably ensure the confidentiality thereof, and (b) Anixa may issue press releases, make investor and other public presentations and post content on its website from time to time regarding the existence and terms of this Agreement and progress regarding the development, manufacture and commercialization of Lead Scaffolds (including the identity of any permitted subcontractors under this Agreement), to the extent deemed appropriate for purposes of investor relations in its capacity as a publicly traded company and compliance with securities laws and regulations.\n\n5.5 Equitable Relief. Recipient agrees that any violation or threatened violation of this Article 5 may cause irreparable injury to Discloser, entitling Discloser to seek to obtain injunctive relief in addition to all legal remedies without showing or proving any actual damage and without any bond required to be posted.\n\n5.6 Return of Confidential Information. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, or upon written request, each Party will promptly return to the other Party, or upon written request of such other Party destroy, all materials containing such other Party's Confidential Information, provided, however, that the Recipient may retain in confidence (a) one archival copy of the Confidential Information of the Discloser in its legal files solely to permit the Recipient to determine compliance with this Agreement and (b) any portion of the Confidential Information of the Discloser which the Recipient is required by applicable law or regulation to retain. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the materials described above, the Parties will continue to be subject to the terms of this Section 5.\n\n6. Intellectual Property.\n\n6.1 Background Intellectual Property.

A Party (the \"Indemnitee\") that intends to claim indemnification under this Section 8 will promptly notify the other Party (the \"Indemnitor\") in writing of any claim, action or proceeding in respect of which the Indemnitee intends to claim such indemnification (each a \"Claim\"), and the Indemnitor will have the right to control the defense and/or settlement of such Claim, provided that the Indemnitee will have the right to participate, at its own expense, with counsel of its own choosing in the defense and/or settlement of such Claim. The Indemnitor will not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, enter into any settlement or agree to any disposition of the applicable Claim that imposes any conditions or obligations on the Indemnitee. The failure to deliver written notice to the Indemnitor within a reasonable period of time after the commencement of any such Claim will not relieve such Indemnitor of any liability to the Indemnitee under this Section 8 except to the extent such failure is prejudicial to the Indemnitor's ability to defend such Claim. The Indemnitee and its Representatives, at the Indemnitor's request and expense, will provide full information and reasonable assistance to the Indemnitor and its legal representatives with respect to the applicable Claim subject to indemnification. It is understood that only a Party may claim indemnification under this Section 8 (on its own behalf or on behalf of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives), and such Party's Affiliates and their respective Representatives may not directly claim indemnification hereunder.\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4 Insurance.

Miscellaneous.\n\n9.1 Relationship of the Parties. The Parties are independent contractors and nothing contained in this Agreement will be construed to place them in the relationship of partners, principal and agent, employer/employee or joint venturer. Neither Party will have the power or right to bind or obligate the other Party, nor will either Party hold itself out as having such authority.\n\n9.2 Use of Name. Neither Party will use the name, logo or trademark of the other Party in any advertising, publicity or other promotional activities without such other Party's prior written consent, unless such use is reasonably necessary to comply with applicable laws or regulations and subject to clause (b) of Section 5.4.\n\n9.3 Notices.

Any such arbitration will be conducted in English in the State of Delaware. The arbitrator may grant injunctive or other relief in such dispute or controversy. The decision of the arbitrator will be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator's decision in any court of competent jurisdiction. The costs of the arbitration, including administrative and arbitrator's fees, will be shared equally by the Parties. Each Party will bear the cost of its own attorneys' fees and expert witness fees. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a Party may seek a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction from any court of competent jurisdiction in order to prevent immediate and irreparable injury, loss or damage on a provisional basis, pending the selection of the arbitrator or pending the arbitrator's determination of the merits of any dispute pursuant to this Section 9.5.\n\n9.6 Severability. If any one or more provisions of this Agreement will be found to be invalid or unenforceable in any respect, the Parties will negotiate in good faith a valid and enforceable substitute provision that most nearly reflects the original intent of the Parties, and the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.\n\n9.7 Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may be amended or modified, and any of the terms of this Agreement may be waived, only by a written instrument executed by each Party or, in the case of waiver, by the Party or Parties waiving compliance. The delay or failure of either Party at any time or times to require performance of any provision will in no manner affect its rights at a later time to enforce the same. No waiver by either Party of any condition or of the breach of any term contained in this Agreement, in any one or more instances, will be deemed to be, or considered as, a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or of the breach of such term or any other term of this Agreement.\n\n9.8 Assignment.

Any assignment or transfer of this Agreement in violation of this Section 9.8 will be null and void. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.\n\n9.9 Entire Agreement. This Agreement represents the complete and entire understanding between the Parties regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior negotiations, representations or agreements, either written or oral, regarding such subject matter.\n\n9.10 Counterparts. The Parties may execute this Agreement in multiple counterparts, all of which together will constitute one instrument. Signatures to this Agreement delivered by facsimile or other electronic transmission (e.g., portable document format (PDF)) will be deemed to be binding as original signatures.\n\n(The remainder of this page is intentionally left blank.

Harpoon shall (a) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an exemption of such withheld amounts to the extent practicable under Applicable Law and (b) cooperate with AbbVie to obtain a reduction or refund of such withheld amounts.\n\n6.9 Indirect Taxes.

If either Party receives a copy of an application submitted to the FDA under subsection (k) of Section 351 of the PHSA (a \"Biosimilar Application\") naming a Licensed Product as a reference product or otherwise becomes aware that such a Biosimilar Application has been filed (such as in an instance described in Section 351(l)(9)(C) of the PHSA), such Party shall, within [***], notify the other Party so that the other Party may seek permission to view the application and related confidential information from the filer of the Biosimilar Application under Section 351(l)(1)(B)(iii) of the PHSA. If either Party receives any equivalent or similar certification or notice in any other jurisdiction in the Territory, either Party shall, within [***], notify and provide the other Party with copies of such communication. Regardless of the Party that is the \"reference product sponsor\" for purposes of such Biosimilar Application, (a) [***]; (b) AbbVie shall have the right to list any AbbVie Patents, Joint Patents, Product-Specific Patents, and, upon the written consent of Harpoon, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (taking into account, without limitation, the potential impact of such consent on Harpoon's platform technology and/or other products undergoing development or commercialization by Harpoon or its Third Party licensees and covered by such Harpoon Patents), other Harpoon Patents, insofar as they cover the Biosimilar Product as required pursuant to Section 351(l) (3)(A), Section 351(l)(5)(b)(i)(II), or Section 351(l)(7) of the PHSA, to respond to any communications with respect to such lists from the filer of the Biosimilar Application, and to negotiate with the filer of the Biosimilar Application as to whether to utilize a different mechanism for information exchange than that specified in Section 351(l) of the PHSA; and (c) [***] shall have the sole right to identify such Patents or respond to communications under any equivalent or similar listing in any other jurisdiction in the Territory.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.3, AbbVie shall be responsible for initiating and managing any biosimilar litigation relating to Licensed Compounds or Licensed Products worldwide. AbbVie shall have the first right to bring an action for infringement of the AbbVie Patents, Joint Patents, Product-Specific Patents and, upon the written consent of Harpoon, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (taking into account, without limitation, the potential impact of such consent on Harpoon's platform technology and/or other products undergoing development or commercialization by Harpoon or its Third Party licensees and covered by such Harpoon Patents), other Harpoon Patents, including as required under Section 351(l)(6) of the PHSA following the agreement on a list of patents for litigation under Section 351(l)(4) or exchange of Patent lists pursuant to Section 351(l)(5)(B) of such act, or as required following any equivalent or similar certification or notice in any other jurisdiction. If Harpoon decides pursuant to this Agreement not to allow AbbVie to include such other Harpoon Patents in a litigation against a biosimilar applicant for a biosimilar product, Harpoon shall not assert such Patent in any litigation against the same biosimilar applicant for the same biosimilar product without written approval by AbbVie. The Parties' rights and obligations with respect to the foregoing legal actions shall be as set forth in Sections 7.3.1 through 7.3.5; provided that within [***] of reaching agreement on a list of Patents for litigation under Section 351(l)(4) or exchange of Patent lists pursuant to Section 351(l) (5)(B), AbbVie shall notify Harpoon as to whether or not it elects to prosecute such infringement. Either Party shall, within [***], notify and provide the other Party with copies of any notice of commercial marketing provided by the filer of a Biosimilar Application pursuant to Section 351(l)(8)(A) of the PHSA, or any equivalent or similar certification or notice in any other jurisdiction.

The Parties agree to cooperate fully in any infringement action pursuant to this Section 7.3. Where a Party brings such an action in accordance with this Agreement, the other Party shall, where necessary, furnish a power of attorney solely for such purpose or shall join in, or be named as a necessary party to, such action. Unless otherwise set forth herein, the Party entitled to bring any patent infringement litigation in accordance with this Section 7.3 shall have the right to settle such claim; provided that neither Party shall have the right to settle any patent infringement litigation under this Section 7.3 in a manner that imposes any costs or liability on, or involves any admission by, the other Party, without the express written consent of such other Party. The Party commencing the litigation shall provide the other Party with copies of all pleadings and other documents filed with the court if doing so would not waive any privilege or violate any court order or Applicable Law, and shall consider reasonable input from the other Party during the course of the proceedings.\n\n7.3.6 Recovery. Any recovery realized as a result of such litigation described in Section 7.3.1, 7.3.2, or 7.3.5 (whether by way of settlement or otherwise) shall be first, allocated to reimburse the Parties for their costs and expenses in making such recovery (which amounts shall be allocated pro rata if insufficient to cover the totality of such expenses).

Subject to Section 11.2, AbbVie shall have the first right, but not the obligation, to defend and control the defense of any such claim, suit, or proceeding at its own expense, using counsel of its own choice. Harpoon may participate in any such claim, suit, or proceeding with counsel of its choice at its own expense. The assumption of the defense of a claim that may be subject to Section 11.2 by either AbbVie or Harpoon shall not be construed as an acknowledgment that Harpoon is liable to indemnify any AbbVie Indemnitee in respect of such indemnity claim, nor shall it constitute a waiver by Harpoon of any defenses it may assert against an AbbVie Indemnitee's claim for indemnification. Without limitation of the foregoing, if AbbVie finds it necessary or desirable to join Harpoon as a party to any such action, Harpoon shall, at AbbVie's expense, execute all papers and perform such acts as shall be reasonably required. If AbbVie elects (in a written communication submitted to Harpoon within a reasonable amount of time after notice of the alleged patent infringement) not to defend or control the defense of, or otherwise fails to initiate and maintain the defense of, any such claim, suit, or proceeding, within such time periods so that Harpoon is not prejudiced by any delays, Harpoon may conduct and control the defense of any such claim, suit, or proceeding at its own expense.

AbbVie may participate in any such claim, suit, or proceeding in the Territory with counsel of its choice at its own expense; provided that Harpoon shall retain control of the defense in such claim, suit, or proceeding. If Harpoon elects not to defend or control the defense of such Harpoon Patents in a suit brought in the Territory, or otherwise fails to initiate and maintain the defense of any such claim, suit, or proceeding, then solely with respect to Product-Specific Patents included in the Harpoon Patents, and subject to Section 7.5.2(b), AbbVie may request to conduct and control the defense of any such claim, suit, or proceeding at its own expense, with Harpoon's consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.\n\n(b) On and after the License Option Exercise Closing Date, AbbVie shall have the responsibility for and control over the defense of the validity, patentability and enforceability of Product-Specific Patents at AbbVie's sole cost and expense. Harpoon may participate in any such claim, suit, or proceeding in the Territory with counsel of its choice at its own expense; provided that AbbVie shall retain control of the defense in such claim, suit, or proceeding.

The other Party may participate in any such claim, suit, or proceeding in the Territory related to the Joint Patents with counsel of its choice at its own expense; provided that the Party who is prosecuting the Joint Patents at the relevant time shall retain control of the defense in such claim, suit, or proceeding. If the Party who is prosecuting the Joint Patents at the relevant time elects not to defend or control the defense of the Joint Patents in a suit brought in the Territory, or otherwise fails to initiate and maintain the defense of any such claim, suit, or proceeding, then the other Party may conduct and control the defense of any such claim, suit, or proceeding, at its own expense.\n\n7.5.4 Cooperation. Each Party shall assist and cooperate with the other Party as such other Party may reasonably request from time to time in connection with its activities set forth in this Section 7.5, including by being joined as a party plaintiff in such action or proceeding, providing access to relevant documents and other evidence, and making its employees available at reasonable business hours. In connection with any such defense or claim or counterclaim, the controlling Party shall consider in good faith any comments from the other Party and shall keep the other Party reasonably informed of any steps taken, and shall provide copies of all documents filed, in connection with such defense, claim, or counterclaim provided that doing so would not waive any privilege or violate any court order or Applicable Law. In connection with the activities set forth in this Section 7.5, each Party shall consult with the other as to the strategy for the defense of the Harpoon Patents and Joint Patents. Neither Party shall have the right to settle any claim, suit, or proceeding under this Section 7.5 in a manner that imposes any costs or liability on, or involves any admission by, the other Party, without the express written consent of such other Party.\n\n7.5.5 Relationship to Enforcement of Patents. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the defense to any challenge of validity, enforceability or patentability of any of the Harpoon Patents, AbbVie Patents, or Joint Patents that is raised in connection with or in response to an infringement action or a biosimilar litigation shall be controlled by the Party who controls that infringement action or biosimilar litigation, and such Party shall have the right to manage, resolve, settle or dispose any such challenge according to Section 7.3, provided that (a) with respect to any Harpoon Patents that are not Product- Specific Patents and are not involved in any biosimilar patent litigation, where AbbVie is the controlling Party in connection with an infringement action, AbbVie shall not resolve, settle or dispose of such action or litigation in any way that would admit liability on the part of Harpoon, or materially impact the validity, scope or enforceability of such Harpoon Patent, without Harpoon's prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (b) with respect to any Harpoon Patents for which Harpoon did not give its consent to include within a biosimilar litigation, and Harpoon is the controlling Party in connection with an infringement action involving such Patents, then Harpoon shall be the controlling Party in connection with the defense to any challenge of validity, enforceability or patentability of such Harpoon Patents, but shall reasonably consult with AbbVie in connection with any such defense, and shall consider in good faith AbbVie's reasonable comments in relation thereto.\n\n7.6 Product Trademarks.

All information exchanged between the Parties regarding the prosecution, maintenance, enforcement and defense of Patents under this Article 7 will be deemed to be Confidential Information of the disclosing Party. In addition, the Parties acknowledge and agree that, with regard to such prosecution, maintenance, enforcement and defense, the interests of the Parties as collaborators and Harpoon and licensee are to, for their mutual benefit, obtain patent protection and plan patent defense against potential infringement activities by Third Parties, and as such, are aligned and are legal in nature. The Parties agree and acknowledge that they have not waived, and nothing in this Agreement constitutes a waiver of, any legal privilege concerning Patents under this Article 7, including privilege under the common interest doctrine and similar or related doctrines. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent a Party has a good faith belief that any information required to be disclosed by such Party to the other Party under this Article 7 is protected by attorney-client privilege or any other applicable legal privilege or immunity, such Party shall not be required to disclose such information and the Parties shall in good faith cooperate to agree upon a procedure (which may include entering into a specific common interest agreement, disclosing such information on a \"for counsel eyes only\" basis or similar procedure) under which such information may be disclosed without waiving or breaching such privilege or immunity.\n\nARTICLE 8 PHARMACOVIGILANCE AND SAFETY\n\n8.1 Pharmacovigilance.

All indemnification claims in respect of a Party, its Affiliates, or their respective directors, officers, employees and agents shall be made solely by such Party to this Agreement (the \"Indemnified Party\"). The Indemnified Party shall give the indemnifying Party prompt written notice (an \"Indemnification Claim Notice\") of any Losses or discovery of fact upon which such Indemnified Party intends to base a request for indemnification under this Article 11, but in no event shall the indemnifying Party be liable for any Losses to the extent resulting from any delay in providing such notice. Each Indemnification Claim Notice must contain a description of the claim and the nature and amount of such Loss (to the extent\n\n- 59 -\n\nSource: HARPOON THERAPEUTICS, INC., 10-K, 3/12/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nthat the nature and amount of such Loss is known at such time). The Indemnified Party shall furnish promptly to the indemnifying Party copies of all papers and official documents received in respect of any Losses and Third Party Claims.\n\n11.4 Control of Defense.\n\n11.4.1 In General. Subject to the provisions of Sections 7.4 (if applicable), 7.5 and 7.6, at its option, the indemnifying Party may assume the defense of any Third Party Claim by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party within [***] after the indemnifying Party's receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice. The assumption of the defense of a Third Party Claim by the indemnifying Party shall not be construed as an acknowledgment that the indemnifying Party is liable to indemnify the Indemnified Party in respect of the Third Party Claim, nor shall it constitute a waiver by the indemnifying Party of any defenses it may assert against the Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification. Upon assuming the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying Party may appoint as lead counsel in the defense of the Third Party Claim any legal counsel selected by the indemnifying Party which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. In the event the indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver to the indemnifying Party all original notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party in connection with the Third Party Claim. Should the indemnifying Party assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, except as provided in Section 11.4.2, the indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the analysis, defense or settlement of the Third Party Claim unless specifically requested in writing by the indemnifying Party. In the event that it is ultimately determined that the indemnifying Party is not obligated to indemnify, defend or hold harmless the Indemnified Party from and against the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall reimburse the indemnifying Party for any Losses incurred by the indemnifying Party in its defense of the Third Party Claim.\n\n11.4.2 Right to Participate in Defense. Without limiting Section 11.4.1, any Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in, but not control, the defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; provided that such employment shall be at the Indemnified Party's own expense unless (a) the employment thereof, and the assumption by the indemnifying Party of such expense, has been specifically authorized by the indemnifying Party in writing, (b) the indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel in accordance with Section 11.4.1 (in which case the Indemnified Party shall control the defense), or (c) the interests of the Indemnified Party and the indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim are sufficiently adverse to prohibit the representation by the same counsel of both Parties under Applicable Law, ethical rules or equitable principles (in which case the Indemnifying Party shall control its defense and the Indemnified Party shall control the defense of the Indemnified Party).\n\n11.4.3 Settlement. With respect to any Losses relating solely to the payment of money damages in connection with a Third Party Claim and that shall not result in the Indemnified Party's becoming subject to injunctive or other relief, and as to which the indemnifying Party shall have acknowledged in writing the obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder, the indemnifying Party shall have the sole right to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss, on such terms as the indemnifying Party, in its sole discretion, shall deem appropriate. With respect to all other Losses in connection with Third Party Claims, where the indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 11.4.1, the indemnifying Party shall have authority to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss; provided that it obtains the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the indemnifying Party does not assume and conduct the defense of a Third Party Claim as provided above, the Indemnified Party may defend against such Third Party Claim. Regardless of whether the indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Third Party Claim, no Indemnified Party shall admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or dispose of, any Third Party Claim without\n\n- 60 -\n\nSource: HARPOON THERAPEUTICS, INC., 10-K, 3/12/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nthe prior written consent of the indemnifying Party. The indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement, compromise or other disposition of a Loss by an Indemnified Party that is reached without the written consent of the indemnifying Party.\n\n11.4.4 Cooperation. Regardless of whether the indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause each indemnitee to, cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and shall furnish such records, information and testimony, provide such witnesses and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith. Such cooperation shall include access [***] afforded to the indemnifying Party to, and reasonable retention by the Indemnified Party of, records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making Indemnified Parties and other employees and agents available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder, and the indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for all its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith, subject to refund if the Indemnifying Party is ultimately held not to be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party.\n\n11.4.5 Expenses. Except as provided above, the reasonable and verifiable costs and expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with any Third Party Claim shall be reimbursed on a [***] basis in arrears by the indemnifying Party, without prejudice to the indemnifying Party's right to contest the Indemnified Party's right to indemnification and subject to refund in the event the indemnifying Party is ultimately held not to be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party.\n\n11.5 Special, Indirect, and Other Losses.

APPOINTMENT.      -----------\n\n1.1  Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Airspan hereby appoints Distributor as an independent, exclusive distributor to assist Airspan in marketing the Airspan Products to customers in the Territory, and Distributor hereby accepts such appointment as of the Effective Date of this Agreement. Distributor's appointment as a distributor of the Airspan Products grants to Distributor only a license to resell the\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 1\n\nAirspan Products to Distributor's customers in the Territory, and does not transfer any right, title, or interest in any of the Airspan Software to Distributor.\n\n1.2  Distributor's relationship to Airspan is that of an independent contractor, and nothing in this Agreement shall constitute Distributor as the agent or employee of Airspan.  Distributor shall have no authority to accept any order or make any offer (except as herein stated), or execute any instrument or make any commitment on behalf of Airspan.  Specifically, without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing, Distributor agrees not to make any representation, guarantee, or warranty on Airspan's behalf concerning the Airspan Products, but will refer customers to Airspan's printed literature. Nothing contained in this Agreement is to be construed as a limitation or restriction upon Airspan in the sale or other disposition of any of its products to any person, firm, or corporation inside or outside of the Territory. Airspan will pay no commissions under this Agreement.  Distributor's compensation is to be obtained solely by the difference between the price Distributor pays to Airspan and the price Distributor charges its customers. The parties also acknowledge that this Agreement is not intended to create a joint venture or partnership between Airspan and Distributor.\n\n1.3  Distributor will use its best efforts to maintain and support the Airspan Products within the Territory by devoting such attention, time, and effort as may be reasonably necessary to fully develop the available market potential.  During the term of this Agreement, and for a period of three (3) months following the expiration or termination of this Agreement, Distributor agrees that neither it nor any organization or entity controlled or directed by it will, without Airspan's prior, written consent, represent a manufacturer or supplier of products similar in design or performance to or which are of such a nature as to be competitive with any products contained in the Airspan Products, nor will Distributor market or otherwise promote the sale of such products. Distributor will give Airspan thirty (30) days' prior, written notice of each new potential representation role being considered by Distributor, and Distributor will not undertake such representation without Airspan's prior, written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Except as\n\n\n\n\n\nprovided above, in no event will Airspan consent to Distributor's consultation for or representation of a manufacturer or supplier, which is directly or indirectly, a competitor of Airspan.\n\n1.4  Distributor shall maintain a place of business at the location specified in Section 21.10 where Distributor can be contacted by Airspan, customers, and prospective customers during regular business hours with a permanent mailing address and an accessible cellular telephone, and will provide Airspan with written notice promptly upon any change in address.  Distributor agrees to assume all of the expenses of this place of business, including rent, stenographic services, and all other expenses except as specifically assumed in writing by Airspan.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 2\n\n1.5  Airspan will provide Distributor with such commercial and technical assistance and training as may reasonably be necessary, in Airspan's sole judgment, to enable Distributor to effectively carry out its activities under this Agreement and, in connection therewith, to provide such sales promotional materials, as Airspan may deem appropriate.  Airspan will provide such technical support as is reasonable and necessary to maintain the product line as a viable competitor in the market.\n\n2.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.\n\nDistributor hereby represents and warrants as follows:\n\na.

Distributor's bank accounts have been established and operated in accordance with applicable legislation.  All transactions of Distributor required to be carried out through authorized banks have been so carried out.

Distributor will conduct or provide for      any training of its personnel which may be necessary to impart such      knowledge.\n\n3.5  Distributor and its staff will research the technical requirements and      specifications of the market for Airspan Products in the Territory and make      information known to Airspan such that Airspan may, at its discretion,      implement appropriate technical changes to the Products to enable them to      be sold in the Territory. Airspan acknowledges that, subject to a further      and separate Agreement, such changes may be implemented in the future by      Distributor, with the assistance of Airspan.\n\n- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 4\n\n3.6  Distributor agrees to purchase and stock a comprehensive inventory of      spare parts based upon the recommended list set forth in Schedule III to      this Agreement.\n\n3.7  Distributor agrees to provide to its customers' installation services      for all Airspan Products.

Distributor further agrees to provide all of the sales and support      functions set forth in this section at no charge to Airspan.\n\n3.10 Distributor agrees not to actively seek to promote, rent, lease, sell,      sublicense or authorize the rental, sale or sublicense of Airspan Products      outside of the Territory [without the prior written approval of Airspan],      but nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Distributor from renting,      selling or sublicensing the Airspan Products to customers outside of the      Territory in response to an unsolicited request from such customer.\n\n3.11 During the term of this Agreement Distributor agrees that neither it      nor any organization or entity controlled or directed by it will, without      Airspan's prior, written consent, represent a manufacturer or supplier of      products similar in design or performance to or which are of such a nature      as to be competitive with any products contained in the Airspan Products.\n\n3.12 The parties mutually agree that by April 30, 2000, the parties will      negotiate and execute a National Accounts Consulting Agreement whereby the      Distributor will receive consulting fees and commissions for the sale and      deployment of Airspan's products on a national basis.

Unless the context      otherwise requires, any term or expression which is defined in or given a      particular meaning by the provisions of the Incoterms shall have the same      meaning in this\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 9\n\nAgreement, but if there is any conflict between the provisions of the      Incoterms and this Agreement, the latter shall prevail.\n\n8.2 All risk of loss or damage to the Equipment and Software will pass to      Distributor on collection by the freight forwarder from Airspan. However,      Airspan will insure the Equipment against loss or damage in transit to the      agreed to location as set forth in the Purchase Order within the city      limits of the arrival airport as set forth in Paragraph 8.1.\n\n8.3 Title to the Equipment shall pass to Distributor on collection by the      freight forwarder from Airspan.\n\n8.4  If Distributor has any Airspan owned Equipment in its possession:\n\na.   Distributor shall ensure that Equipment is clearly marked as the      property of Airspan, and if asked, shall inform any third parties that the      Equipment is the property of Airspan;\n\nb.   Distributor shall not purport to create any security, mortgage, lien      or pledge over the Equipment, or otherwise deal with the Equipment without      Airspan's written consent;\n\n\n\n\n\nc.   In the event of any threatened seizure of the Equipment by any third      parties, and on termination or expiration of this Agreement, or any      Contract made pursuant to it, Airspan shall have the right, without      prejudice to any other remedy, to enter without prior notice any premises      and to repossess and take away or otherwise deal with the Equipment.\n\n8.5  The Software shall at all times remain the exclusive property of      Airspan, subject to the uses provided herein.\n\n8.6  Unless Distributor clearly advises Airspan to the contrary in      writing, Airspan may make partial deliveries on account of Purchase Orders.      Delay in delivery of any installment shall not relieve Distributor of its      obligation to accept said installment, provided that said delay does not      exceed sixty (60) days from Airspan's scheduled ship date and unless      Distributor has clearly advised Airspan to cancel the delayed installment      in writing at least fifteen (15) days prior to its revised planned shipment      date or its actual shipment date by Airspan.\n\n8.7  Airspan will use reasonable efforts to meet Distributor's requested      delivery schedules for Equipment and Software, but Airspan reserves the      right to refuse, or delay delivery to Distributor when Distributor's credit      is impaired,\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 10\n\nwhen Distributor is delinquent in payments or fails to meet other credit or      financial requirements reasonably established by Airspan, or when      Distributor has failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n8.8  Should orders for Equipment and Software exceed Airspan's available      inventory, Airspan will allocate its available inventory and make      deliveries on a basis that Airspan deems equitable, in its sole discretion,      and without liability to Distributor on account of the method of allocation      chosen or its implementation.  In any event, Airspan shall not be liable      for any direct, indirect, consequential, or special losses or damages      (including, but not limited to, loss of income or profit and loss of data)      that may be suffered by the Distributor or by any other person for failure      to deliver or for any delay or error in delivery of Equipment or Software      for any reason whatsoever.\n\n9.   TRADEMARKS AND COPYRIGHTS.\n\n9.1  Distributor acknowledges Airspan's exclusive right, title, and interest in and to any trademarks, trade names, logos and designations which Airspan may at any time have adopted, used, or registered in the United States of America and in the Territory (the \"Trademarks\"), and will not at any time do or cause to be done any act or thing contesting or in any way impairing or tending to impair any part of said right, title, and interest.  In connection with any reference to the Trademarks, Distributor shall not in any manner represent that it has an ownership interest in the Trademarks or registration(s) thereof, and Distributor acknowledges that no action by it or on its behalf shall create in Distributor's favor any right, title, or interest in or to the Trademarks.\n\n9.2  Distributor recognizes the validity of Airspan's copyright in any written material to which Airspan shall have made a claim to copyright protection, and Distributor specifically recognizes Airspan's exclusive right to copyright protection and/or registration of any translation of any advertising, promotional, or descriptive material furnished to Distributor by Airspan.\n\n9.3  Whenever Distributor refers to the Trademarks in advertising or in any other manner to identify the products, Distributor shall clearly indicate Airspan's ownership of the Trademarks and before distributing or publishing any advertising, descriptive, or promotional materials, Distributor shall affirmatively provide Airspan with an opportunity to inspect and approve such materials.\n\n9.4  Distributor agrees that when referring to the Trademarks, it shall diligently comply with all laws pertaining to the Trademarks at any time in force in the Territory.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 11\n\n9.5  Distributor shall promptly notify Airspan of any and all infringements, imitations, illegal uses, or misuses of the Trademarks which come to Distributor's attention.  Distributor also agrees that it shall not at any time take any action in the courts or before the administrative agencies of the Territory or otherwise to prevent the infringement, imitation, illegal use, or misuse of the Trademarks, it being clearly understood by Distributor that such action falls wholly within the authority of Airspan as sole owner of the Trademarks.\n\n9.6  Distributor agrees to render to Airspan all assistance in connection with any matter pertaining to the protection of the Trademarks, whether in the courts or before the administrative agencies of the Territory or otherwise, and to make promptly available to Airspan, its Distributors, and attorneys all of Distributor's files, records, and other information pertaining to the\n\n\n\n\n\nadvertising, promotion, and sale of the Airspan Products.  All assistance requested by Distributor in this paragraph shall be at AIRSPAN's expense.  This Expense includes costs, attorneys' and consultants' fees, and reimbursement of time spent by officers, agents and employees of Distributor.\n\n9.7  Distributor agrees and undertakes that it will not at any time, whether during the term of this Agreement or after its expiration or termination, adopt, use, or register without Airspan's prior, written consent any work or symbol or combination thereof which is similar to any of the Trademarks.\n\n9.8 In the advertising and sale of Airspan Products, Distributor may use the Trademarks in relation to those Airspan Products.  Distributor will not make or permit the alteration or removal of any tags, labels, or other identifying marks placed by Airspan on Airspan Products.  Distributor will not use or give any third party permission to use the Trademarks. Distributor will not use, or give any third party permission to use, the names \"Airspan Communications Ltd.\", \"Airspan Networks Incorporated\", \"ACL\", \"ANI\" or abbreviations or derivations thereof in Distributor's corporate titles, or in any way which might result in confusion as to Airspan and Distributor being separate and distinct entities. Distributor admits Airspan's exclusive ownership of the name \"Airspan Networks Incorporated\", \"Airspan Communications Ltd.\", \"ANI\", \"ACL\", and any abbreviations or derivations thereof and all of Airspan's Trademarks (whether registered or not).  Distributor shall not take any action inconsistent with Airspan's ownership of such Trademarks; therefore, Distributor shall treat all of Airspan's items distinctively (as to typography) and shall only use exact reproductions of all Airspan's symbols (including Airspan's logo).   Distributor shall not adopt or use any Trademark or product name which may be confusingly similar to any Airspan Trademark.  Distributor may use the Airspan logo as it appears on Airspan's letterhead.\n\n10.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND TRADE SECRETS.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 12\n\n10.1  In this Agreement, the term \"Confidential Information\" shall mean the information of Airspan disclosed to Distributor in connection with its performance under this Agreement, which is in written, recorded, photographic, machine-readable, or other physical form or oral information reduced to writing as soon as practicable after disclosure to Distributor, and which is conspicuously marked \"Confidential\", \"Proprietary\", \"Private\", or in any other manner indicating its confidential and/or proprietary nature.  Without limitation, Confidential Information includes:  (1) Airspan's software products, materials, data reports, programs, documentation, diagrams, and all related technical information; (2) all information relating to Airspan's business and products which is critical to Airspan's position in the marketplace, including future plans of Airspan relating to the fields of endeavor in which Distributor performs services for Airspan, the nature of certain work projects to which Distributor is exposed, and the identity of persons working on those projects; and (3) any improvements, enhancements, or modifications to the above made by or on behalf of Airspan during the performance under this Agreement which are provided, made available, or disclosed by or on behalf of Airspan to Distributor, or used by Airspan or any of Airspan's other Distributors in connection with their own sales activities.\n\n10.2  Trade secrets are confidential information that includes ideas, concepts, techniques, processes, inventions, knowledge, and know-how developed by Airspan which:  (1) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (2) is subject to the efforts of Airspan that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.  (This \"trade secret\" language comes from the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.)\n\n10.3  Distributor covenants and agrees that it will use the Confidential Information solely for the performance of services under this Agreement, and shall not disclose such Confidential Information to any other person (including Airspan employees in any other division, group, or entity), firm, or corporation.\n\n10.4  Distributor shall use the same degree of care in safeguarding the Confidential Information as it uses for its own confidential information of like importance, but no less than reasonable care.  Upon discovery of any disclosure or misuse of Confidential Information, Distributor shall endeavor to prevent any further disclosure or misuse.\n\n10.5  All Confidential Information shall remain the property of Airspan, and such Confidential Information and all copies thereof shall promptly be returned to Airspan upon request or, at Airspan 's option, destroyed, in which case Airspan shall be notified in writing when it has been destroyed.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 13\n\n10.6  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting to or conferring upon Distributor any rights, by license or otherwise, express or implied, in Airspan's Confidential Information, other than the right to use the Confidential Information for the purpose of this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n10.7  Any copies of the Confidential Information made by Distributor shall reproduce proprietary marking and legends included therein, but the provisions of this Agreement supersede any provisions of such legends inconsistent herewith.\n\n10.8  The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not be disclosed by Distributor to others, except with the prior, written consent of Airspan, or as may be required by law or as necessary to establish its rights hereunder.\n\n10.9  If, in connection with its performance, Distributor discloses to Airspan any ideas, developments, or inventions conceived or actually reduced to practice by Distributor prior to its performance hereunder, no relationship, confidential or otherwise, express or implied, is established with Airspan by the disclosure thereof.  With respect to any such disclosure, no obligation of any kind is assumed by nor may be implied against Airspan, its subsidiary, or associated companies unless a formal, separate, written contract regarding the subject of disclosure is consummated by the parties, and then the obligation shall be only as expressed in the separate contract.\n\n10.10  Distributor agrees that any breach of the provisions of this Section by Distributor or Distributor's personnel, agents, or subcontractors, or any third party providing products or services to Distributor will cause immediate and irreparable injury to Airspan and that, in the event of such breach, Airspan shall be entitled to injunctive relief and any and all other remedies available at law or in equity.\n\n10.11  After Distributor has received Airspan's Confidential Information and know-how, it will be impossible to segregate Airspan's knowledge and know- how from other knowledge acquired independently by Distributor.  Accordingly, during the performance of this Agreement and for three (3) months after termination of services under this Agreement, Distributor will not offer services to third parties which compete with the services provided by Airspan under this Agreement, or otherwise use the knowledge acquired from Airspan in order to compete with Airspan or its customers.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, Distributor is not precluded from any activities which concern product sectors or industries other than those that concern products or services similar to those offered by Airspan in connection with this Agreement.  Nothing in this paragraph will be construed to prevent Distributor from providing service to existing customers of Distributor which would result in their interruption of service to the public.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 14\n\n10.12 During the performance of this Agreement and for three (3) months after termination of services under this Agreement, Airspan will not offer products or services to third parties which compete with the products or services provided by Distributor under this Agreement, or otherwise use the knowledge acquired from Distributor in order to compete with Distributor its customers\n\n10.13 The obligations of this Section 10 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n11.  SOFTWARE LICENSE.\n\n11.1 Airspan grants Distributor, and Distributor hereby accepts, a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use, and to sublicense as set forth below, Software provided by Airspan hereunder only on a single System or unit of Equipment, as may be applicable.  No license is granted to use the Software on multiple Systems or in conjunction with Equipment furnished by a party other than Airspan, unless specifically agreed to in writing by Airspan.  Software licensed under this Agreement is defined as: (a) any digital instruction sequence or control data contained on any media, including but not limited to, any magnetic-, electronic-, optical-, or organic device, and the term Software shall include any enhancement, modification, extension, part, portion or expansion thereof or implementation or downloading from network of any of the foregoing, for use exclusively on a System or a unit of Equipment; and (b) all associated documentation used to describe, maintain and use the Software.\n\n11.2 Any Software provided to Distributor by Airspan will be treated as the exclusive property of Airspan, and Distributor will:  (a) treat such Software as Confidential Information under Section 10 of this Agreement; (b) utilize such Software or any portions or aspects thereof (including any methods or concepts utilized therein) solely on Systems or Equipment provided by Airspan; (c) forthwith return to Airspan all memory media, documentation and/or other material that has been modified, updated or replaced; (d) except to the extent permitted by applicable law not modify, disassemble or decompile such Software, or reverse engineer any portion of the Software or functioning of Systems or Equipment, or permit others to do so, without Airspan's prior written consent; (e) except to the extent permitted by applicable law not reproduce or copy such Software in whole or in part except for backup and archival purposes or as otherwise permitted in writing by Airspan; (f) not perform or release benchmarks or other comparisons of the Software; and (g) not remove any trademark, tradename, copyright, notice or other proprietary notice from the Software and Distributor shall be responsible for the conservation of the same on any back-up copy of the Software.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 15\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3 In the event of a breach of this license by Distributor, then Airspan may, in its discretion, terminate the license with immediate effect, whereupon Distributor shall return to Airspan all Software and copies thereof within ten (10) days.\n\n12        EXCUSABLE DELAY.\n\nAirspan shall not suffer any liability for non-performance, defective performance, or late performance under this Agreement due to causes beyond its control and without its fault or negligence such as, but not limited to, acts of God, war (including civil war), civil unrest, acts of government, fire, floods, explosions, the elements, epidemics, quarantine, restrictions, strikes, lock- outs, plant shutdown, material shortages, or delays in transportation or delays of its suppliers or subcontractors for like cause.\n\nIn the event of excusable delay as defined in the preceding sentence, then Airspan, upon giving prompt written notice to Distributor, shall be excused from such performance on a day-to-day basis to the extent of such prevention, restriction, or interference (and Distributor shall likewise be excused from performance of its obligations on a day-to-day basis to the extent Distributor's obligations relate to the performance so prevented, restricted, or interfered with), provided that Airspan shall use its best endeavors to avoid or remove such causes of non-performance and both parties shall proceed to perform with dispatch whenever such causes are removed or cease to exist.\n\n13.  TERM AND TERMINATION.\n\n13.1  This Agreement shall remain in effect for sixty (60) months from the Effective Date (the \"Initial Term\"). After the Initial Term, the term of the Agreement may be extended by a further period of five (5) years by mutual written agreement by the parties in the form of an amendment to this Agreement. If Distributor wishes to extend the term of the Agreement beyond the Initial Term, it  must notify Airspan in writing at least six (6) months prior to then end of the Initial Term. However, nothing contained herein shall be interpreted as requiring either party to renew or extend this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or of any other provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated prior to the expiration of its stated term as set forth below.\n\n13.2  Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time during the term of this Agreement if  either party fails materially to comply with any covenant, term, or provision of this Agreement, by written notice given to the other party not less than thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such termination. Either party's right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 13.2 may not be exercised unless said\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 16\n\nparty shall have given the other party written notice of the failure, and the other party has not cured the failure within the thirty (30) day period following notice from said party.\n\n13.3  This Agreement terminates automatically for just cause, with no further act or action of either party if:  (a) a receiver is appointed for Distributor or its property; (b) Distributor&sbsp;makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (c) any proceedings are commenced by, for, or against Distributor under any bankruptcy, insolvency, or debtor's relief law; or (d) Distributor is liquidated, dissolved, or otherwise terminates its activities.\n\n13.4 In the event of termination by either party for any reason, Distributor shall provide Airspan with lists of existing customers as well as other information necessary for an orderly changeover of representation in the Territory.\n\n13.5  Upon termination, Distributor shall immediately return to Airspan all Confidential Information, and Distributor agrees that neither it nor any company or organization controlled or directed by it shall divulge the contents of such material to any person at any time, notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.\n\n13.6 Airspan shall not be liable to Distributor for damages of any kind, including incidental or consequential damages, on account of the termination of this agreement in accordance with this section 13.  Airspan shall not be liable to Distributor on account of termination or expiration of this Agreement for reimbursement or damages for loss of goodwill, prospective profits, or anticipated orders, or on account of any expenditures, investments, leases, or commitments made by either party, or for any other reason whatsoever based upon or growing out of such termination or expiration.  Airspan will recognize payments due to Distributor for orders received up to ninety (90) days after the termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n\n13.7  Distributor acknowledges and agrees that: (a) Distributor has no expectation and has received no assurances that its business relationship with Airspan will continue beyond the states term of this agreement or its earlier termination in accordance with this section, that any investment by Distributor in the promotion of Airspan's Products will be recovered or recouped, or that Distributor shall obtain any anticipated amount of profits by virtue of this Agreement; and (b) Distributor shall not have or acquire by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise any vested, proprietary, or other right in the promotion of Airspan's Products or in any goodwill created by its efforts hereunder.\n\n\n\n\n\n13.8  This Section 13.8, as well as the provisions of Sections 9, 10, 11, 16, 17 and 18, shall survive the termination of this Agreement.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 17\n\n14.  WARRANTY.\n\n14.1 THE WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN SECTIONS 14 AND 15 OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE IN LIEU OF, AND Airspan HEREBY DISCLAIMS, ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED TERMS AND WARRANTIES OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\n14.2 Subject to Sections 14.3 and 14.4, Airspan warrants that the Equipment sold to Distributor under this Agreement shall, under normal use and service, be free from defects in materials and faulty workmanship, and that the Software licensed to Distributor under this Agreement shall conform in all material respects to Airspan's published specifications therefor. The warranty period for any item of Equipment and related Software shall be twelve (12) months from the date of delivery of such Equipment and related Software to Distributor as set forth in Paragraph 8.1 (hereinafter, this period of time shall be referred to as the \"Initial Warranty Period.\")\n\n14.3 Airspan's obligation and Distributor's sole remedy under this warranty are limited to the replacement or repair, at Airspan's option, of the defective Equipment or Software within the Initial Warranty Period. Airspan shall have no obligation to remedy any such defect if it can be shown that: (a) the Equipment or Software was altered, repaired, or reworked by any party other than Airspan without Airspan's prior written consent; (b) such defects were the result of Distributor's or a third party's improper storage, mishandling, abuse, or misuse of the Equipment or Software; (c) such defects were the result of Distributor's or a third party's use of the Equipment or Software in conjunction with equipment electronically or mechanically incompatible or of an inferior quality; or (d) the defect was the result of damage by fire, explosion, power failure, or any act of nature.\n\n14.4  In no event shall Airspan be obliged to provide on-site maintenance. Subject to the provisions of this warranty clause, defective parts or components must be returned by Distributor to Airspan's designated facility located within the contiguous 48 states in the United States, freight prepaid, within the Initial Warranty Period, and said defective parts will be repaired or replaced by Airspan at no charge to Distributor.  In connection with such return by Distributor, Distributor shall comply with Airspan's Return Material Authorization (RMA) procedures.  Risk of loss or damage to Equipment or Software returned to Airspan for repair or replacement shall be borne by Distributor until delivery to Airspan.  Upon delivery of such Equipment or Software, Airspan shall assume the risk of loss or damage until that time that the Equipment or Software being repaired or replaced is returned and delivered to Distributor. Distributor will pay all transportation costs for Equipment or Software shipped to Airspan for repair or replacement.  Airspan shall pay all transportation costs associated\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 18\n\nwith returning repaired or replaced Equipment or Software to Distributor unless there was no fault found (NFF), in which event, the Distributor shall pay such transportation costs, along with Airspan's then prevailing standard NFF charge.\n\n14.5  Airspan will charge Distributor for any maintenance carried out which is not covered by the warranties contained in Section 14.2 or Section 15 at Airspan's then prevailing standard rates for such services.\n\n15.  WARRANTY ON REPAIRED AND REPLACEMENT MATERIALS.\n\nAirspan warrants that, following repair or replacement, the repaired or replaced Equipment or Software by Airspan shall be free from defects in materials and faulty workmanship and that the Software will conform in all material respects to Airspan's published specifications therefor for ninety (90) days from date of shipment from Airspan to Distributor or until the end of the Initial Warranty Period, whichever is longer.\n\n16.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n16.1  WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO SECTION 16.4, NEITHER Airspan, NOR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, SHAREHOLDERS, OR AFFILIATES (Airspan AND SUCH OTHER PERSONS, THE \"Airspan PARTIES\"), SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO DISTRIBUTOR FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, INCOME, REVENUE OR DATA, OR INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PURCHASE ORDER PLACED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER COLLATERAL CONTRACT, OR FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE EQUIPMENT OR THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE THEREOF OR THE INABILITY TO USE THEM EITHER SEPARATELY OR IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER EQUIPMENT OR SOFTWARE, OR FROM ANY OTHER CAUSE, WHETHER CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY, ON GROUNDS OF FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OR OTHERWISE.\n\n16.2  Without prejudice to Sections 16.3 and 16.4, the liability of the Airspan Parties, taken as a whole, for each event or series of connected events\n\n\n\n\n\narising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any purchase order placed pursuant to this Agreement, or any other collateral contract, or from or in connection with the Equipment or Software or the use thereof, or the inability to use them either separately or in combination with other equipment or software, or from any other cause, whether caused by negligence, breach of contract, strict liability, breach of warranty, on grounds of failure of essential purpose, or otherwise, shall in no circumstance exceed the total amount payable by Distributor to Airspan under this Agreement for the provision of\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 19\n\nthe Equipment or Software which gave rise to the loss or damage or in connection with which the loss or damage was incurred.\n\n16.3  Airspan Parties, taken as a whole, shall be liable for physical damage to Distributor's property resulting from Airspan's negligence under or in connection with this Agreement up to a maximum aggregate amount of one million US Dollars (US$1,000,000).  And Distributor, taken as a whole, shall be liable for physical damage to Airspan's property resulting from Distributor's negligence under or in connection with this Agreement up to a maximum aggregate amount of one million US Dollars (US$1,000,000).\n\n16.4  Nothing in this Agreement shall exclude or in any way limit Airspan liability for death or personal injury caused by its negligence.\n\n16.5  Save as provided for in Section 17 Distributor shall indemnify and hold harmless and defend the Airspan Parties from and against all claims, demands, actions, suits, proceedings, writs, judgments, orders and decrees brought, made or rendered against them or any of them and all damages, losses and expenses suffered or incurred by them or any of them howsoever arising out of or related to the breach by Distributor of any of the terms of this Agreement. Airspan shall notify Distributor forthwith of any claim, demand, action, suit, proceeding, writ, judgment, order or decree falling within the scope of this Section 16.5 and shall permit Distributor sole conduct of the same and shall provide reasonable assistance in relation thereto, subject to appropriate defense by Distributor and the payment by Distributor of Airspan's reasonable costs and expenses.\n\n16.6  Distributor shall include, in its agreements with its customers pursuant to which Distributor supplies Equipment or Software, provisions pursuant to which such customers agree that the Airspan Parties shall have no liability for any of the types of damages referred to at Section 16.1 in connection with or arising from the Equipment or Software or the use thereof, or the inability to use them either separately or in combination with other equipment or software, or from any other causes.\n\n17.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS INDEMNITY.\n\n17.1 Airspan agrees to indemnify and hold Distributor harmless with respect to any suit, claim, or proceeding brought against Distributor by a third party alleging that Distributor's use of the Equipment or the Software, separately or in combination, as a whole or in part, constitutes an infringement of any patent or copyright or misuse of proprietary or trade secret information.  Airspan agrees to defend Distributor against any such claims and to pay all litigation costs, reasonable attorney's fees, settlement payments, and any damages awarded or resulting from any such claim.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 20\n\n17.2 Distributor shall promptly advise Airspan of any such suit, claim, or proceeding and shall co-operate with Airspan in the defense or settlement thereof.  Airspan shall have sole control of the defense of any action involving such a claim and of all negotiations for its settlement or compromise.\n\n17.3 In the event that an injunction is obtained against Distributor's use of the Equipment and/or the Software, in whole or in part, as a result of any such claim, Airspan shall use its best efforts to either: (a) procure for Distributor the right to continue using the portions of the Equipment or the Software enjoined from use; or (b) replace or modify the same with functionally equivalent or better Equipment and/or Software so that Distributor's use is not subject to any such injunction.  In the event that Airspan cannot perform the remedies set forth in Sections 17.3(a) or 17.3(b), then Distributor shall have the right to return such Equipment and the Software to Airspan.  In the event of such return, Airspan shall refund the depreciated value of the Equipment and the license to use the Software within thirty (30) days of the receipt by Airspan of the Equipment and the Software.\n\n17.4 This indemnity shall not apply to claims arising in respect to the use of the Equipment or Software supplied by Airspan or manufactured by its suppliers in accordance with any design or any special instruction furnished by Distributor, or which is used by Distributor in a manner or for a purpose not contemplated by this Agreement.\n\n17.5 The provisions of this Section 17 set forth the entire obligation of Airspan with respect to any claim of patent infringement, copyright infringement, or misuse of proprietary or trade secret information.\n\n18.  EXPORT CONTROLS AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE.\n\n\n\n\n\n18.1 If any approval with respect to this Agreement, or the registration thereof, shall be required at any time during the term of this Agreement, with respect to giving legal effect to this Agreement in the Territory, or with respect to compliance with exchange regulations or other requirements so as to assure the right of remittance abroad of United States dollars pursuant to Section 6 hereof, Distributor shall immediately take whatever steps may be necessary in this respect, and any charges incurred in connection therewith shall be for the account of Distributor.  Distributor shall keep Airspan currently informed of its efforts in this connection.  Airspan shall be under no obligation to ship Airspan Products to Distributor hereunder until Distributor has provided Airspan with satisfactory evidence that such approval or registration is not required or that it has been obtained.\n\n18.2 In the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, Distributor shall at all times strictly comply with all export laws, regulations, and orders of the\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 21\n\nUnited Kingdom and the United States of America.

APPOINTMENT.      -----------\n\n1.1  Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Airspan hereby appoints Distributor as an independent, exclusive distributor to assist Airspan in marketing the Airspan Products to customers in the Territory, and Distributor hereby accepts such appointment as of the Effective Date of this Agreement. Distributor's appointment as a distributor of the Airspan Products grants to Distributor only a license to resell the\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 1\n\nAirspan Products to Distributor's customers in the Territory, and does not transfer any right, title, or interest in any of the Airspan Software to Distributor.\n\n1.2  Distributor's relationship to Airspan is that of an independent contractor, and nothing in this Agreement shall constitute Distributor as the agent or employee of Airspan.  Distributor shall have no authority to accept any order or make any offer (except as herein stated), or execute any instrument or make any commitment on behalf of Airspan.  Specifically, without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing, Distributor agrees not to make any representation, guarantee, or warranty on Airspan's behalf concerning the Airspan Products, but will refer customers to Airspan's printed literature. Nothing contained in this Agreement is to be construed as a limitation or restriction upon Airspan in the sale or other disposition of any of its products to any person, firm, or corporation inside or outside of the Territory. Airspan will pay no commissions under this Agreement.  Distributor's compensation is to be obtained solely by the difference between the price Distributor pays to Airspan and the price Distributor charges its customers. The parties also acknowledge that this Agreement is not intended to create a joint venture or partnership between Airspan and Distributor.\n\n1.3  Distributor will use its best efforts to maintain and support the Airspan Products within the Territory by devoting such attention, time, and effort as may be reasonably necessary to fully develop the available market potential.

Distributor will give Airspan thirty (30) days' prior, written notice of each new potential representation role being considered by Distributor, and Distributor will not undertake such representation without Airspan's prior, written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Except as\n\n\n\n\n\nprovided above, in no event will Airspan consent to Distributor's consultation for or representation of a manufacturer or supplier, which is directly or indirectly, a competitor of Airspan.\n\n1.4  Distributor shall maintain a place of business at the location specified in Section 21.10 where Distributor can be contacted by Airspan, customers, and prospective customers during regular business hours with a permanent mailing address and an accessible cellular telephone, and will provide Airspan with written notice promptly upon any change in address.

Unless specified in the      Purchase Order, Airspan will select the mode of shipment and the carrier.\n\nIn this Agreement, \"Incoterms\" means the most recent international rules      for the interpretation of trade terms published by the International      Chamber of Commerce as in force on the Effective Date.  Unless the context      otherwise requires, any term or expression which is defined in or given a      particular meaning by the provisions of the Incoterms shall have the same      meaning in this\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 9\n\nAgreement, but if there is any conflict between the provisions of the      Incoterms and this Agreement, the latter shall prevail.\n\n8.2 All risk of loss or damage to the Equipment and Software will pass to      Distributor on collection by the freight forwarder from Airspan. However,      Airspan will insure the Equipment against loss or damage in transit to the      agreed to location as set forth in the Purchase Order within the city      limits of the arrival airport as set forth in Paragraph 8.1.\n\n8.3 Title to the Equipment shall pass to Distributor on collection by the      freight forwarder from Airspan.\n\n8.4  If Distributor has any Airspan owned Equipment in its possession:\n\na.   Distributor shall ensure that Equipment is clearly marked as the      property of Airspan, and if asked, shall inform any third parties that the      Equipment is the property of Airspan;\n\nb.   Distributor shall not purport to create any security, mortgage, lien      or pledge over the Equipment, or otherwise deal with the Equipment without      Airspan's written consent;\n\n\n\n\n\nc.   In the event of any threatened seizure of the Equipment by any third      parties, and on termination or expiration of this Agreement, or any      Contract made pursuant to it, Airspan shall have the right, without      prejudice to any other remedy, to enter without prior notice any premises      and to repossess and take away or otherwise deal with the Equipment.\n\n8.5  The Software shall at all times remain the exclusive property of      Airspan, subject to the uses provided herein.\n\n8.6  Unless Distributor clearly advises Airspan to the contrary in      writing, Airspan may make partial deliveries on account of Purchase Orders.      Delay in delivery of any installment shall not relieve Distributor of its      obligation to accept said installment, provided that said delay does not      exceed sixty (60) days from Airspan's scheduled ship date and unless      Distributor has clearly advised Airspan to cancel the delayed installment      in writing at least fifteen (15) days prior to its revised planned shipment      date or its actual shipment date by Airspan.\n\n8.7  Airspan will use reasonable efforts to meet Distributor's requested      delivery schedules for Equipment and Software, but Airspan reserves the      right to refuse, or delay delivery to Distributor when Distributor's credit      is impaired,\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 10\n\nwhen Distributor is delinquent in payments or fails to meet other credit or      financial requirements reasonably established by Airspan, or when      Distributor has failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n8.8  Should orders for Equipment and Software exceed Airspan's available      inventory, Airspan will allocate its available inventory and make      deliveries on a basis that Airspan deems equitable, in its sole discretion,      and without liability to Distributor on account of the method of allocation      chosen or its implementation.  In any event, Airspan shall not be liable      for any direct, indirect, consequential, or special losses or damages      (including, but not limited to, loss of income or profit and loss of data)      that may be suffered by the Distributor or by any other person for failure      to deliver or for any delay or error in delivery of Equipment or Software      for any reason whatsoever.\n\n9.   TRADEMARKS AND COPYRIGHTS.\n\n9.1  Distributor acknowledges Airspan's exclusive right, title, and interest in and to any trademarks, trade names, logos and designations which Airspan may at any time have adopted, used, or registered in the United States of America and in the Territory (the \"Trademarks\"), and will not at any time do or cause to be done any act or thing contesting or in any way impairing or tending to impair any part of said right, title, and interest.  In connection with any reference to the Trademarks, Distributor shall not in any manner represent that it has an ownership interest in the Trademarks or registration(s) thereof, and Distributor acknowledges that no action by it or on its behalf shall create in Distributor's favor any right, title, or interest in or to the Trademarks.\n\n9.2  Distributor recognizes the validity of Airspan's copyright in any written material to which Airspan shall have made a claim to copyright protection, and Distributor specifically recognizes Airspan's exclusive right to copyright protection and/or registration of any translation of any advertising, promotional, or descriptive material furnished to Distributor by Airspan.\n\n9.3  Whenever Distributor refers to the Trademarks in advertising or in any other manner to identify the products, Distributor shall clearly indicate Airspan's ownership of the Trademarks and before distributing or publishing any advertising, descriptive, or promotional materials, Distributor shall affirmatively provide Airspan with an opportunity to inspect and approve such materials.\n\n9.4  Distributor agrees that when referring to the Trademarks, it shall diligently comply with all laws pertaining to the Trademarks at any time in force in the Territory.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 11\n\n9.5  Distributor shall promptly notify Airspan of any and all infringements, imitations, illegal uses, or misuses of the Trademarks which come to Distributor's attention.  Distributor also agrees that it shall not at any time take any action in the courts or before the administrative agencies of the Territory or otherwise to prevent the infringement, imitation, illegal use, or misuse of the Trademarks, it being clearly understood by Distributor that such action falls wholly within the authority of Airspan as sole owner of the Trademarks.\n\n9.6  Distributor agrees to render to Airspan all assistance in connection with any matter pertaining to the protection of the Trademarks, whether in the courts or before the administrative agencies of the Territory or otherwise, and to make promptly available to Airspan, its Distributors, and attorneys all of Distributor's files, records, and other information pertaining to the\n\n\n\n\n\nadvertising, promotion, and sale of the Airspan Products.  All assistance requested by Distributor in this paragraph shall be at AIRSPAN's expense.  This Expense includes costs, attorneys' and consultants' fees, and reimbursement of time spent by officers, agents and employees of Distributor.\n\n9.7  Distributor agrees and undertakes that it will not at any time, whether during the term of this Agreement or after its expiration or termination, adopt, use, or register without Airspan's prior, written consent any work or symbol or combination thereof which is similar to any of the Trademarks.\n\n9.8 In the advertising and sale of Airspan Products, Distributor may use the Trademarks in relation to those Airspan Products.  Distributor will not make or permit the alteration or removal of any tags, labels, or other identifying marks placed by Airspan on Airspan Products.  Distributor will not use or give any third party permission to use the Trademarks. Distributor will not use, or give any third party permission to use, the names \"Airspan Communications Ltd.\", \"Airspan Networks Incorporated\", \"ACL\", \"ANI\" or abbreviations or derivations thereof in Distributor's corporate titles, or in any way which might result in confusion as to Airspan and Distributor being separate and distinct entities. Distributor admits Airspan's exclusive ownership of the name \"Airspan Networks Incorporated\", \"Airspan Communications Ltd.\", \"ANI\", \"ACL\", and any abbreviations or derivations thereof and all of Airspan's Trademarks (whether registered or not).  Distributor shall not take any action inconsistent with Airspan's ownership of such Trademarks; therefore, Distributor shall treat all of Airspan's items distinctively (as to typography) and shall only use exact reproductions of all Airspan's symbols (including Airspan's logo).   Distributor shall not adopt or use any Trademark or product name which may be confusingly similar to any Airspan Trademark.  Distributor may use the Airspan logo as it appears on Airspan's letterhead.\n\n10.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND TRADE SECRETS.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 12\n\n10.1  In this Agreement, the term \"Confidential Information\" shall mean the information of Airspan disclosed to Distributor in connection with its performance under this Agreement, which is in written, recorded, photographic, machine-readable, or other physical form or oral information reduced to writing as soon as practicable after disclosure to Distributor, and which is conspicuously marked \"Confidential\", \"Proprietary\", \"Private\", or in any other manner indicating its confidential and/or proprietary nature.  Without limitation, Confidential Information includes:  (1) Airspan's software products, materials, data reports, programs, documentation, diagrams, and all related technical information; (2) all information relating to Airspan's business and products which is critical to Airspan's position in the marketplace, including future plans of Airspan relating to the fields of endeavor in which Distributor performs services for Airspan, the nature of certain work projects to which Distributor is exposed, and the identity of persons working on those projects; and (3) any improvements, enhancements, or modifications to the above made by or on behalf of Airspan during the performance under this Agreement which are provided, made available, or disclosed by or on behalf of Airspan to Distributor, or used by Airspan or any of Airspan's other Distributors in connection with their own sales activities.\n\n10.2  Trade secrets are confidential information that includes ideas, concepts, techniques, processes, inventions, knowledge, and know-how developed by Airspan which:  (1) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (2) is subject to the efforts of Airspan that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.  (This \"trade secret\" language comes from the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.)\n\n10.3  Distributor covenants and agrees that it will use the Confidential Information solely for the performance of services under this Agreement, and shall not disclose such Confidential Information to any other person (including Airspan employees in any other division, group, or entity), firm, or corporation.\n\n10.4  Distributor shall use the same degree of care in safeguarding the Confidential Information as it uses for its own confidential information of like importance, but no less than reasonable care.  Upon discovery of any disclosure or misuse of Confidential Information, Distributor shall endeavor to prevent any further disclosure or misuse.\n\n10.5  All Confidential Information shall remain the property of Airspan, and such Confidential Information and all copies thereof shall promptly be returned to Airspan upon request or, at Airspan 's option, destroyed, in which case Airspan shall be notified in writing when it has been destroyed.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 13\n\n10.6  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting to or conferring upon Distributor any rights, by license or otherwise, express or implied, in Airspan's Confidential Information, other than the right to use the Confidential Information for the purpose of this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n10.7  Any copies of the Confidential Information made by Distributor shall reproduce proprietary marking and legends included therein, but the provisions of this Agreement supersede any provisions of such legends inconsistent herewith.\n\n10.8  The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not be disclosed by Distributor to others, except with the prior, written consent of Airspan, or as may be required by law or as necessary to establish its rights hereunder.\n\n10.9  If, in connection with its performance, Distributor discloses to Airspan any ideas, developments, or inventions conceived or actually reduced to practice by Distributor prior to its performance hereunder, no relationship, confidential or otherwise, express or implied, is established with Airspan by the disclosure thereof.  With respect to any such disclosure, no obligation of any kind is assumed by nor may be implied against Airspan, its subsidiary, or associated companies unless a formal, separate, written contract regarding the subject of disclosure is consummated by the parties, and then the obligation shall be only as expressed in the separate contract.\n\n10.10  Distributor agrees that any breach of the provisions of this Section by Distributor or Distributor's personnel, agents, or subcontractors, or any third party providing products or services to Distributor will cause immediate and irreparable injury to Airspan and that, in the event of such breach, Airspan shall be entitled to injunctive relief and any and all other remedies available at law or in equity.\n\n10.11  After Distributor has received Airspan's Confidential Information and know-how, it will be impossible to segregate Airspan's knowledge and know- how from other knowledge acquired independently by Distributor.  Accordingly, during the performance of this Agreement and for three (3) months after termination of services under this Agreement, Distributor will not offer services to third parties which compete with the services provided by Airspan under this Agreement, or otherwise use the knowledge acquired from Airspan in order to compete with Airspan or its customers.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, Distributor is not precluded from any activities which concern product sectors or industries other than those that concern products or services similar to those offered by Airspan in connection with this Agreement.  Nothing in this paragraph will be construed to prevent Distributor from providing service to existing customers of Distributor which would result in their interruption of service to the public.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 14\n\n10.12 During the performance of this Agreement and for three (3) months after termination of services under this Agreement, Airspan will not offer products or services to third parties which compete with the products or services provided by Distributor under this Agreement, or otherwise use the knowledge acquired from Distributor in order to compete with Distributor its customers\n\n10.13 The obligations of this Section 10 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n11.  SOFTWARE LICENSE.\n\n11.1 Airspan grants Distributor, and Distributor hereby accepts, a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use, and to sublicense as set forth below, Software provided by Airspan hereunder only on a single System or unit of Equipment, as may be applicable.  No license is granted to use the Software on multiple Systems or in conjunction with Equipment furnished by a party other than Airspan, unless specifically agreed to in writing by Airspan.  Software licensed under this Agreement is defined as: (a) any digital instruction sequence or control data contained on any media, including but not limited to, any magnetic-, electronic-, optical-, or organic device, and the term Software shall include any enhancement, modification, extension, part, portion or expansion thereof or implementation or downloading from network of any of the foregoing, for use exclusively on a System or a unit of Equipment; and (b) all associated documentation used to describe, maintain and use the Software.\n\n11.2 Any Software provided to Distributor by Airspan will be treated as the exclusive property of Airspan, and Distributor will:  (a) treat such Software as Confidential Information under Section 10 of this Agreement; (b) utilize such Software or any portions or aspects thereof (including any methods or concepts utilized therein) solely on Systems or Equipment provided by Airspan; (c) forthwith return to Airspan all memory media, documentation and/or other material that has been modified, updated or replaced; (d) except to the extent permitted by applicable law not modify, disassemble or decompile such Software, or reverse engineer any portion of the Software or functioning of Systems or Equipment, or permit others to do so, without Airspan's prior written consent; (e) except to the extent permitted by applicable law not reproduce or copy such Software in whole or in part except for backup and archival purposes or as otherwise permitted in writing by Airspan; (f) not perform or release benchmarks or other comparisons of the Software; and (g) not remove any trademark, tradename, copyright, notice or other proprietary notice from the Software and Distributor shall be responsible for the conservation of the same on any back-up copy of the Software.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 15\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3 In the event of a breach of this license by Distributor, then Airspan may, in its discretion, terminate the license with immediate effect, whereupon Distributor shall return to Airspan all Software and copies thereof within ten (10) days.\n\n12        EXCUSABLE DELAY.\n\nAirspan shall not suffer any liability for non-performance, defective performance, or late performance under this Agreement due to causes beyond its control and without its fault or negligence such as, but not limited to, acts of God, war (including civil war), civil unrest, acts of government, fire, floods, explosions, the elements, epidemics, quarantine, restrictions, strikes, lock- outs, plant shutdown, material shortages, or delays in transportation or delays of its suppliers or subcontractors for like cause.\n\nIn the event of excusable delay as defined in the preceding sentence, then Airspan, upon giving prompt written notice to Distributor, shall be excused from such performance on a day-to-day basis to the extent of such prevention, restriction, or interference (and Distributor shall likewise be excused from performance of its obligations on a day-to-day basis to the extent Distributor's obligations relate to the performance so prevented, restricted, or interfered with), provided that Airspan shall use its best endeavors to avoid or remove such causes of non-performance and both parties shall proceed to perform with dispatch whenever such causes are removed or cease to exist.\n\n13.  TERM AND TERMINATION.\n\n13.1  This Agreement shall remain in effect for sixty (60) months from the Effective Date (the \"Initial Term\"). After the Initial Term, the term of the Agreement may be extended by a further period of five (5) years by mutual written agreement by the parties in the form of an amendment to this Agreement. If Distributor wishes to extend the term of the Agreement beyond the Initial Term, it  must notify Airspan in writing at least six (6) months prior to then end of the Initial Term. However, nothing contained herein shall be interpreted as requiring either party to renew or extend this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or of any other provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated prior to the expiration of its stated term as set forth below.\n\n13.2  Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time during the term of this Agreement if  either party fails materially to comply with any covenant, term, or provision of this Agreement, by written notice given to the other party not less than thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such termination. Either party's right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 13.2 may not be exercised unless said\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 16\n\nparty shall have given the other party written notice of the failure, and the other party has not cured the failure within the thirty (30) day period following notice from said party.\n\n13.3  This Agreement terminates automatically for just cause, with no further act or action of either party if:  (a) a receiver is appointed for Distributor or its property; (b) Distributor&sbsp;makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (c) any proceedings are commenced by, for, or against Distributor under any bankruptcy, insolvency, or debtor's relief law; or (d) Distributor is liquidated, dissolved, or otherwise terminates its activities.\n\n13.4 In the event of termination by either party for any reason, Distributor shall provide Airspan with lists of existing customers as well as other information necessary for an orderly changeover of representation in the Territory.\n\n13.5  Upon termination, Distributor shall immediately return to Airspan all Confidential Information, and Distributor agrees that neither it nor any company or organization controlled or directed by it shall divulge the contents of such material to any person at any time, notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.\n\n13.6 Airspan shall not be liable to Distributor for damages of any kind, including incidental or consequential damages, on account of the termination of this agreement in accordance with this section 13.  Airspan shall not be liable to Distributor on account of termination or expiration of this Agreement for reimbursement or damages for loss of goodwill, prospective profits, or anticipated orders, or on account of any expenditures, investments, leases, or commitments made by either party, or for any other reason whatsoever based upon or growing out of such termination or expiration.  Airspan will recognize payments due to Distributor for orders received up to ninety (90) days after the termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n\n13.7  Distributor acknowledges and agrees that: (a) Distributor has no expectation and has received no assurances that its business relationship with Airspan will continue beyond the states term of this agreement or its earlier termination in accordance with this section, that any investment by Distributor in the promotion of Airspan's Products will be recovered or recouped, or that Distributor shall obtain any anticipated amount of profits by virtue of this Agreement; and (b) Distributor shall not have or acquire by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise any vested, proprietary, or other right in the promotion of Airspan's Products or in any goodwill created by its efforts hereunder.\n\n\n\n\n\n13.8  This Section 13.8, as well as the provisions of Sections 9, 10, 11, 16, 17 and 18, shall survive the termination of this Agreement.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 17\n\n14.  WARRANTY.\n\n14.1 THE WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN SECTIONS 14 AND 15 OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE IN LIEU OF, AND Airspan HEREBY DISCLAIMS, ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED TERMS AND WARRANTIES OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\n14.2 Subject to Sections 14.3 and 14.4, Airspan warrants that the Equipment sold to Distributor under this Agreement shall, under normal use and service, be free from defects in materials and faulty workmanship, and that the Software licensed to Distributor under this Agreement shall conform in all material respects to Airspan's published specifications therefor. The warranty period for any item of Equipment and related Software shall be twelve (12) months from the date of delivery of such Equipment and related Software to Distributor as set forth in Paragraph 8.1 (hereinafter, this period of time shall be referred to as the \"Initial Warranty Period.\")\n\n14.3 Airspan's obligation and Distributor's sole remedy under this warranty are limited to the replacement or repair, at Airspan's option, of the defective Equipment or Software within the Initial Warranty Period. Airspan shall have no obligation to remedy any such defect if it can be shown that: (a) the Equipment or Software was altered, repaired, or reworked by any party other than Airspan without Airspan's prior written consent; (b) such defects were the result of Distributor's or a third party's improper storage, mishandling, abuse, or misuse of the Equipment or Software; (c) such defects were the result of Distributor's or a third party's use of the Equipment or Software in conjunction with equipment electronically or mechanically incompatible or of an inferior quality; or (d) the defect was the result of damage by fire, explosion, power failure, or any act of nature.\n\n14.4  In no event shall Airspan be obliged to provide on-site maintenance. Subject to the provisions of this warranty clause, defective parts or components must be returned by Distributor to Airspan's designated facility located within the contiguous 48 states in the United States, freight prepaid, within the Initial Warranty Period, and said defective parts will be repaired or replaced by Airspan at no charge to Distributor.  In connection with such return by Distributor, Distributor shall comply with Airspan's Return Material Authorization (RMA) procedures.  Risk of loss or damage to Equipment or Software returned to Airspan for repair or replacement shall be borne by Distributor until delivery to Airspan.  Upon delivery of such Equipment or Software, Airspan shall assume the risk of loss or damage until that time that the Equipment or Software being repaired or replaced is returned and delivered to Distributor. Distributor will pay all transportation costs for Equipment or Software shipped to Airspan for repair or replacement.  Airspan shall pay all transportation costs associated\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 18\n\nwith returning repaired or replaced Equipment or Software to Distributor unless there was no fault found (NFF), in which event, the Distributor shall pay such transportation costs, along with Airspan's then prevailing standard NFF charge.\n\n14.5  Airspan will charge Distributor for any maintenance carried out which is not covered by the warranties contained in Section 14.2 or Section 15 at Airspan's then prevailing standard rates for such services.\n\n15.  WARRANTY ON REPAIRED AND REPLACEMENT MATERIALS.\n\nAirspan warrants that, following repair or replacement, the repaired or replaced Equipment or Software by Airspan shall be free from defects in materials and faulty workmanship and that the Software will conform in all material respects to Airspan's published specifications therefor for ninety (90) days from date of shipment from Airspan to Distributor or until the end of the Initial Warranty Period, whichever is longer.\n\n16.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n16.1  WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO SECTION 16.4, NEITHER Airspan, NOR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, SHAREHOLDERS, OR AFFILIATES (Airspan AND SUCH OTHER PERSONS, THE \"Airspan PARTIES\"), SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO DISTRIBUTOR FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, INCOME, REVENUE OR DATA, OR INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PURCHASE ORDER PLACED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER COLLATERAL CONTRACT, OR FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE EQUIPMENT OR THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE THEREOF OR THE INABILITY TO USE THEM EITHER SEPARATELY OR IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER EQUIPMENT OR SOFTWARE, OR FROM ANY OTHER CAUSE, WHETHER CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY, ON GROUNDS OF FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OR OTHERWISE.\n\n16.2  Without prejudice to Sections 16.3 and 16.4, the liability of the Airspan Parties, taken as a whole, for each event or series of connected events\n\n\n\n\n\narising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any purchase order placed pursuant to this Agreement, or any other collateral contract, or from or in connection with the Equipment or Software or the use thereof, or the inability to use them either separately or in combination with other equipment or software, or from any other cause, whether caused by negligence, breach of contract, strict liability, breach of warranty, on grounds of failure of essential purpose, or otherwise, shall in no circumstance exceed the total amount payable by Distributor to Airspan under this Agreement for the provision of\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 19\n\nthe Equipment or Software which gave rise to the loss or damage or in connection with which the loss or damage was incurred.\n\n16.3  Airspan Parties, taken as a whole, shall be liable for physical damage to Distributor's property resulting from Airspan's negligence under or in connection with this Agreement up to a maximum aggregate amount of one million US Dollars (US$1,000,000).  And Distributor, taken as a whole, shall be liable for physical damage to Airspan's property resulting from Distributor's negligence under or in connection with this Agreement up to a maximum aggregate amount of one million US Dollars (US$1,000,000).\n\n16.4  Nothing in this Agreement shall exclude or in any way limit Airspan liability for death or personal injury caused by its negligence.\n\n16.5  Save as provided for in Section 17 Distributor shall indemnify and hold harmless and defend the Airspan Parties from and against all claims, demands, actions, suits, proceedings, writs, judgments, orders and decrees brought, made or rendered against them or any of them and all damages, losses and expenses suffered or incurred by them or any of them howsoever arising out of or related to the breach by Distributor of any of the terms of this Agreement. Airspan shall notify Distributor forthwith of any claim, demand, action, suit, proceeding, writ, judgment, order or decree falling within the scope of this Section 16.5 and shall permit Distributor sole conduct of the same and shall provide reasonable assistance in relation thereto, subject to appropriate defense by Distributor and the payment by Distributor of Airspan's reasonable costs and expenses.\n\n16.6  Distributor shall include, in its agreements with its customers pursuant to which Distributor supplies Equipment or Software, provisions pursuant to which such customers agree that the Airspan Parties shall have no liability for any of the types of damages referred to at Section 16.1 in connection with or arising from the Equipment or Software or the use thereof, or the inability to use them either separately or in combination with other equipment or software, or from any other causes.\n\n17.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS INDEMNITY.\n\n17.1 Airspan agrees to indemnify and hold Distributor harmless with respect to any suit, claim, or proceeding brought against Distributor by a third party alleging that Distributor's use of the Equipment or the Software, separately or in combination, as a whole or in part, constitutes an infringement of any patent or copyright or misuse of proprietary or trade secret information.  Airspan agrees to defend Distributor against any such claims and to pay all litigation costs, reasonable attorney's fees, settlement payments, and any damages awarded or resulting from any such claim.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 20\n\n17.2 Distributor shall promptly advise Airspan of any such suit, claim, or proceeding and shall co-operate with Airspan in the defense or settlement thereof.  Airspan shall have sole control of the defense of any action involving such a claim and of all negotiations for its settlement or compromise.\n\n17.3 In the event that an injunction is obtained against Distributor's use of the Equipment and/or the Software, in whole or in part, as a result of any such claim, Airspan shall use its best efforts to either: (a) procure for Distributor the right to continue using the portions of the Equipment or the Software enjoined from use; or (b) replace or modify the same with functionally equivalent or better Equipment and/or Software so that Distributor's use is not subject to any such injunction.  In the event that Airspan cannot perform the remedies set forth in Sections 17.3(a) or 17.3(b), then Distributor shall have the right to return such Equipment and the Software to Airspan.  In the event of such return, Airspan shall refund the depreciated value of the Equipment and the license to use the Software within thirty (30) days of the receipt by Airspan of the Equipment and the Software.\n\n17.4 This indemnity shall not apply to claims arising in respect to the use of the Equipment or Software supplied by Airspan or manufactured by its suppliers in accordance with any design or any special instruction furnished by Distributor, or which is used by Distributor in a manner or for a purpose not contemplated by this Agreement.\n\n17.5 The provisions of this Section 17 set forth the entire obligation of Airspan with respect to any claim of patent infringement, copyright infringement, or misuse of proprietary or trade secret information.\n\n18.  EXPORT CONTROLS AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE.\n\n\n\n\n\n18.1 If any approval with respect to this Agreement, or the registration thereof, shall be required at any time during the term of this Agreement, with respect to giving legal effect to this Agreement in the Territory, or with respect to compliance with exchange regulations or other requirements so as to assure the right of remittance abroad of United States dollars pursuant to Section 6 hereof, Distributor shall immediately take whatever steps may be necessary in this respect, and any charges incurred in connection therewith shall be for the account of Distributor.  Distributor shall keep Airspan currently informed of its efforts in this connection.  Airspan shall be under no obligation to ship Airspan Products to Distributor hereunder until Distributor has provided Airspan with satisfactory evidence that such approval or registration is not required or that it has been obtained.\n\n18.2 In the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, Distributor shall at all times strictly comply with all export laws, regulations, and orders of the\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 21\n\nUnited Kingdom and the United States of America.

APPOINTMENT.      -----------\n\n1.1  Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Airspan hereby appoints Distributor as an independent, exclusive distributor to assist Airspan in marketing the Airspan Products to customers in the Territory, and Distributor hereby accepts such appointment as of the Effective Date of this Agreement. Distributor's appointment as a distributor of the Airspan Products grants to Distributor only a license to resell the\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 1\n\nAirspan Products to Distributor's customers in the Territory, and does not transfer any right, title, or interest in any of the Airspan Software to Distributor.\n\n1.2  Distributor's relationship to Airspan is that of an independent contractor, and nothing in this Agreement shall constitute Distributor as the agent or employee of Airspan.  Distributor shall have no authority to accept any order or make any offer (except as herein stated), or execute any instrument or make any commitment on behalf of Airspan.  Specifically, without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing, Distributor agrees not to make any representation, guarantee, or warranty on Airspan's behalf concerning the Airspan Products, but will refer customers to Airspan's printed literature. Nothing contained in this Agreement is to be construed as a limitation or restriction upon Airspan in the sale or other disposition of any of its products to any person, firm, or corporation inside or outside of the Territory. Airspan will pay no commissions under this Agreement.  Distributor's compensation is to be obtained solely by the difference between the price Distributor pays to Airspan and the price Distributor charges its customers. The parties also acknowledge that this Agreement is not intended to create a joint venture or partnership between Airspan and Distributor.\n\n1.3  Distributor will use its best efforts to maintain and support the Airspan Products within the Territory by devoting such attention, time, and effort as may be reasonably necessary to fully develop the available market potential.  During the term of this Agreement, and for a period of three (3) months following the expiration or termination of this Agreement, Distributor agrees that neither it nor any organization or entity controlled or directed by it will, without Airspan's prior, written consent, represent a manufacturer or supplier of products similar in design or performance to or which are of such a nature as to be competitive with any products contained in the Airspan Products, nor will Distributor market or otherwise promote the sale of such products. Distributor will give Airspan thirty (30) days' prior, written notice of each new potential representation role being considered by Distributor, and Distributor will not undertake such representation without Airspan's prior, written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Except as\n\n\n\n\n\nprovided above, in no event will Airspan consent to Distributor's consultation for or representation of a manufacturer or supplier, which is directly or indirectly, a competitor of Airspan.\n\n1.4  Distributor shall maintain a place of business at the location specified in Section 21.10 where Distributor can be contacted by Airspan, customers, and prospective customers during regular business hours with a permanent mailing address and an accessible cellular telephone, and will provide Airspan with written notice promptly upon any change in address.

Unless specified in the      Purchase Order, Airspan will select the mode of shipment and the carrier.\n\nIn this Agreement, \"Incoterms\" means the most recent international rules      for the interpretation of trade terms published by the International      Chamber of Commerce as in force on the Effective Date.  Unless the context      otherwise requires, any term or expression which is defined in or given a      particular meaning by the provisions of the Incoterms shall have the same      meaning in this\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 9\n\nAgreement, but if there is any conflict between the provisions of the      Incoterms and this Agreement, the latter shall prevail.\n\n8.2 All risk of loss or damage to the Equipment and Software will pass to      Distributor on collection by the freight forwarder from Airspan. However,      Airspan will insure the Equipment against loss or damage in transit to the      agreed to location as set forth in the Purchase Order within the city      limits of the arrival airport as set forth in Paragraph 8.1.\n\n8.3 Title to the Equipment shall pass to Distributor on collection by the      freight forwarder from Airspan.\n\n8.4  If Distributor has any Airspan owned Equipment in its possession:\n\na.   Distributor shall ensure that Equipment is clearly marked as the      property of Airspan, and if asked, shall inform any third parties that the      Equipment is the property of Airspan;\n\nb.   Distributor shall not purport to create any security, mortgage, lien      or pledge over the Equipment, or otherwise deal with the Equipment without      Airspan's written consent;\n\n\n\n\n\nc.   In the event of any threatened seizure of the Equipment by any third      parties, and on termination or expiration of this Agreement, or any      Contract made pursuant to it, Airspan shall have the right, without      prejudice to any other remedy, to enter without prior notice any premises      and to repossess and take away or otherwise deal with the Equipment.\n\n8.5  The Software shall at all times remain the exclusive property of      Airspan, subject to the uses provided herein.\n\n8.6  Unless Distributor clearly advises Airspan to the contrary in      writing, Airspan may make partial deliveries on account of Purchase Orders.      Delay in delivery of any installment shall not relieve Distributor of its      obligation to accept said installment, provided that said delay does not      exceed sixty (60) days from Airspan's scheduled ship date and unless      Distributor has clearly advised Airspan to cancel the delayed installment      in writing at least fifteen (15) days prior to its revised planned shipment      date or its actual shipment date by Airspan.\n\n8.7  Airspan will use reasonable efforts to meet Distributor's requested      delivery schedules for Equipment and Software, but Airspan reserves the      right to refuse, or delay delivery to Distributor when Distributor's credit      is impaired,\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 10\n\nwhen Distributor is delinquent in payments or fails to meet other credit or      financial requirements reasonably established by Airspan, or when      Distributor has failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n8.8  Should orders for Equipment and Software exceed Airspan's available      inventory, Airspan will allocate its available inventory and make      deliveries on a basis that Airspan deems equitable, in its sole discretion,      and without liability to Distributor on account of the method of allocation      chosen or its implementation.  In any event, Airspan shall not be liable      for any direct, indirect, consequential, or special losses or damages      (including, but not limited to, loss of income or profit and loss of data)      that may be suffered by the Distributor or by any other person for failure      to deliver or for any delay or error in delivery of Equipment or Software      for any reason whatsoever.\n\n9.   TRADEMARKS AND COPYRIGHTS.\n\n9.1  Distributor acknowledges Airspan's exclusive right, title, and interest in and to any trademarks, trade names, logos and designations which Airspan may at any time have adopted, used, or registered in the United States of America and in the Territory (the \"Trademarks\"), and will not at any time do or cause to be done any act or thing contesting or in any way impairing or tending to impair any part of said right, title, and interest.  In connection with any reference to the Trademarks, Distributor shall not in any manner represent that it has an ownership interest in the Trademarks or registration(s) thereof, and Distributor acknowledges that no action by it or on its behalf shall create in Distributor's favor any right, title, or interest in or to the Trademarks.\n\n9.2  Distributor recognizes the validity of Airspan's copyright in any written material to which Airspan shall have made a claim to copyright protection, and Distributor specifically recognizes Airspan's exclusive right to copyright protection and/or registration of any translation of any advertising, promotional, or descriptive material furnished to Distributor by Airspan.\n\n9.3  Whenever Distributor refers to the Trademarks in advertising or in any other manner to identify the products, Distributor shall clearly indicate Airspan's ownership of the Trademarks and before distributing or publishing any advertising, descriptive, or promotional materials, Distributor shall affirmatively provide Airspan with an opportunity to inspect and approve such materials.\n\n9.4  Distributor agrees that when referring to the Trademarks, it shall diligently comply with all laws pertaining to the Trademarks at any time in force in the Territory.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 11\n\n9.5  Distributor shall promptly notify Airspan of any and all infringements, imitations, illegal uses, or misuses of the Trademarks which come to Distributor's attention.  Distributor also agrees that it shall not at any time take any action in the courts or before the administrative agencies of the Territory or otherwise to prevent the infringement, imitation, illegal use, or misuse of the Trademarks, it being clearly understood by Distributor that such action falls wholly within the authority of Airspan as sole owner of the Trademarks.\n\n9.6  Distributor agrees to render to Airspan all assistance in connection with any matter pertaining to the protection of the Trademarks, whether in the courts or before the administrative agencies of the Territory or otherwise, and to make promptly available to Airspan, its Distributors, and attorneys all of Distributor's files, records, and other information pertaining to the\n\n\n\n\n\nadvertising, promotion, and sale of the Airspan Products.  All assistance requested by Distributor in this paragraph shall be at AIRSPAN's expense.  This Expense includes costs, attorneys' and consultants' fees, and reimbursement of time spent by officers, agents and employees of Distributor.\n\n9.7  Distributor agrees and undertakes that it will not at any time, whether during the term of this Agreement or after its expiration or termination, adopt, use, or register without Airspan's prior, written consent any work or symbol or combination thereof which is similar to any of the Trademarks.\n\n9.8 In the advertising and sale of Airspan Products, Distributor may use the Trademarks in relation to those Airspan Products.  Distributor will not make or permit the alteration or removal of any tags, labels, or other identifying marks placed by Airspan on Airspan Products.  Distributor will not use or give any third party permission to use the Trademarks. Distributor will not use, or give any third party permission to use, the names \"Airspan Communications Ltd.\", \"Airspan Networks Incorporated\", \"ACL\", \"ANI\" or abbreviations or derivations thereof in Distributor's corporate titles, or in any way which might result in confusion as to Airspan and Distributor being separate and distinct entities. Distributor admits Airspan's exclusive ownership of the name \"Airspan Networks Incorporated\", \"Airspan Communications Ltd.\", \"ANI\", \"ACL\", and any abbreviations or derivations thereof and all of Airspan's Trademarks (whether registered or not).  Distributor shall not take any action inconsistent with Airspan's ownership of such Trademarks; therefore, Distributor shall treat all of Airspan's items distinctively (as to typography) and shall only use exact reproductions of all Airspan's symbols (including Airspan's logo).   Distributor shall not adopt or use any Trademark or product name which may be confusingly similar to any Airspan Trademark.  Distributor may use the Airspan logo as it appears on Airspan's letterhead.\n\n10.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND TRADE SECRETS.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 12\n\n10.1  In this Agreement, the term \"Confidential Information\" shall mean the information of Airspan disclosed to Distributor in connection with its performance under this Agreement, which is in written, recorded, photographic, machine-readable, or other physical form or oral information reduced to writing as soon as practicable after disclosure to Distributor, and which is conspicuously marked \"Confidential\", \"Proprietary\", \"Private\", or in any other manner indicating its confidential and/or proprietary nature.  Without limitation, Confidential Information includes:  (1) Airspan's software products, materials, data reports, programs, documentation, diagrams, and all related technical information; (2) all information relating to Airspan's business and products which is critical to Airspan's position in the marketplace, including future plans of Airspan relating to the fields of endeavor in which Distributor performs services for Airspan, the nature of certain work projects to which Distributor is exposed, and the identity of persons working on those projects; and (3) any improvements, enhancements, or modifications to the above made by or on behalf of Airspan during the performance under this Agreement which are provided, made available, or disclosed by or on behalf of Airspan to Distributor, or used by Airspan or any of Airspan's other Distributors in connection with their own sales activities.\n\n10.2  Trade secrets are confidential information that includes ideas, concepts, techniques, processes, inventions, knowledge, and know-how developed by Airspan which:  (1) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (2) is subject to the efforts of Airspan that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.  (This \"trade secret\" language comes from the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.)\n\n10.3  Distributor covenants and agrees that it will use the Confidential Information solely for the performance of services under this Agreement, and shall not disclose such Confidential Information to any other person (including Airspan employees in any other division, group, or entity), firm, or corporation.\n\n10.4  Distributor shall use the same degree of care in safeguarding the Confidential Information as it uses for its own confidential information of like importance, but no less than reasonable care.  Upon discovery of any disclosure or misuse of Confidential Information, Distributor shall endeavor to prevent any further disclosure or misuse.\n\n10.5  All Confidential Information shall remain the property of Airspan, and such Confidential Information and all copies thereof shall promptly be returned to Airspan upon request or, at Airspan 's option, destroyed, in which case Airspan shall be notified in writing when it has been destroyed.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 13\n\n10.6  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting to or conferring upon Distributor any rights, by license or otherwise, express or implied, in Airspan's Confidential Information, other than the right to use the Confidential Information for the purpose of this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n10.7  Any copies of the Confidential Information made by Distributor shall reproduce proprietary marking and legends included therein, but the provisions of this Agreement supersede any provisions of such legends inconsistent herewith.\n\n10.8  The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not be disclosed by Distributor to others, except with the prior, written consent of Airspan, or as may be required by law or as necessary to establish its rights hereunder.\n\n10.9  If, in connection with its performance, Distributor discloses to Airspan any ideas, developments, or inventions conceived or actually reduced to practice by Distributor prior to its performance hereunder, no relationship, confidential or otherwise, express or implied, is established with Airspan by the disclosure thereof.  With respect to any such disclosure, no obligation of any kind is assumed by nor may be implied against Airspan, its subsidiary, or associated companies unless a formal, separate, written contract regarding the subject of disclosure is consummated by the parties, and then the obligation shall be only as expressed in the separate contract.\n\n10.10  Distributor agrees that any breach of the provisions of this Section by Distributor or Distributor's personnel, agents, or subcontractors, or any third party providing products or services to Distributor will cause immediate and irreparable injury to Airspan and that, in the event of such breach, Airspan shall be entitled to injunctive relief and any and all other remedies available at law or in equity.\n\n10.11  After Distributor has received Airspan's Confidential Information and know-how, it will be impossible to segregate Airspan's knowledge and know- how from other knowledge acquired independently by Distributor.  Accordingly, during the performance of this Agreement and for three (3) months after termination of services under this Agreement, Distributor will not offer services to third parties which compete with the services provided by Airspan under this Agreement, or otherwise use the knowledge acquired from Airspan in order to compete with Airspan or its customers.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, Distributor is not precluded from any activities which concern product sectors or industries other than those that concern products or services similar to those offered by Airspan in connection with this Agreement.  Nothing in this paragraph will be construed to prevent Distributor from providing service to existing customers of Distributor which would result in their interruption of service to the public.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 14\n\n10.12 During the performance of this Agreement and for three (3) months after termination of services under this Agreement, Airspan will not offer products or services to third parties which compete with the products or services provided by Distributor under this Agreement, or otherwise use the knowledge acquired from Distributor in order to compete with Distributor its customers\n\n10.13 The obligations of this Section 10 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n11.  SOFTWARE LICENSE.\n\n11.1 Airspan grants Distributor, and Distributor hereby accepts, a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use, and to sublicense as set forth below, Software provided by Airspan hereunder only on a single System or unit of Equipment, as may be applicable.  No license is granted to use the Software on multiple Systems or in conjunction with Equipment furnished by a party other than Airspan, unless specifically agreed to in writing by Airspan.  Software licensed under this Agreement is defined as: (a) any digital instruction sequence or control data contained on any media, including but not limited to, any magnetic-, electronic-, optical-, or organic device, and the term Software shall include any enhancement, modification, extension, part, portion or expansion thereof or implementation or downloading from network of any of the foregoing, for use exclusively on a System or a unit of Equipment; and (b) all associated documentation used to describe, maintain and use the Software.\n\n11.2 Any Software provided to Distributor by Airspan will be treated as the exclusive property of Airspan, and Distributor will:  (a) treat such Software as Confidential Information under Section 10 of this Agreement; (b) utilize such Software or any portions or aspects thereof (including any methods or concepts utilized therein) solely on Systems or Equipment provided by Airspan; (c) forthwith return to Airspan all memory media, documentation and/or other material that has been modified, updated or replaced; (d) except to the extent permitted by applicable law not modify, disassemble or decompile such Software, or reverse engineer any portion of the Software or functioning of Systems or Equipment, or permit others to do so, without Airspan's prior written consent; (e) except to the extent permitted by applicable law not reproduce or copy such Software in whole or in part except for backup and archival purposes or as otherwise permitted in writing by Airspan; (f) not perform or release benchmarks or other comparisons of the Software; and (g) not remove any trademark, tradename, copyright, notice or other proprietary notice from the Software and Distributor shall be responsible for the conservation of the same on any back-up copy of the Software.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 15\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3 In the event of a breach of this license by Distributor, then Airspan may, in its discretion, terminate the license with immediate effect, whereupon Distributor shall return to Airspan all Software and copies thereof within ten (10) days.\n\n12        EXCUSABLE DELAY.\n\nAirspan shall not suffer any liability for non-performance, defective performance, or late performance under this Agreement due to causes beyond its control and without its fault or negligence such as, but not limited to, acts of God, war (including civil war), civil unrest, acts of government, fire, floods, explosions, the elements, epidemics, quarantine, restrictions, strikes, lock- outs, plant shutdown, material shortages, or delays in transportation or delays of its suppliers or subcontractors for like cause.\n\nIn the event of excusable delay as defined in the preceding sentence, then Airspan, upon giving prompt written notice to Distributor, shall be excused from such performance on a day-to-day basis to the extent of such prevention, restriction, or interference (and Distributor shall likewise be excused from performance of its obligations on a day-to-day basis to the extent Distributor's obligations relate to the performance so prevented, restricted, or interfered with), provided that Airspan shall use its best endeavors to avoid or remove such causes of non-performance and both parties shall proceed to perform with dispatch whenever such causes are removed or cease to exist.\n\n13.  TERM AND TERMINATION.\n\n13.1  This Agreement shall remain in effect for sixty (60) months from the Effective Date (the \"Initial Term\"). After the Initial Term, the term of the Agreement may be extended by a further period of five (5) years by mutual written agreement by the parties in the form of an amendment to this Agreement. If Distributor wishes to extend the term of the Agreement beyond the Initial Term, it  must notify Airspan in writing at least six (6) months prior to then end of the Initial Term. However, nothing contained herein shall be interpreted as requiring either party to renew or extend this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or of any other provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated prior to the expiration of its stated term as set forth below.\n\n13.2  Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time during the term of this Agreement if  either party fails materially to comply with any covenant, term, or provision of this Agreement, by written notice given to the other party not less than thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such termination. Either party's right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 13.2 may not be exercised unless said\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 16\n\nparty shall have given the other party written notice of the failure, and the other party has not cured the failure within the thirty (30) day period following notice from said party.\n\n13.3  This Agreement terminates automatically for just cause, with no further act or action of either party if:  (a) a receiver is appointed for Distributor or its property; (b) Distributor&sbsp;makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (c) any proceedings are commenced by, for, or against Distributor under any bankruptcy, insolvency, or debtor's relief law; or (d) Distributor is liquidated, dissolved, or otherwise terminates its activities.\n\n13.4 In the event of termination by either party for any reason, Distributor shall provide Airspan with lists of existing customers as well as other information necessary for an orderly changeover of representation in the Territory.\n\n13.5  Upon termination, Distributor shall immediately return to Airspan all Confidential Information, and Distributor agrees that neither it nor any company or organization controlled or directed by it shall divulge the contents of such material to any person at any time, notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.\n\n13.6 Airspan shall not be liable to Distributor for damages of any kind, including incidental or consequential damages, on account of the termination of this agreement in accordance with this section 13.  Airspan shall not be liable to Distributor on account of termination or expiration of this Agreement for reimbursement or damages for loss of goodwill, prospective profits, or anticipated orders, or on account of any expenditures, investments, leases, or commitments made by either party, or for any other reason whatsoever based upon or growing out of such termination or expiration.  Airspan will recognize payments due to Distributor for orders received up to ninety (90) days after the termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n\n13.7  Distributor acknowledges and agrees that: (a) Distributor has no expectation and has received no assurances that its business relationship with Airspan will continue beyond the states term of this agreement or its earlier termination in accordance with this section, that any investment by Distributor in the promotion of Airspan's Products will be recovered or recouped, or that Distributor shall obtain any anticipated amount of profits by virtue of this Agreement; and (b) Distributor shall not have or acquire by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise any vested, proprietary, or other right in the promotion of Airspan's Products or in any goodwill created by its efforts hereunder.\n\n\n\n\n\n13.8  This Section 13.8, as well as the provisions of Sections 9, 10, 11, 16, 17 and 18, shall survive the termination of this Agreement.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 17\n\n14.  WARRANTY.\n\n14.1 THE WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN SECTIONS 14 AND 15 OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE IN LIEU OF, AND Airspan HEREBY DISCLAIMS, ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED TERMS AND WARRANTIES OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\n14.2 Subject to Sections 14.3 and 14.4, Airspan warrants that the Equipment sold to Distributor under this Agreement shall, under normal use and service, be free from defects in materials and faulty workmanship, and that the Software licensed to Distributor under this Agreement shall conform in all material respects to Airspan's published specifications therefor. The warranty period for any item of Equipment and related Software shall be twelve (12) months from the date of delivery of such Equipment and related Software to Distributor as set forth in Paragraph 8.1 (hereinafter, this period of time shall be referred to as the \"Initial Warranty Period.\")\n\n14.3 Airspan's obligation and Distributor's sole remedy under this warranty are limited to the replacement or repair, at Airspan's option, of the defective Equipment or Software within the Initial Warranty Period. Airspan shall have no obligation to remedy any such defect if it can be shown that: (a) the Equipment or Software was altered, repaired, or reworked by any party other than Airspan without Airspan's prior written consent; (b) such defects were the result of Distributor's or a third party's improper storage, mishandling, abuse, or misuse of the Equipment or Software; (c) such defects were the result of Distributor's or a third party's use of the Equipment or Software in conjunction with equipment electronically or mechanically incompatible or of an inferior quality; or (d) the defect was the result of damage by fire, explosion, power failure, or any act of nature.\n\n14.4  In no event shall Airspan be obliged to provide on-site maintenance. Subject to the provisions of this warranty clause, defective parts or components must be returned by Distributor to Airspan's designated facility located within the contiguous 48 states in the United States, freight prepaid, within the Initial Warranty Period, and said defective parts will be repaired or replaced by Airspan at no charge to Distributor.  In connection with such return by Distributor, Distributor shall comply with Airspan's Return Material Authorization (RMA) procedures.  Risk of loss or damage to Equipment or Software returned to Airspan for repair or replacement shall be borne by Distributor until delivery to Airspan.  Upon delivery of such Equipment or Software, Airspan shall assume the risk of loss or damage until that time that the Equipment or Software being repaired or replaced is returned and delivered to Distributor. Distributor will pay all transportation costs for Equipment or Software shipped to Airspan for repair or replacement.  Airspan shall pay all transportation costs associated\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 18\n\nwith returning repaired or replaced Equipment or Software to Distributor unless there was no fault found (NFF), in which event, the Distributor shall pay such transportation costs, along with Airspan's then prevailing standard NFF charge.\n\n14.5  Airspan will charge Distributor for any maintenance carried out which is not covered by the warranties contained in Section 14.2 or Section 15 at Airspan's then prevailing standard rates for such services.\n\n15.  WARRANTY ON REPAIRED AND REPLACEMENT MATERIALS.\n\nAirspan warrants that, following repair or replacement, the repaired or replaced Equipment or Software by Airspan shall be free from defects in materials and faulty workmanship and that the Software will conform in all material respects to Airspan's published specifications therefor for ninety (90) days from date of shipment from Airspan to Distributor or until the end of the Initial Warranty Period, whichever is longer.\n\n16.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n16.1  WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO SECTION 16.4, NEITHER Airspan, NOR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, SHAREHOLDERS, OR AFFILIATES (Airspan AND SUCH OTHER PERSONS, THE \"Airspan PARTIES\"), SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO DISTRIBUTOR FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, INCOME, REVENUE OR DATA, OR INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PURCHASE ORDER PLACED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER COLLATERAL CONTRACT, OR FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE EQUIPMENT OR THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE THEREOF OR THE INABILITY TO USE THEM EITHER SEPARATELY OR IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER EQUIPMENT OR SOFTWARE, OR FROM ANY OTHER CAUSE, WHETHER CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY, ON GROUNDS OF FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OR OTHERWISE.\n\n16.2  Without prejudice to Sections 16.3 and 16.4, the liability of the Airspan Parties, taken as a whole, for each event or series of connected events\n\n\n\n\n\narising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any purchase order placed pursuant to this Agreement, or any other collateral contract, or from or in connection with the Equipment or Software or the use thereof, or the inability to use them either separately or in combination with other equipment or software, or from any other cause, whether caused by negligence, breach of contract, strict liability, breach of warranty, on grounds of failure of essential purpose, or otherwise, shall in no circumstance exceed the total amount payable by Distributor to Airspan under this Agreement for the provision of\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 19\n\nthe Equipment or Software which gave rise to the loss or damage or in connection with which the loss or damage was incurred.\n\n16.3  Airspan Parties, taken as a whole, shall be liable for physical damage to Distributor's property resulting from Airspan's negligence under or in connection with this Agreement up to a maximum aggregate amount of one million US Dollars (US$1,000,000).  And Distributor, taken as a whole, shall be liable for physical damage to Airspan's property resulting from Distributor's negligence under or in connection with this Agreement up to a maximum aggregate amount of one million US Dollars (US$1,000,000).\n\n16.4  Nothing in this Agreement shall exclude or in any way limit Airspan liability for death or personal injury caused by its negligence.\n\n16.5  Save as provided for in Section 17 Distributor shall indemnify and hold harmless and defend the Airspan Parties from and against all claims, demands, actions, suits, proceedings, writs, judgments, orders and decrees brought, made or rendered against them or any of them and all damages, losses and expenses suffered or incurred by them or any of them howsoever arising out of or related to the breach by Distributor of any of the terms of this Agreement. Airspan shall notify Distributor forthwith of any claim, demand, action, suit, proceeding, writ, judgment, order or decree falling within the scope of this Section 16.5 and shall permit Distributor sole conduct of the same and shall provide reasonable assistance in relation thereto, subject to appropriate defense by Distributor and the payment by Distributor of Airspan's reasonable costs and expenses.\n\n16.6  Distributor shall include, in its agreements with its customers pursuant to which Distributor supplies Equipment or Software, provisions pursuant to which such customers agree that the Airspan Parties shall have no liability for any of the types of damages referred to at Section 16.1 in connection with or arising from the Equipment or Software or the use thereof, or the inability to use them either separately or in combination with other equipment or software, or from any other causes.\n\n17.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS INDEMNITY.\n\n17.1 Airspan agrees to indemnify and hold Distributor harmless with respect to any suit, claim, or proceeding brought against Distributor by a third party alleging that Distributor's use of the Equipment or the Software, separately or in combination, as a whole or in part, constitutes an infringement of any patent or copyright or misuse of proprietary or trade secret information.  Airspan agrees to defend Distributor against any such claims and to pay all litigation costs, reasonable attorney's fees, settlement payments, and any damages awarded or resulting from any such claim.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 20\n\n17.2 Distributor shall promptly advise Airspan of any such suit, claim, or proceeding and shall co-operate with Airspan in the defense or settlement thereof.  Airspan shall have sole control of the defense of any action involving such a claim and of all negotiations for its settlement or compromise.\n\n17.3 In the event that an injunction is obtained against Distributor's use of the Equipment and/or the Software, in whole or in part, as a result of any such claim, Airspan shall use its best efforts to either: (a) procure for Distributor the right to continue using the portions of the Equipment or the Software enjoined from use; or (b) replace or modify the same with functionally equivalent or better Equipment and/or Software so that Distributor's use is not subject to any such injunction.  In the event that Airspan cannot perform the remedies set forth in Sections 17.3(a) or 17.3(b), then Distributor shall have the right to return such Equipment and the Software to Airspan.  In the event of such return, Airspan shall refund the depreciated value of the Equipment and the license to use the Software within thirty (30) days of the receipt by Airspan of the Equipment and the Software.\n\n17.4 This indemnity shall not apply to claims arising in respect to the use of the Equipment or Software supplied by Airspan or manufactured by its suppliers in accordance with any design or any special instruction furnished by Distributor, or which is used by Distributor in a manner or for a purpose not contemplated by this Agreement.\n\n17.5 The provisions of this Section 17 set forth the entire obligation of Airspan with respect to any claim of patent infringement, copyright infringement, or misuse of proprietary or trade secret information.\n\n18.  EXPORT CONTROLS AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE.\n\n\n\n\n\n18.1 If any approval with respect to this Agreement, or the registration thereof, shall be required at any time during the term of this Agreement, with respect to giving legal effect to this Agreement in the Territory, or with respect to compliance with exchange regulations or other requirements so as to assure the right of remittance abroad of United States dollars pursuant to Section 6 hereof, Distributor shall immediately take whatever steps may be necessary in this respect, and any charges incurred in connection therewith shall be for the account of Distributor.  Distributor shall keep Airspan currently informed of its efforts in this connection.  Airspan shall be under no obligation to ship Airspan Products to Distributor hereunder until Distributor has provided Airspan with satisfactory evidence that such approval or registration is not required or that it has been obtained.\n\n18.2 In the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, Distributor shall at all times strictly comply with all export laws, regulations, and orders of the\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 21\n\nUnited Kingdom and the United States of America.

APPOINTMENT.      -----------\n\n1.1  Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Airspan hereby appoints Distributor as an independent, exclusive distributor to assist Airspan in marketing the Airspan Products to customers in the Territory, and Distributor hereby accepts such appointment as of the Effective Date of this Agreement. Distributor's appointment as a distributor of the Airspan Products grants to Distributor only a license to resell the\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 1\n\nAirspan Products to Distributor's customers in the Territory, and does not transfer any right, title, or interest in any of the Airspan Software to Distributor.\n\n1.2  Distributor's relationship to Airspan is that of an independent contractor, and nothing in this Agreement shall constitute Distributor as the agent or employee of Airspan.  Distributor shall have no authority to accept any order or make any offer (except as herein stated), or execute any instrument or make any commitment on behalf of Airspan.  Specifically, without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing, Distributor agrees not to make any representation, guarantee, or warranty on Airspan's behalf concerning the Airspan Products, but will refer customers to Airspan's printed literature. Nothing contained in this Agreement is to be construed as a limitation or restriction upon Airspan in the sale or other disposition of any of its products to any person, firm, or corporation inside or outside of the Territory. Airspan will pay no commissions under this Agreement.  Distributor's compensation is to be obtained solely by the difference between the price Distributor pays to Airspan and the price Distributor charges its customers. The parties also acknowledge that this Agreement is not intended to create a joint venture or partnership between Airspan and Distributor.\n\n1.3  Distributor will use its best efforts to maintain and support the Airspan Products within the Territory by devoting such attention, time, and effort as may be reasonably necessary to fully develop the available market potential.

Distributor will give Airspan thirty (30) days' prior, written notice of each new potential representation role being considered by Distributor, and Distributor will not undertake such representation without Airspan's prior, written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Except as\n\n\n\n\n\nprovided above, in no event will Airspan consent to Distributor's consultation for or representation of a manufacturer or supplier, which is directly or indirectly, a competitor of Airspan.\n\n1.4  Distributor shall maintain a place of business at the location specified in Section 21.10 where Distributor can be contacted by Airspan, customers, and prospective customers during regular business hours with a permanent mailing address and an accessible cellular telephone, and will provide Airspan with written notice promptly upon any change in address.

If      requested by Distributor, Airspan may arrange for shipment to be made to      Distributor's identified warehouse facilities or freight forwarder outside      of the city limits, subject to approval in writing by Airspan and agreement      to any additional charges in advance of shipment.  Unless specified in the      Purchase Order, Airspan will select the mode of shipment and the carrier.\n\nIn this Agreement, \"Incoterms\" means the most recent international rules      for the interpretation of trade terms published by the International      Chamber of Commerce as in force on the Effective Date.  Unless the context      otherwise requires, any term or expression which is defined in or given a      particular meaning by the provisions of the Incoterms shall have the same      meaning in this\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 9\n\nAgreement, but if there is any conflict between the provisions of the      Incoterms and this Agreement, the latter shall prevail.\n\n8.2 All risk of loss or damage to the Equipment and Software will pass to      Distributor on collection by the freight forwarder from Airspan. However,      Airspan will insure the Equipment against loss or damage in transit to the      agreed to location as set forth in the Purchase Order within the city      limits of the arrival airport as set forth in Paragraph 8.1.\n\n8.3 Title to the Equipment shall pass to Distributor on collection by the      freight forwarder from Airspan.\n\n8.4  If Distributor has any Airspan owned Equipment in its possession:\n\na.   Distributor shall ensure that Equipment is clearly marked as the      property of Airspan, and if asked, shall inform any third parties that the      Equipment is the property of Airspan;\n\nb.   Distributor shall not purport to create any security, mortgage, lien      or pledge over the Equipment, or otherwise deal with the Equipment without      Airspan's written consent;\n\n\n\n\n\nc.   In the event of any threatened seizure of the Equipment by any third      parties, and on termination or expiration of this Agreement, or any      Contract made pursuant to it, Airspan shall have the right, without      prejudice to any other remedy, to enter without prior notice any premises      and to repossess and take away or otherwise deal with the Equipment.\n\n8.5  The Software shall at all times remain the exclusive property of      Airspan, subject to the uses provided herein.\n\n8.6  Unless Distributor clearly advises Airspan to the contrary in      writing, Airspan may make partial deliveries on account of Purchase Orders.      Delay in delivery of any installment shall not relieve Distributor of its      obligation to accept said installment, provided that said delay does not      exceed sixty (60) days from Airspan's scheduled ship date and unless      Distributor has clearly advised Airspan to cancel the delayed installment      in writing at least fifteen (15) days prior to its revised planned shipment      date or its actual shipment date by Airspan.\n\n8.7  Airspan will use reasonable efforts to meet Distributor's requested      delivery schedules for Equipment and Software, but Airspan reserves the      right to refuse, or delay delivery to Distributor when Distributor's credit      is impaired,\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 10\n\nwhen Distributor is delinquent in payments or fails to meet other credit or      financial requirements reasonably established by Airspan, or when      Distributor has failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n8.8  Should orders for Equipment and Software exceed Airspan's available      inventory, Airspan will allocate its available inventory and make      deliveries on a basis that Airspan deems equitable, in its sole discretion,      and without liability to Distributor on account of the method of allocation      chosen or its implementation.  In any event, Airspan shall not be liable      for any direct, indirect, consequential, or special losses or damages      (including, but not limited to, loss of income or profit and loss of data)      that may be suffered by the Distributor or by any other person for failure      to deliver or for any delay or error in delivery of Equipment or Software      for any reason whatsoever.\n\n9.   TRADEMARKS AND COPYRIGHTS.\n\n9.1  Distributor acknowledges Airspan's exclusive right, title, and interest in and to any trademarks, trade names, logos and designations which Airspan may at any time have adopted, used, or registered in the United States of America and in the Territory (the \"Trademarks\"), and will not at any time do or cause to be done any act or thing contesting or in any way impairing or tending to impair any part of said right, title, and interest.  In connection with any reference to the Trademarks, Distributor shall not in any manner represent that it has an ownership interest in the Trademarks or registration(s) thereof, and Distributor acknowledges that no action by it or on its behalf shall create in Distributor's favor any right, title, or interest in or to the Trademarks.\n\n9.2  Distributor recognizes the validity of Airspan's copyright in any written material to which Airspan shall have made a claim to copyright protection, and Distributor specifically recognizes Airspan's exclusive right to copyright protection and/or registration of any translation of any advertising, promotional, or descriptive material furnished to Distributor by Airspan.\n\n9.3  Whenever Distributor refers to the Trademarks in advertising or in any other manner to identify the products, Distributor shall clearly indicate Airspan's ownership of the Trademarks and before distributing or publishing any advertising, descriptive, or promotional materials, Distributor shall affirmatively provide Airspan with an opportunity to inspect and approve such materials.\n\n9.4  Distributor agrees that when referring to the Trademarks, it shall diligently comply with all laws pertaining to the Trademarks at any time in force in the Territory.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 11\n\n9.5  Distributor shall promptly notify Airspan of any and all infringements, imitations, illegal uses, or misuses of the Trademarks which come to Distributor's attention.  Distributor also agrees that it shall not at any time take any action in the courts or before the administrative agencies of the Territory or otherwise to prevent the infringement, imitation, illegal use, or misuse of the Trademarks, it being clearly understood by Distributor that such action falls wholly within the authority of Airspan as sole owner of the Trademarks.\n\n9.6  Distributor agrees to render to Airspan all assistance in connection with any matter pertaining to the protection of the Trademarks, whether in the courts or before the administrative agencies of the Territory or otherwise, and to make promptly available to Airspan, its Distributors, and attorneys all of Distributor's files, records, and other information pertaining to the\n\n\n\n\n\nadvertising, promotion, and sale of the Airspan Products.  All assistance requested by Distributor in this paragraph shall be at AIRSPAN's expense.  This Expense includes costs, attorneys' and consultants' fees, and reimbursement of time spent by officers, agents and employees of Distributor.\n\n9.7  Distributor agrees and undertakes that it will not at any time, whether during the term of this Agreement or after its expiration or termination, adopt, use, or register without Airspan's prior, written consent any work or symbol or combination thereof which is similar to any of the Trademarks.\n\n9.8 In the advertising and sale of Airspan Products, Distributor may use the Trademarks in relation to those Airspan Products.  Distributor will not make or permit the alteration or removal of any tags, labels, or other identifying marks placed by Airspan on Airspan Products.  Distributor will not use or give any third party permission to use the Trademarks. Distributor will not use, or give any third party permission to use, the names \"Airspan Communications Ltd.\", \"Airspan Networks Incorporated\", \"ACL\", \"ANI\" or abbreviations or derivations thereof in Distributor's corporate titles, or in any way which might result in confusion as to Airspan and Distributor being separate and distinct entities. Distributor admits Airspan's exclusive ownership of the name \"Airspan Networks Incorporated\", \"Airspan Communications Ltd.\", \"ANI\", \"ACL\", and any abbreviations or derivations thereof and all of Airspan's Trademarks (whether registered or not).  Distributor shall not take any action inconsistent with Airspan's ownership of such Trademarks; therefore, Distributor shall treat all of Airspan's items distinctively (as to typography) and shall only use exact reproductions of all Airspan's symbols (including Airspan's logo).   Distributor shall not adopt or use any Trademark or product name which may be confusingly similar to any Airspan Trademark.  Distributor may use the Airspan logo as it appears on Airspan's letterhead.\n\n10.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND TRADE SECRETS.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 12\n\n10.1  In this Agreement, the term \"Confidential Information\" shall mean the information of Airspan disclosed to Distributor in connection with its performance under this Agreement, which is in written, recorded, photographic, machine-readable, or other physical form or oral information reduced to writing as soon as practicable after disclosure to Distributor, and which is conspicuously marked \"Confidential\", \"Proprietary\", \"Private\", or in any other manner indicating its confidential and/or proprietary nature.  Without limitation, Confidential Information includes:  (1) Airspan's software products, materials, data reports, programs, documentation, diagrams, and all related technical information; (2) all information relating to Airspan's business and products which is critical to Airspan's position in the marketplace, including future plans of Airspan relating to the fields of endeavor in which Distributor performs services for Airspan, the nature of certain work projects to which Distributor is exposed, and the identity of persons working on those projects; and (3) any improvements, enhancements, or modifications to the above made by or on behalf of Airspan during the performance under this Agreement which are provided, made available, or disclosed by or on behalf of Airspan to Distributor, or used by Airspan or any of Airspan's other Distributors in connection with their own sales activities.\n\n10.2  Trade secrets are confidential information that includes ideas, concepts, techniques, processes, inventions, knowledge, and know-how developed by Airspan which:  (1) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (2) is subject to the efforts of Airspan that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.  (This \"trade secret\" language comes from the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.)\n\n10.3  Distributor covenants and agrees that it will use the Confidential Information solely for the performance of services under this Agreement, and shall not disclose such Confidential Information to any other person (including Airspan employees in any other division, group, or entity), firm, or corporation.\n\n10.4  Distributor shall use the same degree of care in safeguarding the Confidential Information as it uses for its own confidential information of like importance, but no less than reasonable care.  Upon discovery of any disclosure or misuse of Confidential Information, Distributor shall endeavor to prevent any further disclosure or misuse.\n\n10.5  All Confidential Information shall remain the property of Airspan, and such Confidential Information and all copies thereof shall promptly be returned to Airspan upon request or, at Airspan 's option, destroyed, in which case Airspan shall be notified in writing when it has been destroyed.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 13\n\n10.6  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting to or conferring upon Distributor any rights, by license or otherwise, express or implied, in Airspan's Confidential Information, other than the right to use the Confidential Information for the purpose of this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n10.7  Any copies of the Confidential Information made by Distributor shall reproduce proprietary marking and legends included therein, but the provisions of this Agreement supersede any provisions of such legends inconsistent herewith.\n\n10.8  The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not be disclosed by Distributor to others, except with the prior, written consent of Airspan, or as may be required by law or as necessary to establish its rights hereunder.\n\n10.9  If, in connection with its performance, Distributor discloses to Airspan any ideas, developments, or inventions conceived or actually reduced to practice by Distributor prior to its performance hereunder, no relationship, confidential or otherwise, express or implied, is established with Airspan by the disclosure thereof.  With respect to any such disclosure, no obligation of any kind is assumed by nor may be implied against Airspan, its subsidiary, or associated companies unless a formal, separate, written contract regarding the subject of disclosure is consummated by the parties, and then the obligation shall be only as expressed in the separate contract.\n\n10.10  Distributor agrees that any breach of the provisions of this Section by Distributor or Distributor's personnel, agents, or subcontractors, or any third party providing products or services to Distributor will cause immediate and irreparable injury to Airspan and that, in the event of such breach, Airspan shall be entitled to injunctive relief and any and all other remedies available at law or in equity.\n\n10.11  After Distributor has received Airspan's Confidential Information and know-how, it will be impossible to segregate Airspan's knowledge and know- how from other knowledge acquired independently by Distributor.  Accordingly, during the performance of this Agreement and for three (3) months after termination of services under this Agreement, Distributor will not offer services to third parties which compete with the services provided by Airspan under this Agreement, or otherwise use the knowledge acquired from Airspan in order to compete with Airspan or its customers.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, Distributor is not precluded from any activities which concern product sectors or industries other than those that concern products or services similar to those offered by Airspan in connection with this Agreement.  Nothing in this paragraph will be construed to prevent Distributor from providing service to existing customers of Distributor which would result in their interruption of service to the public.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 14\n\n10.12 During the performance of this Agreement and for three (3) months after termination of services under this Agreement, Airspan will not offer products or services to third parties which compete with the products or services provided by Distributor under this Agreement, or otherwise use the knowledge acquired from Distributor in order to compete with Distributor its customers\n\n10.13 The obligations of this Section 10 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n11.  SOFTWARE LICENSE.\n\n11.1 Airspan grants Distributor, and Distributor hereby accepts, a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use, and to sublicense as set forth below, Software provided by Airspan hereunder only on a single System or unit of Equipment, as may be applicable.  No license is granted to use the Software on multiple Systems or in conjunction with Equipment furnished by a party other than Airspan, unless specifically agreed to in writing by Airspan.  Software licensed under this Agreement is defined as: (a) any digital instruction sequence or control data contained on any media, including but not limited to, any magnetic-, electronic-, optical-, or organic device, and the term Software shall include any enhancement, modification, extension, part, portion or expansion thereof or implementation or downloading from network of any of the foregoing, for use exclusively on a System or a unit of Equipment; and (b) all associated documentation used to describe, maintain and use the Software.\n\n11.2 Any Software provided to Distributor by Airspan will be treated as the exclusive property of Airspan, and Distributor will:  (a) treat such Software as Confidential Information under Section 10 of this Agreement; (b) utilize such Software or any portions or aspects thereof (including any methods or concepts utilized therein) solely on Systems or Equipment provided by Airspan; (c) forthwith return to Airspan all memory media, documentation and/or other material that has been modified, updated or replaced; (d) except to the extent permitted by applicable law not modify, disassemble or decompile such Software, or reverse engineer any portion of the Software or functioning of Systems or Equipment, or permit others to do so, without Airspan's prior written consent; (e) except to the extent permitted by applicable law not reproduce or copy such Software in whole or in part except for backup and archival purposes or as otherwise permitted in writing by Airspan; (f) not perform or release benchmarks or other comparisons of the Software; and (g) not remove any trademark, tradename, copyright, notice or other proprietary notice from the Software and Distributor shall be responsible for the conservation of the same on any back-up copy of the Software.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 15\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3 In the event of a breach of this license by Distributor, then Airspan may, in its discretion, terminate the license with immediate effect, whereupon Distributor shall return to Airspan all Software and copies thereof within ten (10) days.\n\n12        EXCUSABLE DELAY.\n\nAirspan shall not suffer any liability for non-performance, defective performance, or late performance under this Agreement due to causes beyond its control and without its fault or negligence such as, but not limited to, acts of God, war (including civil war), civil unrest, acts of government, fire, floods, explosions, the elements, epidemics, quarantine, restrictions, strikes, lock- outs, plant shutdown, material shortages, or delays in transportation or delays of its suppliers or subcontractors for like cause.\n\nIn the event of excusable delay as defined in the preceding sentence, then Airspan, upon giving prompt written notice to Distributor, shall be excused from such performance on a day-to-day basis to the extent of such prevention, restriction, or interference (and Distributor shall likewise be excused from performance of its obligations on a day-to-day basis to the extent Distributor's obligations relate to the performance so prevented, restricted, or interfered with), provided that Airspan shall use its best endeavors to avoid or remove such causes of non-performance and both parties shall proceed to perform with dispatch whenever such causes are removed or cease to exist.\n\n13.  TERM AND TERMINATION.\n\n13.1  This Agreement shall remain in effect for sixty (60) months from the Effective Date (the \"Initial Term\"). After the Initial Term, the term of the Agreement may be extended by a further period of five (5) years by mutual written agreement by the parties in the form of an amendment to this Agreement. If Distributor wishes to extend the term of the Agreement beyond the Initial Term, it  must notify Airspan in writing at least six (6) months prior to then end of the Initial Term. However, nothing contained herein shall be interpreted as requiring either party to renew or extend this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or of any other provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated prior to the expiration of its stated term as set forth below.\n\n13.2  Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time during the term of this Agreement if  either party fails materially to comply with any covenant, term, or provision of this Agreement, by written notice given to the other party not less than thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such termination. Either party's right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 13.2 may not be exercised unless said\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 16\n\nparty shall have given the other party written notice of the failure, and the other party has not cured the failure within the thirty (30) day period following notice from said party.\n\n13.3  This Agreement terminates automatically for just cause, with no further act or action of either party if:  (a) a receiver is appointed for Distributor or its property; (b) Distributor&sbsp;makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (c) any proceedings are commenced by, for, or against Distributor under any bankruptcy, insolvency, or debtor's relief law; or (d) Distributor is liquidated, dissolved, or otherwise terminates its activities.\n\n13.4 In the event of termination by either party for any reason, Distributor shall provide Airspan with lists of existing customers as well as other information necessary for an orderly changeover of representation in the Territory.\n\n13.5  Upon termination, Distributor shall immediately return to Airspan all Confidential Information, and Distributor agrees that neither it nor any company or organization controlled or directed by it shall divulge the contents of such material to any person at any time, notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.\n\n13.6 Airspan shall not be liable to Distributor for damages of any kind, including incidental or consequential damages, on account of the termination of this agreement in accordance with this section 13.  Airspan shall not be liable to Distributor on account of termination or expiration of this Agreement for reimbursement or damages for loss of goodwill, prospective profits, or anticipated orders, or on account of any expenditures, investments, leases, or commitments made by either party, or for any other reason whatsoever based upon or growing out of such termination or expiration.  Airspan will recognize payments due to Distributor for orders received up to ninety (90) days after the termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n\n13.7  Distributor acknowledges and agrees that: (a) Distributor has no expectation and has received no assurances that its business relationship with Airspan will continue beyond the states term of this agreement or its earlier termination in accordance with this section, that any investment by Distributor in the promotion of Airspan's Products will be recovered or recouped, or that Distributor shall obtain any anticipated amount of profits by virtue of this Agreement; and (b) Distributor shall not have or acquire by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise any vested, proprietary, or other right in the promotion of Airspan's Products or in any goodwill created by its efforts hereunder.\n\n\n\n\n\n13.8  This Section 13.8, as well as the provisions of Sections 9, 10, 11, 16, 17 and 18, shall survive the termination of this Agreement.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 17\n\n14.  WARRANTY.\n\n14.1 THE WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN SECTIONS 14 AND 15 OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE IN LIEU OF, AND Airspan HEREBY DISCLAIMS, ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED TERMS AND WARRANTIES OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\n14.2 Subject to Sections 14.3 and 14.4, Airspan warrants that the Equipment sold to Distributor under this Agreement shall, under normal use and service, be free from defects in materials and faulty workmanship, and that the Software licensed to Distributor under this Agreement shall conform in all material respects to Airspan's published specifications therefor. The warranty period for any item of Equipment and related Software shall be twelve (12) months from the date of delivery of such Equipment and related Software to Distributor as set forth in Paragraph 8.1 (hereinafter, this period of time shall be referred to as the \"Initial Warranty Period.\")\n\n14.3 Airspan's obligation and Distributor's sole remedy under this warranty are limited to the replacement or repair, at Airspan's option, of the defective Equipment or Software within the Initial Warranty Period. Airspan shall have no obligation to remedy any such defect if it can be shown that: (a) the Equipment or Software was altered, repaired, or reworked by any party other than Airspan without Airspan's prior written consent; (b) such defects were the result of Distributor's or a third party's improper storage, mishandling, abuse, or misuse of the Equipment or Software; (c) such defects were the result of Distributor's or a third party's use of the Equipment or Software in conjunction with equipment electronically or mechanically incompatible or of an inferior quality; or (d) the defect was the result of damage by fire, explosion, power failure, or any act of nature.\n\n14.4  In no event shall Airspan be obliged to provide on-site maintenance.

Airspan agrees to defend Distributor against any such claims and to pay all litigation costs, reasonable attorney's fees, settlement payments, and any damages awarded or resulting from any such claim.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 20\n\n17.2 Distributor shall promptly advise Airspan of any such suit, claim, or proceeding and shall co-operate with Airspan in the defense or settlement thereof.  Airspan shall have sole control of the defense of any action involving such a claim and of all negotiations for its settlement or compromise.\n\n17.3 In the event that an injunction is obtained against Distributor's use of the Equipment and/or the Software, in whole or in part, as a result of any such claim, Airspan shall use its best efforts to either: (a) procure for Distributor the right to continue using the portions of the Equipment or the Software enjoined from use; or (b) replace or modify the same with functionally equivalent or better Equipment and/or Software so that Distributor's use is not subject to any such injunction.  In the event that Airspan cannot perform the remedies set forth in Sections 17.3(a) or 17.3(b), then Distributor shall have the right to return such Equipment and the Software to Airspan.  In the event of such return, Airspan shall refund the depreciated value of the Equipment and the license to use the Software within thirty (30) days of the receipt by Airspan of the Equipment and the Software.\n\n17.4 This indemnity shall not apply to claims arising in respect to the use of the Equipment or Software supplied by Airspan or manufactured by its suppliers in accordance with any design or any special instruction furnished by Distributor, or which is used by Distributor in a manner or for a purpose not contemplated by this Agreement.\n\n17.5 The provisions of this Section 17 set forth the entire obligation of Airspan with respect to any claim of patent infringement, copyright infringement, or misuse of proprietary or trade secret information.\n\n18.

Distributor shall keep Airspan currently informed of its efforts in this connection.  Airspan shall be under no obligation to ship Airspan Products to Distributor hereunder until Distributor has provided Airspan with satisfactory evidence that such approval or registration is not required or that it has been obtained.\n\n18.2 In the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, Distributor shall at all times strictly comply with all export laws, regulations, and orders of the\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 21\n\nUnited Kingdom and the United States of America.

APPOINTMENT.      -----------\n\n1.1  Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Airspan hereby appoints Distributor as an independent, exclusive distributor to assist Airspan in marketing the Airspan Products to customers in the Territory, and Distributor hereby accepts such appointment as of the Effective Date of this Agreement. Distributor's appointment as a distributor of the Airspan Products grants to Distributor only a license to resell the\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 1\n\nAirspan Products to Distributor's customers in the Territory, and does not transfer any right, title, or interest in any of the Airspan Software to Distributor.\n\n1.2  Distributor's relationship to Airspan is that of an independent contractor, and nothing in this Agreement shall constitute Distributor as the agent or employee of Airspan.  Distributor shall have no authority to accept any order or make any offer (except as herein stated), or execute any instrument or make any commitment on behalf of Airspan.  Specifically, without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing, Distributor agrees not to make any representation, guarantee, or warranty on Airspan's behalf concerning the Airspan Products, but will refer customers to Airspan's printed literature. Nothing contained in this Agreement is to be construed as a limitation or restriction upon Airspan in the sale or other disposition of any of its products to any person, firm, or corporation inside or outside of the Territory. Airspan will pay no commissions under this Agreement.  Distributor's compensation is to be obtained solely by the difference between the price Distributor pays to Airspan and the price Distributor charges its customers. The parties also acknowledge that this Agreement is not intended to create a joint venture or partnership between Airspan and Distributor.\n\n1.3  Distributor will use its best efforts to maintain and support the Airspan Products within the Territory by devoting such attention, time, and effort as may be reasonably necessary to fully develop the available market potential.

Distributor will give Airspan thirty (30) days' prior, written notice of each new potential representation role being considered by Distributor, and Distributor will not undertake such representation without Airspan's prior, written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Except as\n\n\n\n\n\nprovided above, in no event will Airspan consent to Distributor's consultation for or representation of a manufacturer or supplier, which is directly or indirectly, a competitor of Airspan.\n\n1.4  Distributor shall maintain a place of business at the location specified in Section 21.10 where Distributor can be contacted by Airspan, customers, and prospective customers during regular business hours with a permanent mailing address and an accessible cellular telephone, and will provide Airspan with written notice promptly upon any change in address.

Airspan will be responsible for and pay all packing, shipping, freight, and      insurance charges to the agreed upon location within the city limits. If      requested by Distributor, Airspan may arrange for shipment to be made to      Distributor's identified warehouse facilities or freight forwarder outside      of the city limits, subject to approval in writing by Airspan and agreement      to any additional charges in advance of shipment.  Unless specified in the      Purchase Order, Airspan will select the mode of shipment and the carrier.\n\nIn this Agreement, \"Incoterms\" means the most recent international rules      for the interpretation of trade terms published by the International      Chamber of Commerce as in force on the Effective Date.  Unless the context      otherwise requires, any term or expression which is defined in or given a      particular meaning by the provisions of the Incoterms shall have the same      meaning in this\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 9\n\nAgreement, but if there is any conflict between the provisions of the      Incoterms and this Agreement, the latter shall prevail.\n\n8.2 All risk of loss or damage to the Equipment and Software will pass to      Distributor on collection by the freight forwarder from Airspan. However,      Airspan will insure the Equipment against loss or damage in transit to the      agreed to location as set forth in the Purchase Order within the city      limits of the arrival airport as set forth in Paragraph 8.1.\n\n8.3 Title to the Equipment shall pass to Distributor on collection by the      freight forwarder from Airspan.\n\n8.4  If Distributor has any Airspan owned Equipment in its possession:\n\na.   Distributor shall ensure that Equipment is clearly marked as the      property of Airspan, and if asked, shall inform any third parties that the      Equipment is the property of Airspan;\n\nb.   Distributor shall not purport to create any security, mortgage, lien      or pledge over the Equipment, or otherwise deal with the Equipment without      Airspan's written consent;\n\n\n\n\n\nc.   In the event of any threatened seizure of the Equipment by any third      parties, and on termination or expiration of this Agreement, or any      Contract made pursuant to it, Airspan shall have the right, without      prejudice to any other remedy, to enter without prior notice any premises      and to repossess and take away or otherwise deal with the Equipment.\n\n8.5  The Software shall at all times remain the exclusive property of      Airspan, subject to the uses provided herein.\n\n8.6  Unless Distributor clearly advises Airspan to the contrary in      writing, Airspan may make partial deliveries on account of Purchase Orders.      Delay in delivery of any installment shall not relieve Distributor of its      obligation to accept said installment, provided that said delay does not      exceed sixty (60) days from Airspan's scheduled ship date and unless      Distributor has clearly advised Airspan to cancel the delayed installment      in writing at least fifteen (15) days prior to its revised planned shipment      date or its actual shipment date by Airspan.\n\n8.7  Airspan will use reasonable efforts to meet Distributor's requested      delivery schedules for Equipment and Software, but Airspan reserves the      right to refuse, or delay delivery to Distributor when Distributor's credit      is impaired,\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 10\n\nwhen Distributor is delinquent in payments or fails to meet other credit or      financial requirements reasonably established by Airspan, or when      Distributor has failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n8.8  Should orders for Equipment and Software exceed Airspan's available      inventory, Airspan will allocate its available inventory and make      deliveries on a basis that Airspan deems equitable, in its sole discretion,      and without liability to Distributor on account of the method of allocation      chosen or its implementation.  In any event, Airspan shall not be liable      for any direct, indirect, consequential, or special losses or damages      (including, but not limited to, loss of income or profit and loss of data)      that may be suffered by the Distributor or by any other person for failure      to deliver or for any delay or error in delivery of Equipment or Software      for any reason whatsoever.\n\n9.   TRADEMARKS AND COPYRIGHTS.\n\n9.1  Distributor acknowledges Airspan's exclusive right, title, and interest in and to any trademarks, trade names, logos and designations which Airspan may at any time have adopted, used, or registered in the United States of America and in the Territory (the \"Trademarks\"), and will not at any time do or cause to be done any act or thing contesting or in any way impairing or tending to impair any part of said right, title, and interest.  In connection with any reference to the Trademarks, Distributor shall not in any manner represent that it has an ownership interest in the Trademarks or registration(s) thereof, and Distributor acknowledges that no action by it or on its behalf shall create in Distributor's favor any right, title, or interest in or to the Trademarks.\n\n9.2  Distributor recognizes the validity of Airspan's copyright in any written material to which Airspan shall have made a claim to copyright protection, and Distributor specifically recognizes Airspan's exclusive right to copyright protection and/or registration of any translation of any advertising, promotional, or descriptive material furnished to Distributor by Airspan.\n\n9.3  Whenever Distributor refers to the Trademarks in advertising or in any other manner to identify the products, Distributor shall clearly indicate Airspan's ownership of the Trademarks and before distributing or publishing any advertising, descriptive, or promotional materials, Distributor shall affirmatively provide Airspan with an opportunity to inspect and approve such materials.\n\n9.4  Distributor agrees that when referring to the Trademarks, it shall diligently comply with all laws pertaining to the Trademarks at any time in force in the Territory.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 11\n\n9.5  Distributor shall promptly notify Airspan of any and all infringements, imitations, illegal uses, or misuses of the Trademarks which come to Distributor's attention.  Distributor also agrees that it shall not at any time take any action in the courts or before the administrative agencies of the Territory or otherwise to prevent the infringement, imitation, illegal use, or misuse of the Trademarks, it being clearly understood by Distributor that such action falls wholly within the authority of Airspan as sole owner of the Trademarks.\n\n9.6  Distributor agrees to render to Airspan all assistance in connection with any matter pertaining to the protection of the Trademarks, whether in the courts or before the administrative agencies of the Territory or otherwise, and to make promptly available to Airspan, its Distributors, and attorneys all of Distributor's files, records, and other information pertaining to the\n\n\n\n\n\nadvertising, promotion, and sale of the Airspan Products.  All assistance requested by Distributor in this paragraph shall be at AIRSPAN's expense.  This Expense includes costs, attorneys' and consultants' fees, and reimbursement of time spent by officers, agents and employees of Distributor.\n\n9.7  Distributor agrees and undertakes that it will not at any time, whether during the term of this Agreement or after its expiration or termination, adopt, use, or register without Airspan's prior, written consent any work or symbol or combination thereof which is similar to any of the Trademarks.\n\n9.8 In the advertising and sale of Airspan Products, Distributor may use the Trademarks in relation to those Airspan Products.  Distributor will not make or permit the alteration or removal of any tags, labels, or other identifying marks placed by Airspan on Airspan Products.  Distributor will not use or give any third party permission to use the Trademarks. Distributor will not use, or give any third party permission to use, the names \"Airspan Communications Ltd.\", \"Airspan Networks Incorporated\", \"ACL\", \"ANI\" or abbreviations or derivations thereof in Distributor's corporate titles, or in any way which might result in confusion as to Airspan and Distributor being separate and distinct entities. Distributor admits Airspan's exclusive ownership of the name \"Airspan Networks Incorporated\", \"Airspan Communications Ltd.\", \"ANI\", \"ACL\", and any abbreviations or derivations thereof and all of Airspan's Trademarks (whether registered or not).  Distributor shall not take any action inconsistent with Airspan's ownership of such Trademarks; therefore, Distributor shall treat all of Airspan's items distinctively (as to typography) and shall only use exact reproductions of all Airspan's symbols (including Airspan's logo).   Distributor shall not adopt or use any Trademark or product name which may be confusingly similar to any Airspan Trademark.  Distributor may use the Airspan logo as it appears on Airspan's letterhead.\n\n10.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND TRADE SECRETS.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 12\n\n10.1  In this Agreement, the term \"Confidential Information\" shall mean the information of Airspan disclosed to Distributor in connection with its performance under this Agreement, which is in written, recorded, photographic, machine-readable, or other physical form or oral information reduced to writing as soon as practicable after disclosure to Distributor, and which is conspicuously marked \"Confidential\", \"Proprietary\", \"Private\", or in any other manner indicating its confidential and/or proprietary nature.  Without limitation, Confidential Information includes:  (1) Airspan's software products, materials, data reports, programs, documentation, diagrams, and all related technical information; (2) all information relating to Airspan's business and products which is critical to Airspan's position in the marketplace, including future plans of Airspan relating to the fields of endeavor in which Distributor performs services for Airspan, the nature of certain work projects to which Distributor is exposed, and the identity of persons working on those projects; and (3) any improvements, enhancements, or modifications to the above made by or on behalf of Airspan during the performance under this Agreement which are provided, made available, or disclosed by or on behalf of Airspan to Distributor, or used by Airspan or any of Airspan's other Distributors in connection with their own sales activities.\n\n10.2  Trade secrets are confidential information that includes ideas, concepts, techniques, processes, inventions, knowledge, and know-how developed by Airspan which:  (1) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (2) is subject to the efforts of Airspan that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.  (This \"trade secret\" language comes from the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.)\n\n10.3  Distributor covenants and agrees that it will use the Confidential Information solely for the performance of services under this Agreement, and shall not disclose such Confidential Information to any other person (including Airspan employees in any other division, group, or entity), firm, or corporation.\n\n10.4  Distributor shall use the same degree of care in safeguarding the Confidential Information as it uses for its own confidential information of like importance, but no less than reasonable care.  Upon discovery of any disclosure or misuse of Confidential Information, Distributor shall endeavor to prevent any further disclosure or misuse.\n\n10.5  All Confidential Information shall remain the property of Airspan, and such Confidential Information and all copies thereof shall promptly be returned to Airspan upon request or, at Airspan 's option, destroyed, in which case Airspan shall be notified in writing when it has been destroyed.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 13\n\n10.6  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting to or conferring upon Distributor any rights, by license or otherwise, express or implied, in Airspan's Confidential Information, other than the right to use the Confidential Information for the purpose of this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n10.7  Any copies of the Confidential Information made by Distributor shall reproduce proprietary marking and legends included therein, but the provisions of this Agreement supersede any provisions of such legends inconsistent herewith.\n\n10.8  The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not be disclosed by Distributor to others, except with the prior, written consent of Airspan, or as may be required by law or as necessary to establish its rights hereunder.\n\n10.9  If, in connection with its performance, Distributor discloses to Airspan any ideas, developments, or inventions conceived or actually reduced to practice by Distributor prior to its performance hereunder, no relationship, confidential or otherwise, express or implied, is established with Airspan by the disclosure thereof.  With respect to any such disclosure, no obligation of any kind is assumed by nor may be implied against Airspan, its subsidiary, or associated companies unless a formal, separate, written contract regarding the subject of disclosure is consummated by the parties, and then the obligation shall be only as expressed in the separate contract.\n\n10.10  Distributor agrees that any breach of the provisions of this Section by Distributor or Distributor's personnel, agents, or subcontractors, or any third party providing products or services to Distributor will cause immediate and irreparable injury to Airspan and that, in the event of such breach, Airspan shall be entitled to injunctive relief and any and all other remedies available at law or in equity.\n\n10.11  After Distributor has received Airspan's Confidential Information and know-how, it will be impossible to segregate Airspan's knowledge and know- how from other knowledge acquired independently by Distributor.  Accordingly, during the performance of this Agreement and for three (3) months after termination of services under this Agreement, Distributor will not offer services to third parties which compete with the services provided by Airspan under this Agreement, or otherwise use the knowledge acquired from Airspan in order to compete with Airspan or its customers.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, Distributor is not precluded from any activities which concern product sectors or industries other than those that concern products or services similar to those offered by Airspan in connection with this Agreement.  Nothing in this paragraph will be construed to prevent Distributor from providing service to existing customers of Distributor which would result in their interruption of service to the public.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 14\n\n10.12 During the performance of this Agreement and for three (3) months after termination of services under this Agreement, Airspan will not offer products or services to third parties which compete with the products or services provided by Distributor under this Agreement, or otherwise use the knowledge acquired from Distributor in order to compete with Distributor its customers\n\n10.13 The obligations of this Section 10 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n11.  SOFTWARE LICENSE.\n\n11.1 Airspan grants Distributor, and Distributor hereby accepts, a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use, and to sublicense as set forth below, Software provided by Airspan hereunder only on a single System or unit of Equipment, as may be applicable.  No license is granted to use the Software on multiple Systems or in conjunction with Equipment furnished by a party other than Airspan, unless specifically agreed to in writing by Airspan.  Software licensed under this Agreement is defined as: (a) any digital instruction sequence or control data contained on any media, including but not limited to, any magnetic-, electronic-, optical-, or organic device, and the term Software shall include any enhancement, modification, extension, part, portion or expansion thereof or implementation or downloading from network of any of the foregoing, for use exclusively on a System or a unit of Equipment; and (b) all associated documentation used to describe, maintain and use the Software.\n\n11.2 Any Software provided to Distributor by Airspan will be treated as the exclusive property of Airspan, and Distributor will:  (a) treat such Software as Confidential Information under Section 10 of this Agreement; (b) utilize such Software or any portions or aspects thereof (including any methods or concepts utilized therein) solely on Systems or Equipment provided by Airspan; (c) forthwith return to Airspan all memory media, documentation and/or other material that has been modified, updated or replaced; (d) except to the extent permitted by applicable law not modify, disassemble or decompile such Software, or reverse engineer any portion of the Software or functioning of Systems or Equipment, or permit others to do so, without Airspan's prior written consent; (e) except to the extent permitted by applicable law not reproduce or copy such Software in whole or in part except for backup and archival purposes or as otherwise permitted in writing by Airspan; (f) not perform or release benchmarks or other comparisons of the Software; and (g) not remove any trademark, tradename, copyright, notice or other proprietary notice from the Software and Distributor shall be responsible for the conservation of the same on any back-up copy of the Software.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 15\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3 In the event of a breach of this license by Distributor, then Airspan may, in its discretion, terminate the license with immediate effect, whereupon Distributor shall return to Airspan all Software and copies thereof within ten (10) days.\n\n12        EXCUSABLE DELAY.\n\nAirspan shall not suffer any liability for non-performance, defective performance, or late performance under this Agreement due to causes beyond its control and without its fault or negligence such as, but not limited to, acts of God, war (including civil war), civil unrest, acts of government, fire, floods, explosions, the elements, epidemics, quarantine, restrictions, strikes, lock- outs, plant shutdown, material shortages, or delays in transportation or delays of its suppliers or subcontractors for like cause.\n\nIn the event of excusable delay as defined in the preceding sentence, then Airspan, upon giving prompt written notice to Distributor, shall be excused from such performance on a day-to-day basis to the extent of such prevention, restriction, or interference (and Distributor shall likewise be excused from performance of its obligations on a day-to-day basis to the extent Distributor's obligations relate to the performance so prevented, restricted, or interfered with), provided that Airspan shall use its best endeavors to avoid or remove such causes of non-performance and both parties shall proceed to perform with dispatch whenever such causes are removed or cease to exist.\n\n13.  TERM AND TERMINATION.\n\n13.1  This Agreement shall remain in effect for sixty (60) months from the Effective Date (the \"Initial Term\"). After the Initial Term, the term of the Agreement may be extended by a further period of five (5) years by mutual written agreement by the parties in the form of an amendment to this Agreement. If Distributor wishes to extend the term of the Agreement beyond the Initial Term, it  must notify Airspan in writing at least six (6) months prior to then end of the Initial Term. However, nothing contained herein shall be interpreted as requiring either party to renew or extend this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or of any other provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated prior to the expiration of its stated term as set forth below.\n\n13.2  Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time during the term of this Agreement if  either party fails materially to comply with any covenant, term, or provision of this Agreement, by written notice given to the other party not less than thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such termination. Either party's right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 13.2 may not be exercised unless said\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 16\n\nparty shall have given the other party written notice of the failure, and the other party has not cured the failure within the thirty (30) day period following notice from said party.\n\n13.3  This Agreement terminates automatically for just cause, with no further act or action of either party if:  (a) a receiver is appointed for Distributor or its property; (b) Distributor&sbsp;makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (c) any proceedings are commenced by, for, or against Distributor under any bankruptcy, insolvency, or debtor's relief law; or (d) Distributor is liquidated, dissolved, or otherwise terminates its activities.\n\n13.4 In the event of termination by either party for any reason, Distributor shall provide Airspan with lists of existing customers as well as other information necessary for an orderly changeover of representation in the Territory.\n\n13.5  Upon termination, Distributor shall immediately return to Airspan all Confidential Information, and Distributor agrees that neither it nor any company or organization controlled or directed by it shall divulge the contents of such material to any person at any time, notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.\n\n13.6 Airspan shall not be liable to Distributor for damages of any kind, including incidental or consequential damages, on account of the termination of this agreement in accordance with this section 13.  Airspan shall not be liable to Distributor on account of termination or expiration of this Agreement for reimbursement or damages for loss of goodwill, prospective profits, or anticipated orders, or on account of any expenditures, investments, leases, or commitments made by either party, or for any other reason whatsoever based upon or growing out of such termination or expiration.  Airspan will recognize payments due to Distributor for orders received up to ninety (90) days after the termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n\n13.7  Distributor acknowledges and agrees that: (a) Distributor has no expectation and has received no assurances that its business relationship with Airspan will continue beyond the states term of this agreement or its earlier termination in accordance with this section, that any investment by Distributor in the promotion of Airspan's Products will be recovered or recouped, or that Distributor shall obtain any anticipated amount of profits by virtue of this Agreement; and (b) Distributor shall not have or acquire by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise any vested, proprietary, or other right in the promotion of Airspan's Products or in any goodwill created by its efforts hereunder.\n\n\n\n\n\n13.8  This Section 13.8, as well as the provisions of Sections 9, 10, 11, 16, 17 and 18, shall survive the termination of this Agreement.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 17\n\n14.  WARRANTY.\n\n14.1 THE WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN SECTIONS 14 AND 15 OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE IN LIEU OF, AND Airspan HEREBY DISCLAIMS, ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED TERMS AND WARRANTIES OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\n14.2 Subject to Sections 14.3 and 14.4, Airspan warrants that the Equipment sold to Distributor under this Agreement shall, under normal use and service, be free from defects in materials and faulty workmanship, and that the Software licensed to Distributor under this Agreement shall conform in all material respects to Airspan's published specifications therefor. The warranty period for any item of Equipment and related Software shall be twelve (12) months from the date of delivery of such Equipment and related Software to Distributor as set forth in Paragraph 8.1 (hereinafter, this period of time shall be referred to as the \"Initial Warranty Period.\")\n\n14.3 Airspan's obligation and Distributor's sole remedy under this warranty are limited to the replacement or repair, at Airspan's option, of the defective Equipment or Software within the Initial Warranty Period. Airspan shall have no obligation to remedy any such defect if it can be shown that: (a) the Equipment or Software was altered, repaired, or reworked by any party other than Airspan without Airspan's prior written consent; (b) such defects were the result of Distributor's or a third party's improper storage, mishandling, abuse, or misuse of the Equipment or Software; (c) such defects were the result of Distributor's or a third party's use of the Equipment or Software in conjunction with equipment electronically or mechanically incompatible or of an inferior quality; or (d) the defect was the result of damage by fire, explosion, power failure, or any act of nature.\n\n14.4  In no event shall Airspan be obliged to provide on-site maintenance. Subject to the provisions of this warranty clause, defective parts or components must be returned by Distributor to Airspan's designated facility located within the contiguous 48 states in the United States, freight prepaid, within the Initial Warranty Period, and said defective parts will be repaired or replaced by Airspan at no charge to Distributor.  In connection with such return by Distributor, Distributor shall comply with Airspan's Return Material Authorization (RMA) procedures.  Risk of loss or damage to Equipment or Software returned to Airspan for repair or replacement shall be borne by Distributor until delivery to Airspan.

Distributor will pay all transportation costs for Equipment or Software shipped to Airspan for repair or replacement.  Airspan shall pay all transportation costs associated\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 18\n\nwith returning repaired or replaced Equipment or Software to Distributor unless there was no fault found (NFF), in which event, the Distributor shall pay such transportation costs, along with Airspan's then prevailing standard NFF charge.\n\n14.5  Airspan will charge Distributor for any maintenance carried out which is not covered by the warranties contained in Section 14.2 or Section 15 at Airspan's then prevailing standard rates for such services.\n\n15.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n16.1  WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO SECTION 16.4, NEITHER Airspan, NOR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, SHAREHOLDERS, OR AFFILIATES (Airspan AND SUCH OTHER PERSONS, THE \"Airspan PARTIES\"), SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO DISTRIBUTOR FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, INCOME, REVENUE OR DATA, OR INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PURCHASE ORDER PLACED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER COLLATERAL CONTRACT, OR FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE EQUIPMENT OR THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE THEREOF OR THE INABILITY TO USE THEM EITHER SEPARATELY OR IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER EQUIPMENT OR SOFTWARE, OR FROM ANY OTHER CAUSE, WHETHER CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY, ON GROUNDS OF FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OR OTHERWISE.\n\n16.2  Without prejudice to Sections 16.3 and 16.4, the liability of the Airspan Parties, taken as a whole, for each event or series of connected events\n\n\n\n\n\narising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any purchase order placed pursuant to this Agreement, or any other collateral contract, or from or in connection with the Equipment or Software or the use thereof, or the inability to use them either separately or in combination with other equipment or software, or from any other cause, whether caused by negligence, breach of contract, strict liability, breach of warranty, on grounds of failure of essential purpose, or otherwise, shall in no circumstance exceed the total amount payable by Distributor to Airspan under this Agreement for the provision of\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 19\n\nthe Equipment or Software which gave rise to the loss or damage or in connection with which the loss or damage was incurred.\n\n16.3  Airspan Parties, taken as a whole, shall be liable for physical damage to Distributor's property resulting from Airspan's negligence under or in connection with this Agreement up to a maximum aggregate amount of one million US Dollars (US$1,000,000).  And Distributor, taken as a whole, shall be liable for physical damage to Airspan's property resulting from Distributor's negligence under or in connection with this Agreement up to a maximum aggregate amount of one million US Dollars (US$1,000,000).\n\n16.4  Nothing in this Agreement shall exclude or in any way limit Airspan liability for death or personal injury caused by its negligence.\n\n16.5  Save as provided for in Section 17 Distributor shall indemnify and hold harmless and defend the Airspan Parties from and against all claims, demands, actions, suits, proceedings, writs, judgments, orders and decrees brought, made or rendered against them or any of them and all damages, losses and expenses suffered or incurred by them or any of them howsoever arising out of or related to the breach by Distributor of any of the terms of this Agreement. Airspan shall notify Distributor forthwith of any claim, demand, action, suit, proceeding, writ, judgment, order or decree falling within the scope of this Section 16.5 and shall permit Distributor sole conduct of the same and shall provide reasonable assistance in relation thereto, subject to appropriate defense by Distributor and the payment by Distributor of Airspan's reasonable costs and expenses.\n\n16.6  Distributor shall include, in its agreements with its customers pursuant to which Distributor supplies Equipment or Software, provisions pursuant to which such customers agree that the Airspan Parties shall have no liability for any of the types of damages referred to at Section 16.1 in connection with or arising from the Equipment or Software or the use thereof, or the inability to use them either separately or in combination with other equipment or software, or from any other causes.\n\n17.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS INDEMNITY.\n\n17.1 Airspan agrees to indemnify and hold Distributor harmless with respect to any suit, claim, or proceeding brought against Distributor by a third party alleging that Distributor's use of the Equipment or the Software, separately or in combination, as a whole or in part, constitutes an infringement of any patent or copyright or misuse of proprietary or trade secret information.  Airspan agrees to defend Distributor against any such claims and to pay all litigation costs, reasonable attorney's fees, settlement payments, and any damages awarded or resulting from any such claim.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 20\n\n17.2 Distributor shall promptly advise Airspan of any such suit, claim, or proceeding and shall co-operate with Airspan in the defense or settlement thereof.  Airspan shall have sole control of the defense of any action involving such a claim and of all negotiations for its settlement or compromise.\n\n17.3 In the event that an injunction is obtained against Distributor's use of the Equipment and/or the Software, in whole or in part, as a result of any such claim, Airspan shall use its best efforts to either: (a) procure for Distributor the right to continue using the portions of the Equipment or the Software enjoined from use; or (b) replace or modify the same with functionally equivalent or better Equipment and/or Software so that Distributor's use is not subject to any such injunction.  In the event that Airspan cannot perform the remedies set forth in Sections 17.3(a) or 17.3(b), then Distributor shall have the right to return such Equipment and the Software to Airspan.  In the event of such return, Airspan shall refund the depreciated value of the Equipment and the license to use the Software within thirty (30) days of the receipt by Airspan of the Equipment and the Software.\n\n17.4 This indemnity shall not apply to claims arising in respect to the use of the Equipment or Software supplied by Airspan or manufactured by its suppliers in accordance with any design or any special instruction furnished by Distributor, or which is used by Distributor in a manner or for a purpose not contemplated by this Agreement.\n\n17.5 The provisions of this Section 17 set forth the entire obligation of Airspan with respect to any claim of patent infringement, copyright infringement, or misuse of proprietary or trade secret information.\n\n18.  EXPORT CONTROLS AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE.\n\n\n\n\n\n18.1 If any approval with respect to this Agreement, or the registration thereof, shall be required at any time during the term of this Agreement, with respect to giving legal effect to this Agreement in the Territory, or with respect to compliance with exchange regulations or other requirements so as to assure the right of remittance abroad of United States dollars pursuant to Section 6 hereof, Distributor shall immediately take whatever steps may be necessary in this respect, and any charges incurred in connection therewith shall be for the account of Distributor.  Distributor shall keep Airspan currently informed of its efforts in this connection.  Airspan shall be under no obligation to ship Airspan Products to Distributor hereunder until Distributor has provided Airspan with satisfactory evidence that such approval or registration is not required or that it has been obtained.\n\n18.2 In the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, Distributor shall at all times strictly comply with all export laws, regulations, and orders of the\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 21\n\nUnited Kingdom and the United States of America.

The Parties agree to use commercially reasonable good faith efforts to negotiate with any applicable governmental authority in order to avoid any such limitations.\n\n3. PARTIES' CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE JOINT VENTURE AND FINANCING.\n\n3.1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, T&L shall contribute, or cause to be contributed, to the Operating Company cash in the amount of $21,614,000. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, T&L further agrees to pay to Operating Company as a contribution to capital upon Formation (as defined below) $3,000,000.\n\n3.2. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Igene shall transfer and assign, or cause to be transferred and assigned,\n\n\n\n\n\nto the Operating Company the Transferred Assets described in Appendix 3.2.\n\n3.3.

In the event that the Transferred Assets are not transferred to the Operating Company at such time or on such other date as is specified herein or in the Asset Transfer Agreement, the entity who is to make such transfer(s) shall, without any further cost to the Joint Venture or to the other Party, (a) ensure that the Joint Venture shall have all of the benefits and bear all of the burdens of such assets on and from Formation and (b) fully and legally assign to the Operating Company such assets as soon after Formation as practicable.\n\n3.4. Title to the Transferred Assets shall be passed to the Operating Company in accordance with Asset Transfer Agreement to be entered into by the Operating Company and Igene upon Formation. Such Asset Transfer Agreement shall be in the form set forth in Appendix 3.4. Such Transferred Assets shall be contributed free and clear of any and all indebtedness, liens and encumbrances.\n\n3.5. As promptly as possible after Formation, the Manufacturing Company shall enter into a lease with Parent with respect to the lease of certain real property located in Selby, England adjacent to the existing facility of an Affiliate of Parent (the \"Site\"), which lease will have a term of at least 50 years at an annual rent of $1 and shall grant to the Manufacturing Company all rights necessary to construct and operate the Manufacturing Facility.\n\n3.6. Upon Formation, the Manufacturing Company shall enter into an Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management Agreement in the form set forth in Appendix 3.6 (the \"Construction Agreement\"), pursuant to which Parent shall supervise and manage the construction of the Manufacturing Facility on a turnkey basis in consideration for a payment of $21,614,000. Upon the entering into of the agreements referred to in Articles 3.5 and 3.6, the Operating Company shall capitalize the Manufacturing Company through the contribution of equity received by it from T&L pursuant to Article 3.1 in an amount equal to at least $21,614,000.\n\n3.7. It is the intention of the Parties that any debt incurred by the Joint Venture shall be non-recourse against each Party. Each of the Parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Venture to incur long-term indebtedness in an amount that is consistent with the business and cash desires of the Parties and the cash needs of the Joint Venture; provided, however, that neither Party shall be required to contribute any additional capital or guarantee, directly or indirectly, any debt of the Joint Venture including without limitation any leases or other direct or indirect obligations.\n\n4. PARTIES' INTERESTS IN THE JOINT VENTURE.\n\n4.1. The Parties shall each have a fifty percent (50%) interest in the Operating Company, and control of the Joint Venture shall be shared equally between the Parties. The Parties agree that their respective contributions to the Operating Company have equal value, and that no payment shall be made from one Party to the other Party in the event appraisals performed for tax accounting reasons of the Transferred Assets give rise or would give rise to different valuations.\n\n4.2. All profits and losses earned or incurred by the Operating Company shall be shared by the Parties in equal shares as long as each Party has a 50% interest in the Operating Company. Upon a reduction or increase in such interest, all profits and losses shall be shared in accordance with each Party's ownership interest in the Joint Venture. To the greatest extent permitted by applicable law and accounting provisions, (a) the Operating Company shall make distributions, dividends and returns of capital equally to each of the Parties and (b) Operating Company items of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated equally to each of the Parties; provided, if for any reason, such distributions, dividends, returns of capital or allocations may not be made on an equal basis, the Operating Company shall make a special distribution, dividend, return of capital or allocation to one Party to balance the required distribution, dividend, return of capital or allocation to the other Party.\n\n4.3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if for any reason the contribution of* T&L proves to have a value materially less than that attributed to it at the Effective Date as a result of the Facilities not being constructed as provided herein then either (a) T&L shall contribute a cash amount to the Operating Company to make up the shortfall or (b)(i) T&L's capital account shall be adjusted to reflect the revaluation of its contribution, (ii) T&L's interest in the Operating Company shall be adjusted to reflect its actual proportion of the contributions made upon the formation of the Joint Venture and (iii) the Joint Venture shall be liquidated as provided in Article 22.3.\n\n* Portions intentionally deleted pursuant to a request for confidential treatment.\n\n5. [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]\n\n\n\n\n\n6. TAX CONSIDERATIONS.\n\n6.1. Each Party shall produce and submit to the Board, as promptly as possible, a reasonable estimate of their respective income tax liability with respect to the income of the Operating Company computed pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph as by a reasonably prudent taxpayer attempting to reduce the income tax payable by such taxpayer to the greatest extent permitted by law (a \"Party Tax Estimate\"). A Party Tax Estimate shall be calculated pursuant to United States and/or United Kingdom law and regulations (and the laws and regulations of any other jurisdiction under which the earnings of the Operating Company may be taxable to either Party) as may be applicable to either Party. The tax liability shall be calculated based on each Party's share of the income, gain, costs, expenses and deductions of the Operating Company in the prior year without consideration of items of income, gain, loss or deduction applicable to either Party derived from outside the Operating Company (including, without limitation, with respect to Igene, any Net Operating Loss that Igene may have accumulated prior to the formation of the Joint Venture), but shall include any items of income, gain, loss or deduction derived from the Operating Company in any previous year to the extent applicable to such year. Such Party Tax Estimate shall not be deemed to be final until it is approved by the Board; provided, that if the Board does not approve the higher Tax Estimate, and cannot resolve such a dispute within thirty days of the submission of such Tax Estimate to the Board, then the lesser Tax Estimate (the \"Preliminary Minimum Distribution\") shall be paid to both Parties pursuant to Article 6.2 as if it were the Minimum Distribution. After the expiration of such thirty day period, the Board shall promptly submit the higher Tax Estimate (the \"Disputed Estimate\") to PricewaterhouseCoopers (the \"Neutral Auditor\") who shall evaluate the reasonableness and accuracy of the Disputed Estimate in light of the provisions of this Article 6.1. The Party that submitted the Disputed Estimate shall promptly provide to the Neutral Auditor all information requested by the Neutral Auditor in order to perform the analysis required by this Article 6.1. Within thirty days of receiving all information it deems necessary to perform the analysis required herein, the Neutral Auditor shall inform the Board in writing that it either agrees or disagrees that the Disputed Estimate is reasonable and accurate in light of the provisions of this Article 6.1 and the tax information submitted to it. If the Neutral Auditor concludes that the Disputed Estimate is reasonable and accurate, the difference between the Disputed Estimate and the Preliminary Minimum Distribution shall be promptly paid to each Party. If the Neutral Auditor concludes that the Disputed Estimate is not reasonable and/or accurate then the Preliminary Minimum Distribution shall be deemed the Minimum Distribution for the applicable year; provided, however, that if the Neutral Auditor concludes that an amount greater than the Preliminary Minimum Distribution is appropriate, then such greater amount shall be deemed the Minimum Distribution for the applicable year. The costs of the Neutral Auditor shall be paid equally by the Parties.\n\n6.2. Subject to the provisions of Article 6.1, the Operating Company shall annually declare and pay by March 15 a distribution to each Party equal to the larger of the two estimated annual tax liabilities as reflected on the approved Party Tax Estimates (the \"Minimum Distribution\"). A portion of the Minimum Distribution shall be paid in advance on a quarterly basis should either Party be required to pay periodic mandatory payments of estimated taxes during any given year. In the event that such estimated taxes are required to be paid by either Party, such Party shall notify the Operating Company of the date of such required payments and the Operating Company shall pay to each Party, no later than 5 business days prior to the due date of each quarterly estimated tax payment specified in the notice above, an amount equal to 25% of the estimated Minimum Distribution. In the event that such distributions of estimate taxes are made within a given year, then the distribution on March 15 of the subsequent year shall be adjusted to reflect the advance distributions of related estimated taxes made prior to that date.\n\n6.3. The Operating Company shall annually within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year declare an additional distribution equal to 20% of the net income of the Operating Company, half of which is to be paid to each Party (the \"Target Distribution\"). The Target Distribution shall be paid except when the Board shall determine otherwise.\n\n6.4. The Board may pay other distributions at its discretion.\n\n6.5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Operating Company shall only pay distributions or dividends to the extent permitted by applicable law.\n\n7. PARTIES' WITHDRAWAL FROM THE FIELD OF AGREEMENT.\n\n7.1. Each Party shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, do all such things and shall take all such steps as are reasonably necessary to effect its total withdrawal from the Field of Agreement. Such withdrawal shall be effective from the Effective Date.\n\n7.2. After the Effective Date and as long as Igene and T&L continue to own an interest in the Operating Company, neither of the Parties shall, or shall cause or permit any of their Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, as stockholders, consultants, members, partners or in any other capacity, engage in any enterprise or business anywhere in the world, which (a) manufactures Astaxanthin or (b) develops, markets, or sells products falling within the Field of Agreement. In the event that either (x) one Party shall transfer its entire interest in the Operating Company as permitted pursuant to this Agreement and the Operating Company shall remain a going concern after the closing of such transfer or (y) both Parties sell their interest in the Operating Company as permitted pursuant to this Agreement and the Operating Company shall remain a going concern after the closing of such transfer, then any Party which\n\n\n\n\n\nceases to own an interest in the Operating Company as a result of such transfer shall remain subject to the terms of this Article 7.2 for a period of ten (10) years after the date of such transfer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the obligations set forth in this Article 7.2 are unreasonable in scope, time or geography, such court is hereby authorized by the Parties to enforce such provisions with narrower scope, shorter time or lesser geography as such court determines to be the maximum that is reasonable and proper in the circumstances.\n\n7.3. Except as set forth in Articles 7.1, 7.2, 8.1 and 8.2, it is explicitly agreed that nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent either Party or any of their respective Affiliates from engaging, directly or indirectly, in any enterprise, which develops, manufactures, markets, or sells products that are not within the Field of Agreement, and except as set forth in Articles 7.1, 7.2, 8.1 and 8.2, either Party shall be free to engage in any business, enterprise, or undertaking, or to make any investment it chooses.\n\n8. FUTURE PRODUCTS AND DEVELOPMENTS.\n\n8.1. If, after the date of this Agreement and continuing as long as either Party is a partner, member, or shareholder of the Operating Company, such Party or any of its Affiliates receives or discovers any opportunity within the Field of Agreement, including without limitation developing or completing the development of, or discovering, or acquiring proprietary rights over, a product or process that falls within the Field of Agreement, the Operating Company then shall have exclusive rights to exploit such opportunity, but only within the Field of Agreement. The Party (or its Affiliate) that has developed, discovered or acquired such opportunity, product or process will, however, be entitled to exploit such opportunity, product or process for application outside the Field of Agreement.\n\n8.2. If, after the date of this Agreement and continuing as long as either Party is a partner, member, or shareholder of the Operating Company, such Party or any of its Affiliates receives or discovers any opportunity to use Astaxanthin as a Neutraceutical (a \"Neutraceutical Opportunity\"), including without limitation developing or completing the development of, or discovering, or acquiring proprietary rights over, a product or process that involves the use of Astaxanthin as a Neutraceutical, such Party shall (or shall cause its Affiliate to) present such opportunity to the Operating Company, providing the Operating Company with such narrative description and budgetary and other information as such Party (or its Affiliates) may have generated or gathered to the extent necessary to evaluate such Neutraceutical Opportunity. The Board shall consider the material presented by such Party and its Affiliates and shall elect whether the Joint Venture should pursue such Neutraceutical Opportunity. If the Board elects to pursue such Neutraceutical Opportunity, the Operating Company then shall have exclusive rights to exploit such Neutraceutical Opportunity, but solely with respect to use of Astaxanthin as a Neutraceutical, and, subject to Article 8.1, the Party (or its Affiliate) that has developed, discovered or acquired such opportunity, product or process will, however, be entitled to exploit such opportunity, product or process for application outside of use of Astaxanthin as a Neutraceutical. If however the Board does not elect to pursue such Neutraceutical Opportunity, the Party (or its Affiliate) that has developed, discovered or acquired such opportunity, product or process shall, subject to Article 8.1, be entitled to exploit such opportunity, product or process; provided, that subsequent developments or discoveries with respect to such Neutraceutical Opportunity would reasonably be expected to affect the Board's acceptance or rejection of such Neutraceutical Opportunity, such Party shall (or shall cause its Affiliate to) present such Neutraceutical Opportunity to the Board with reference to the pertinent subsequent developments or discoveries.\n\n8.3. If, after the date of this Agreement and continuing as long as a Party is a partner, member, or shareholder of the Operating Company, the Joint Venture develops or completes the development of, or discovers, or acquires proprietary rights over, a process or product which at, or after, the time of its development, discovery or acquisition has, or might have, some application outside of the Field of Agreement, then the appropriate entity of the Joint Venture shall offer to license the use of the process or product (or the production thereof) for such application to each of the Parties on reasonable commercial terms (including, without limitation, the possible payment of royalties at market rates) taking into account the time and money spent by the Joint Venture and taking into account other relevant commercial factors. The grant of licenses to any third parties shall be the prerogative of the Board provided that no such license shall be granted at terms more favorable to the third party than were offered to the member(s) of such Party.\n\n8.4. In the event either T&L or Igene wishes to market Astaxanthin for uses other than in the Field of Agreement, including but not limited to the use of Astaxanthin as a neutraceutical or otherwise for direct human consumption, either T&L or Igene, as the case may be, shall be permitted to purchase reasonable quantities of Astaxanthin from the Operating Company for use in the manufacture of such products at the Average Market Price. The Joint Venture will manufacture such Astaxanthin to the standard required for its business, and each Party desiring to market Astaxanthin for other uses shall process the product acquired from the Operating Company at its own cost and expense.\n\n9. MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL OF THE JOINT VENTURE.\n\n9.1. The Joint Venture will be managed and controlled by a board of directors comprised of six (6) members (the \"Board\"). Each Party shall appoint three (3) of such members (none of whom shall be residents of the United Kingdom) and shall be entitled to\n\n\n\n\n\nappoint any successor appointees as necessary such that the Board shall always be comprised of three members appointed by each Party. Each Party shall be entitled to appoint alternate directors on a periodic and temporary basis as needed. Each party agrees at all times to vote in favor of the directors appointed by the other Party or any successor appointees.\n\n9.2. The Board shall have a Chairman selected in odd-numbered years by Igene and in even-numbered years by T&L for the duration of the calendar year. The Party with the right to select the Chairman shall select the Chairman from among the members of the Board appointed by it. If for any reason the individual serving as the Chairman ceases to be a member of the Board, such individual shall also cease to serve as Chairman and the Party who appointed such individual to the Board may select another individual appointed by that Party to the Board to serve as Chairman through the remainder of such calendar year. The Chairman shall serve as the chairman of all meetings of the Board and shall serve in such other administrative capacities as may be appropriate or as the Board may determine from time to time, but the Chairman shall not have any additional vote or authority by virtue of being the Chairman.\n\n9.3. The Board shall have regular meetings at least once each calendar quarter which shall be called by the Chairman by written notice delivered to each Board member no later than five business days prior to the meeting specifying the date, time and place for such meeting. Either Party may at any time provide the Chairman with a written request that the Chairman convene a special meeting, whereupon the Chairman shall call a special meeting to be held within two weeks after receipt of such request by written notice delivered to each Board member no later than five business days prior to the meeting specifying the date, time and place for such meeting. Any member of the Board may attend a meeting by telephonic equipment if such member may hear and be heard by all present at that meeting (including others participating telephonically).\n\n9.4. The decisions of the Board shall be by majority vote of the members present at a meeting, provided that such majority vote includes the affirmative vote of at least one member appointed by each Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after either Party either has an Event of Bankruptcy or is and continues to be in material breach of this Agreement (unless such breach is being contested by the breaching party in good faith) and no director appointed by such Party attends a duly convened meeting of the Board (after notice delivered pursuant to Article 9.3), the affirmative vote of three members of the Board at a duly convened meeting of the Board shall constitute approval of the Board for all purposes hereunder, regardless of whether a member of the Board appointed by each Party approves such matter.\n\n9.5. The Board shall establish various authorizations and delegations for Management (as described below) to conduct the business of the Joint Venture as contemplated by Article 1.1 hereof. In addition, the Board shall:\n\n(a) select the officer who will manage the Joint Venture on a day-to-day basis (the \"General Manager\") subject to the direction of the Board who need not be an employee of the Joint Venture;\n\n(b) approve any and all individual capital investments to be made by the Joint Venture in excess of $50,000 or, at its discretion, delegate such approval to the General Manager with respect to capital investments that do not exceed amounts to be determined by the Board in such delegation;\n\n(c) approve any dividend or profit distribution to be made to the shareholders, members or partners, as the case may be, in excess of the Minimum Distribution in accordance with Article 6.2;\n\n(d) approve any merger of the Operating Company or any acquisition of another entity or all or substantially all of another entity's assets by the Operating Company;\n\n(e) the sale, disposition or purchase of individual assets for in excess of $50,000;\n\n(f) approve the closing of any plant or facility of the Joint Venture;\n\n(g) approve any related-party contracts, except as contemplated in this Agreement;\n\n(h) approve any incurrence of indebtedness for borrowed money;\n\n(i) change the business purpose of the Joint Venture;\n\n(j) approve the discontinuance of any operations of the Joint Venture;\n\n(k) determine the annual business plan and budget (including capital expenditures) and any material variance from such plan and budget;\n\n\n\n\n\n(l) approve any contract or commitment for a period greater than twelve months;\n\n(m) approve any capacity increase at any manufacturing site;\n\n(n) determine budgets for continuing research concerning the development of strains and process methods for Astaxanthin;\n\n(o) approve the material tax and accounting policies of the Joint Venture (which shall include for the Operating Company the application of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles); and\n\n(p) approve the issuance of new or additional interests in the Operating Company (but not including, in any case, any transfer of existing interests as otherwise provided herein).\n\nIf the Board should be deadlocked on any matter, the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Article 22.1 shall apply.\n\n9.6. The Joint Venture shall be jointly controlled by the Parties who, as shareholders, members, or partners, shall have the exclusive power, by instructing the Board, to: (i) dissolve the Joint Venture, (ii) sell, or dispose of all or substantially all assets of the Joint Venture or permit the Joint Venture to place or grant any consensual lien or security interest on its assets (except liens for taxes and materialsmen's liens being contested in good faith which are not material in amount), or (iii) permit the Joint Venture to engage in material commerce outside the Field of Agreement or change the scope of the Field of Agreement. Upon receipt of such instructions, the Board shall act in accordance with this Article 9.\n\n10. DAY-TO-DAY MANAGEMENT OF THE JOINT VENTURE.\n\n10.1. Except as provided in Article 9.5, the Board shall delegate the conduct of the day-to-day business of the Joint Venture to the General Manager, together with the officers and employees of the companies providing the services set forth in Article 11 (collectively the \"Management\"). The General Manager shall also have whatever title is appropriate for each entity in the Joint Venture reflecting his or her role as the primary manager and officer of each entity. The initial General Manager will be Peter Boynton who will be secunded to the Joint Venture on a part-time basis.\n\n10.2. Subject to Article 9.5 and the direction of the Board, the Management shall direct, supervise and conduct the business of the Joint Venture in the following areas:\n\n(a) creation, development, and implementation of routine commercial policies and procedures;\n\n(b) creation, development, and implementation of sales and marketing strategies;\n\n(c) treasury and financial management;\n\n(d) manufacturing, maintenance and other operations;\n\n(e) legal services; and\n\n(f) research and development.\n\n11.

Contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, each Party will enter into an agreement or agreements substantially in the form attached hereto as Appendix 11.1.1 and Appendix 11.1.2 pursuant to which each Party or its Affiliates shall provide the services identified for it below (the \"Support Services Agreements\", and each a \"Support Services Agreement\"). The Support Services Agreements shall provide that the parties will provide the following services to the Joint Venture:\n\n11.1.1.Igene or its Affiliates will provide to the Joint Venture:\n\n(i) Sales and marketing services related to the world-wide sale and marketing of Astaxanthin in the Field of Agreement;\n\n(ii) Research services related to further development of the Technology and improvement of manufacturing process efficiencies, as requested by the Board from time-to-time; and\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii) Administration of the contract for manufacturing of Axtaxanthin with Fermic S.A. de Mexico pursuant to the terms of the Support Services Agreement.\n\n11.1.2.T&L or its Affiliates will provide to the Joint Venture:\n\n(i) Engineering and operations services;\n\n(ii) Technical and research services related to the further development of the Technology and improvement of manufacturing process efficiencies, as requested by the Board from time-to-time;\n\n(iii) Transportation and logistics services; and\n\n(iv) Finance and accounting services.\n\n11.1.3.The charge for the services set forth in Article 11.1.1 and 11.1.2 is set forth in the appropriate Support Services Agreement and shall be paid by the Operating Company.\n\n11.1.4.T&L or its Affiliates shall also provide certain utilities and waste treatment services to the Joint Venture from its existing facility located at the Site. Such services shall be reimbursed by the Operating Company in an amount as more fully set forth in the appropriate Support Services Agreement.\n\n11.2. In the event that either Party conveys its interest in the Operating Company to the other or a third party during the five year period commencing on the Effective Date and the Joint Venture continues to operate as a going concern thereafter, each Party shall provide the services described in Article 11.1 to the Joint Venture at a price (that shall reasonably be consistent with the methodology used for determining prices prior to such conveyance) to be agreed upon by the Parties for a transition period to allow the owner or owners of the Operating Company to obtain such services for the Joint Venture independently. Such transition period shall not exceed 24 months for the services set forth in Article 11.1.1 and Article 11.1.2 and shall not exceed 36 months for the services set forth in Article 11.1.4; provided, however, if T&L shall give notice to Igene that it intends to close the Selby, England facility adjacent to the Site, T&L shall be required to provide the services set forth in Article 11.1.4 for a period not to exceed 24 months from the date Igene receives such notice.\n\n11.3. In the event of a contradiction between the terms of this Article 11 and any Support Services Agreement, the terms of the Support Services Agreement shall govern.\n\n12. RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL; TERMINATION OF THE JOINT VENTURE AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n12.1. RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL; TAG-ALONG RIGHTS.\n\nPrior to one year from the Effective Date, a Party may not sell or otherwise transfer its interest in the Operating Company. Thereafter, any sale or other transfer may not be effectuated except pursuant to a good faith, arms' length offer to sell its entire ownership interest in the Operating Company for cash consideration to a party who is not affiliated with such Party (a \"Third Party Offer\"). If either Party has received a Third Party Offer that it intends to accept (the \"Offer\"), such Party (the \"Selling Party\") shall notify the other Party (the \"Offeree\") of the Offer, which notice shall include a copy of the Offer and any other information necessary to enable the Offeree to evaluate reasonably the Offer and the potential purchaser. The Offeree shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice from the Selling Party (the \"Option Period\") to elect either (i) to purchase the Selling Party's interest in the Operating Company or (ii) to sell the Offeree's interest in the Operating Company to the Selling Party, in either case on the same terms and conditions as those contained in the Offer. If the Offeree makes one of such elections, the applicable purchase and sale shall take place within sixty (60) days after the date of the Offeree's election in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Offer or such other terms and conditions as the Selling Party and the Offeree shall mutually agree. If the Offeree does not make one of such elections within the Option Period, the Selling Party shall have the right to sell its interest to the person or entity who made the Third Party Offer for cash consideration only on terms and conditions no more favorable to such person or entity within sixty (60) days after the expiration of the Option Period. If such sale is not completed within such sixty (60) day period, the offer from the Selling Party shall be deemed to have been revoked and any subsequent offer from such Selling Party shall be subject to the right of first refusal described herein.\n\n12.2. TERMINATION OF THE JOINT VENTURE.\n\n(a) If there is an Event of Bankruptcy with respect to either Party, then the other Party may elect either to terminate the Joint\n\n\n\n\n\nVenture (and follow the liquidation procedures set forth in Article 22.3) or to purchase the interest of the Party who had an Event of Bankruptcy for a purchase price equal to the market value of such interest as determined pursuant to subsection (c). Such election shall occur within 60 days after the Event of Bankruptcy unless prohibited by a bankruptcy court or other court of competent jurisdiction; provided that once any such prohibition is no longer applicable, such election shall occur promptly thereafter. The other Party shall provide written notice to the Party who had an Event of Bankruptcy upon the election of the other Party, which notice shall specify the effective date of the action elected by the other Party.\n\n(b) If the Parties shall agree to terminate the Joint Venture pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Parties agree to terminate the Joint Venture and follow the liquidation procedures set forth in Article 22.3 unless the Parties otherwise agree.\n\n(c) Upon delivery by either Party of such Party's election to purchase the interest of the other Party upon the other Party having an Event of Bankruptcy, the Board shall meet for the purpose of retaining a mutually acceptable, qualified investment banking, accounting or appraisal firm of national reputation with no conflict of interest with respect to either Party or any Affiliate thereof (a \"Qualified Expert\") to determine the market value of the Operating Company. If the Board is unable to select by unanimous agreement a single Qualified Expert, then the appraisal shall be arrived at by mutual agreement of two Qualified Experts, one selected by each Party. If in such an instance either Party shall fail to appoint a Qualified Expert within fifteen (15) days after a written request to do so, such failure shall be deemed acceptance of the conclusions and appraisal of such Qualified Expert as has been appointed. If the Board unanimously selects a single Qualified Expert, the value of the Operating Company as determined by such Qualified Expert shall be final and binding upon both of the Parties. If two Qualified Experts are chosen, one by each Party, and such Qualified Experts either agree or the greater of the two valuations is no more than 110% of the lesser valuation, the average of the valuations of the Operating Company as determined by each such Qualified Expert shall be the value of the Operating Company for the purposes of this Article 12.2 and shall be final and binding upon both Parties. If two Qualified Experts are chosen, one by each Party, and such Qualified Experts cannot agree within thirty (30) days of the appointment of the second of such Qualified Expert (or their valuations differ by more than 10%), then (i) the two appointed Qualified Experts shall select a third Qualified Expert, (ii) if the determination of any of the three Qualified Experts is greater than the two smallest determinations or smaller than the two greatest determinations, in either case by more than 125% of the difference between such other determinations, such determination will be disregarded and the average of the two remaining determinations shall be final and binding upon both of the Parties and (iii) otherwise, the average of the three determinations of the three Qualified Experts shall be final and binding upon both of the Parties. The market value for the interest of the Party who has had an Event of Bankruptcy shall equal the market value of the Operating Company as determined above times the interest of such Party in the Operating Company as stated in Article 4.1.\n\n13. LIABILITIES.\n\n13.1. Igene (the \"Indemnifying Party\") shall indemnify and hold harmless T&L, its Affiliates, the Operating Company and the Manufacturing Company, and their respective officers, directors, shareholders and agents (collectively, the \"Indemnified Parties\") from and against any and all claims, demands, actions, lawsuits, proceedings, liabilities, losses, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and disbursements incurred by any of the Indemnified Parties in respect of any such claims, demands, actions, lawsuits or proceedings) arising from any actual or alleged infringement of any patent, trademark, trade name, trade dress, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary right (whether under the laws of any country or of the European Union) resulting from the ownership or use of the Technology by Igene or as contemplated herein, including without limitation a failure of the Operating Company to have unencumbered rights in the Technology as a result of the pending lawsuit (the \"Lawsuit\") styled Archer Daniels Midland Corporation v. Igene Biotechnology, Inc., United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Case No. S97-2358, or any similar claim.\n\n*\n\n* Intentionally deleted pursuant to a request for confidential treatment.\n\n14.

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.\n\n21.1. THIRD PARTIES. Except as expressly stated herein with respect to members of each Party, no person or entity not a Party to this Agreement (including, without limitation, any employee of either Party or the Joint Venture) shall be a third-party beneficiary of any provision of this Agreement, and nothing contained herein shall be construed or deemed to confer any benefit or right upon any third party.\n\n21.2.

ENTIRE AGREEMENT; CONFIDENTIALITY.\n\nA. This Agreement, including the Appendices attached to this Agreement and the Recitals set forth herein, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and all prior representations, discussions and negotiations between the Parties and/or their representatives pertaining to the subject matter of this Agreement are superseded. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the terms and provisions of the certain Nondisclosure Agreement dated as of March 19, 2001 as amended August 5, 2002 between the Parties shall remain in effect.\n\nB. Each Party (the \"Recipient Party\") agrees to hold in confidence and not to disclose either directly or indirectly to any third party any technical, financial, commercial or other information (the \"Information\") as may be revealed or disclosed orally, in writing or otherwise to it by the other Party or by the Joint Venture (the \"Disclosing Party\") and shall refrain from using any such Information for any purpose whatsoever other than for the purpose(s) for which the Information was disclosed or unless previously approved in writing by the Disclosing Party; provided, however, that these obligations shall not apply to Information:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) which at the time of disclosure to the Recipient Party was in the public domain,\n\n(ii) which after disclosure to the Recipient Party becomes part of the public domain through no fault of said Party,\n\n(iii) which at the time of disclosure to the Recipient Party was in its possession or was independently developed by the Recipient Party (and the Recipient Party can demonstrate such by written documents dated before the time of disclosure),\n\n(iv) which disclosure is obtained by the Recipient Party from a third party which has not, either directly or indirectly, received the Information from the Disclosing Party; or\n\n(v) which disclosure is required otherwise by law, unless compelled to disclose such documents or information by judicial or administrative process.\n\nSpecific Information shall not be deemed to be within the foregoing exceptions merely because such specific Information may be construed as being within broader, non- confidential information which is either in the public domain or in the possession of the Receiving Party at the time of the disclosure of such Information, nor shall a combination of features which form Information be deemed to be non-confidential merely because the individual features, without being combined, are non-confidential. In any such instance where disclosure appears to be compelled by law, the first Party will notify the other Party so that such Party may avail itself of such measures as may be available for protecting the confidentiality of such information; provided, however, that neither Party will be prohibited from using such documents and information in litigation against the other Party.\n\nC. The Parties shall cause the Operating Company and the Manufacturing Company to adhere to similar obligations of confidentiality as set forth above with respect to Information received by it from either Party.\n\nD. Unless otherwise agreed between the Parties, the provisions of this clause shall survive the termination of this Agreement and continue to be in force thereafter for a period of five (5) years.\n\n21.5. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Signatures to this Agreement may be given by facsimile or other electronic transmission, and such signatures shall be fully binding on the Party sending the same.\n\n21.6. AMENDMENT; WAIVER; HEADINGS. No waiver, modification or amendment of any provision, term, or condition of this Agreement shall be of any force or effect unless in writing and executed by each of the Parties.

From time to time, each Party shall have the right to have its own internal or external auditors review the books and records of the Joint Venture.\n\n21.8. SUPREMACY. Other than as set forth in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and any other document related to the subject matter of this Agreement, which may be entered into by the Parties or between a member of any Party and the Joint Venture, from time to time, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail in each case, unless the Parties otherwise expressly agree in writing.\n\n21.9. TAX MATTERS. Each Party shall prepare its tax reports and returns in a manner not inconsistent with the tax reports and returns of the Operating Company, except in the case of manifest error.\n\n21.10. GUARANTEE. Parent hereby guarantees the performance by T&L of all of its obligations hereunder.\n\n22. DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES; LIQUIDATION.\n\n22.1. At any time for so long as both T&L and Igene own an interest in the Operating Company, at the request of either Party in a written notice to the other Party's appointees to the Board, the Parties agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve expeditiously any controversies, claims or disputes between the Parties that may arise from time to time under this Agreement or otherwise relating to the Joint Venture (each a \"Board Dispute\"). If, after a Board Dispute is addressed and recorded in the minutes in two regular\n\n\n\n\n\nquarterly Board meetings without resolution of such Board Dispute, then any such matter not so resolved shall be referred (by written notice by either Party to the other Party's general counsel and the other Party's appointees to the Board) to the Party Heads, who shall have an initial meeting with respect to such matters within ten days of the date of such referral notice, and who shall thereafter negotiate in good faith with each other for an additional twenty day period following the date of such initial meeting in an attempt to resolve any open issues.\n\n22.2. If any Board Dispute is not resolved through the procedure set forth in Article 22.1 after expiration of all of the time specified therefor, either Party, in the thirty day period beginning upon the end of the twenty day period described in Article 22.1, may provide the other Party with a written notice (the \"Offer Notice\") stating that such Board Dispute is not resolved and setting forth a price (the \"Offer Price\") and a list of three acceptable closing dates not less than ninety days after the expiration of the twenty-one day period referred to in the next sentence; provided, that an Offer Notice may not be served earlier than (i) with respect to a Board Dispute arising pursuant to Article 9.5(a) (General Manager Appointment), 9.5(k) (Operating Plans) (except as provided in subclause (ii) below), eighteen months from the Commencement Date, (ii) a Board Dispute arising pursuant to Article 9.5(b) (Capital Expenditures) or 9.5(k) (Operating Plans) that involves a contemplated expenditure which can be financed solely by the Joint Venture from its internal resources and/or using funds provided on normal commercial terms by any other party without any contribution or guaranty from either Party, eighteen months from the Commencement Date and (iii) with respect to any other Board Dispute, fifty-four months from the Effective Date. Upon receipt of an Offer Notice, the other Party must elect prior to the expiration of twenty-one days either to (a) sell its interest in the Operating Company for the Offer Price or (b) purchase the interest of the Party providing the Offer Notice for the Offer Price, which election in either case may be in a written notice which also specifies which of the closing dates identified in the notice delivered to such Party is preferred by such Party. On the closing date specified in the response notice, the Parties shall consummate the transaction selected in the response notice unless both Parties expressly agree otherwise. The Party initiating the notice provided herein, shall be required to provide such Support Services as agreed in the appropriate Support Services Agreement described in Article 11.1 to the surviving entity at a price (that shall be reasonably consistent with the methodology used for determining prices prior to such conveyance) to be agreed upon by the Parties for a transition period to allow the Operating Company to continue to obtain such services. Such transition period shall not exceed 12 months for the services set forth in Article 11.1.1 and Article 11.1.2 and shall not exceed 24 months for the services set forth in Article 11.1.4. The Party whose interest in the Operating Company is purchased shall take all reasonable steps to cooperate in the transition with the other Party so that the Joint Venture will be able to continue as an independent and functioning business after termination of the Support Services. For all purposes under this Article 22.2, if each Party delivers an Offer Notice to the other Party, the Offer Notice that is received on the earliest date shall be effective. If each Party receives an Offer Notice from the other Party on the same date, then the Offer Notice containing the highest cash Offer Price shall be effective.\n\n22.3. In the event the Parties (a) agree to liquidate the Joint Venture, (b) are required to liquidate the Joint Venture pursuant to Article 12.2 or (c) do not send any notice under Article 22.2 in the period allowed therefor, either Party may, by notice to the Board of such circumstance (the \"Liquidation Notice\"), commence the following liquidation process. Upon the Board's receipt of a Liquidation Notice, the Board shall meet to determine how to proceed. The Board may retain or appoint a Qualified Expert or any other person to value the Joint Venture and to advise it in liquidating the Joint Venture. Each Party may also retain or appoint such advisors and experts as it may deem appropriate to advise such Party with respect to the liquidation of the Joint Venture. From and after the Board's receipt of a Liquidation Notice, the Board shall proceed with the liquidation of the Joint Venture, and shall have no authority and shall not continue the regular operations of the Joint Venture except to the extent necessary or appropriate to preserve or increase the value of the assets of the Joint Venture; provided that, the Board may elect to, and upon express election by the Board thereby shall, for a specified period not to exceed six months, continue regular operations of the Joint Venture solely for the purpose of preserving its value while seeking to sell the Joint Venture as a whole, but if such period expires prior to the sale of the Joint Venture as a whole, the Board shall thereafter be required to sell the assets of the Operating Company reasonably expeditiously. The proceeds of any such liquidation shall be first used to pay the fees and expenses of the Qualified Experts and all remaining proceeds after payment of such fees shall be distributed between the Parties in proportion to their respective capital accounts.\n\n23. JOINT VENTURE TO BE BOUND.\n\nOn the Formation Date, each of the Parties shall cause the Joint Venture (and each of its constituent entities) to agree to and be irrevocably bound by the terms and provisions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, Article 13.\n\n[remainder of page intentionally left blank]\n\nIN WITNESS of the foregoing, the Parties have signed this Agreement as to the date first written above.\n\nTATE & LYLE FERMENTATION PRODUCTS LTD.

JOINT VENTURE TO BE BOUND 24\n\nJOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT\n\nThis Joint Venture Agreement (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified in accordance herewith, this \"Agreement\") is entered into as of March 18, 2003 and is by and between Tate & Lyle Fermentation Products Ltd., a corporation organized under the laws of England (\"T&L\") and a subsidiary of Tate & Lyle PLC, and Igene Biotechnology, Inc., a Maryland corporation (\"Igene\"; collectively with T&L, the \"Parties\").\n\nRECITALS\n\nA. Igene owns certain technology and expertise related to the manufacture and sale of Astaxanthin and derivative products, and T&L and its subsidiaries and affiliates possess expertise with respect to all aspects of the manufacture and production of numerous products through fermentation.\n\nB. In an effort to capitalize on their respective strengths and expertise, Igene and T&L wish to form a joint venture to manufacture and sell Astaxanthin and derivative products worldwide, all in accordance with the principles set out in this Agreement (including each of its relevant constituent entities, the \"Joint Venture\"). The Parties anticipate that the primary market for the product of the Joint Venture will initially be limited to Chile, parts of Europe, Japan and other parts of Asia.\n\nC.

The Parties agree to use commercially reasonable good faith efforts to negotiate with any applicable governmental authority in order to avoid any such limitations.\n\n3. PARTIES' CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE JOINT VENTURE AND FINANCING.\n\n3.1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, T&L shall contribute, or cause to be contributed, to the Operating Company cash in the amount of $21,614,000. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, T&L further agrees to pay to Operating Company as a contribution to capital upon Formation (as defined below) $3,000,000.\n\n3.2. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Igene shall transfer and assign, or cause to be transferred and assigned,\n\n\n\n\n\nto the Operating Company the Transferred Assets described in Appendix 3.2.\n\n3.3. The Parties intend that the transfer of the Transferred Assets to the Operating Company pursuant to Articles 3.1 and 3.2 and the other various transactions, transfers, contributions and agreements to be made or entered by and between Igene or T&L and the Operating Company in connection with the formation of the Joint Venture, shall be made promptly upon the formation of both the Operating Company and the Manufacturing Company (\"Formation\"). In the event that the Transferred Assets are not transferred to the Operating Company at such time or on such other date as is specified herein or in the Asset Transfer Agreement, the entity who is to make such transfer(s) shall, without any further cost to the Joint Venture or to the other Party, (a) ensure that the Joint Venture shall have all of the benefits and bear all of the burdens of such assets on and from Formation and (b) fully and legally assign to the Operating Company such assets as soon after Formation as practicable.\n\n3.4. Title to the Transferred Assets shall be passed to the Operating Company in accordance with Asset Transfer Agreement to be entered into by the Operating Company and Igene upon Formation. Such Asset Transfer Agreement shall be in the form set forth in Appendix 3.4. Such Transferred Assets shall be contributed free and clear of any and all indebtedness, liens and encumbrances.\n\n3.5. As promptly as possible after Formation, the Manufacturing Company shall enter into a lease with Parent with respect to the lease of certain real property located in Selby, England adjacent to the existing facility of an Affiliate of Parent (the \"Site\"), which lease will have a term of at least 50 years at an annual rent of $1 and shall grant to the Manufacturing Company all rights necessary to construct and operate the Manufacturing Facility.\n\n3.6. Upon Formation, the Manufacturing Company shall enter into an Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management Agreement in the form set forth in Appendix 3.6 (the \"Construction Agreement\"), pursuant to which Parent shall supervise and manage the construction of the Manufacturing Facility on a turnkey basis in consideration for a payment of $21,614,000. Upon the entering into of the agreements referred to in Articles 3.5 and 3.6, the Operating Company shall capitalize the Manufacturing Company through the contribution of equity received by it from T&L pursuant to Article 3.1 in an amount equal to at least $21,614,000.\n\n3.7. It is the intention of the Parties that any debt incurred by the Joint Venture shall be non-recourse against each Party. Each of the Parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Venture to incur long-term indebtedness in an amount that is consistent with the business and cash desires of the Parties and the cash needs of the Joint Venture; provided, however, that neither Party shall be required to contribute any additional capital or guarantee, directly or indirectly, any debt of the Joint Venture including without limitation any leases or other direct or indirect obligations.\n\n4. PARTIES' INTERESTS IN THE JOINT VENTURE.\n\n4.1. The Parties shall each have a fifty percent (50%) interest in the Operating Company, and control of the Joint Venture shall be shared equally between the Parties. The Parties agree that their respective contributions to the Operating Company have equal value, and that no payment shall be made from one Party to the other Party in the event appraisals performed for tax accounting reasons of the Transferred Assets give rise or would give rise to different valuations.\n\n4.2. All profits and losses earned or incurred by the Operating Company shall be shared by the Parties in equal shares as long as each Party has a 50% interest in the Operating Company. Upon a reduction or increase in such interest, all profits and losses shall be shared in accordance with each Party's ownership interest in the Joint Venture. To the greatest extent permitted by applicable law and accounting provisions, (a) the Operating Company shall make distributions, dividends and returns of capital equally to each of the Parties and (b) Operating Company items of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated equally to each of the Parties; provided, if for any reason, such distributions, dividends, returns of capital or allocations may not be made on an equal basis, the Operating Company shall make a special distribution, dividend, return of capital or allocation to one Party to balance the required distribution, dividend, return of capital or allocation to the other Party.\n\n4.3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if for any reason the contribution of* T&L proves to have a value materially less than that attributed to it at the Effective Date as a result of the Facilities not being constructed as provided herein then either (a) T&L shall contribute a cash amount to the Operating Company to make up the shortfall or (b)(i) T&L's capital account shall be adjusted to reflect the revaluation of its contribution, (ii) T&L's interest in the Operating Company shall be adjusted to reflect its actual proportion of the contributions made upon the formation of the Joint Venture and (iii) the Joint Venture shall be liquidated as provided in Article 22.3.\n\n* Portions intentionally deleted pursuant to a request for confidential treatment.\n\n5. [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]\n\n\n\n\n\n6. TAX CONSIDERATIONS.\n\n6.1. Each Party shall produce and submit to the Board, as promptly as possible, a reasonable estimate of their respective income tax liability with respect to the income of the Operating Company computed pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph as by a reasonably prudent taxpayer attempting to reduce the income tax payable by such taxpayer to the greatest extent permitted by law (a \"Party Tax Estimate\"). A Party Tax Estimate shall be calculated pursuant to United States and/or United Kingdom law and regulations (and the laws and regulations of any other jurisdiction under which the earnings of the Operating Company may be taxable to either Party) as may be applicable to either Party. The tax liability shall be calculated based on each Party's share of the income, gain, costs, expenses and deductions of the Operating Company in the prior year without consideration of items of income, gain, loss or deduction applicable to either Party derived from outside the Operating Company (including, without limitation, with respect to Igene, any Net Operating Loss that Igene may have accumulated prior to the formation of the Joint Venture), but shall include any items of income, gain, loss or deduction derived from the Operating Company in any previous year to the extent applicable to such year. Such Party Tax Estimate shall not be deemed to be final until it is approved by the Board; provided, that if the Board does not approve the higher Tax Estimate, and cannot resolve such a dispute within thirty days of the submission of such Tax Estimate to the Board, then the lesser Tax Estimate (the \"Preliminary Minimum Distribution\") shall be paid to both Parties pursuant to Article 6.2 as if it were the Minimum Distribution. After the expiration of such thirty day period, the Board shall promptly submit the higher Tax Estimate (the \"Disputed Estimate\") to PricewaterhouseCoopers (the \"Neutral Auditor\") who shall evaluate the reasonableness and accuracy of the Disputed Estimate in light of the provisions of this Article 6.1. The Party that submitted the Disputed Estimate shall promptly provide to the Neutral Auditor all information requested by the Neutral Auditor in order to perform the analysis required by this Article 6.1. Within thirty days of receiving all information it deems necessary to perform the analysis required herein, the Neutral Auditor shall inform the Board in writing that it either agrees or disagrees that the Disputed Estimate is reasonable and accurate in light of the provisions of this Article 6.1 and the tax information submitted to it. If the Neutral Auditor concludes that the Disputed Estimate is reasonable and accurate, the difference between the Disputed Estimate and the Preliminary Minimum Distribution shall be promptly paid to each Party. If the Neutral Auditor concludes that the Disputed Estimate is not reasonable and/or accurate then the Preliminary Minimum Distribution shall be deemed the Minimum Distribution for the applicable year; provided, however, that if the Neutral Auditor concludes that an amount greater than the Preliminary Minimum Distribution is appropriate, then such greater amount shall be deemed the Minimum Distribution for the applicable year. The costs of the Neutral Auditor shall be paid equally by the Parties.\n\n6.2. Subject to the provisions of Article 6.1, the Operating Company shall annually declare and pay by March 15 a distribution to each Party equal to the larger of the two estimated annual tax liabilities as reflected on the approved Party Tax Estimates (the \"Minimum Distribution\"). A portion of the Minimum Distribution shall be paid in advance on a quarterly basis should either Party be required to pay periodic mandatory payments of estimated taxes during any given year. In the event that such estimated taxes are required to be paid by either Party, such Party shall notify the Operating Company of the date of such required payments and the Operating Company shall pay to each Party, no later than 5 business days prior to the due date of each quarterly estimated tax payment specified in the notice above, an amount equal to 25% of the estimated Minimum Distribution. In the event that such distributions of estimate taxes are made within a given year, then the distribution on March 15 of the subsequent year shall be adjusted to reflect the advance distributions of related estimated taxes made prior to that date.\n\n6.3. The Operating Company shall annually within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year declare an additional distribution equal to 20% of the net income of the Operating Company, half of which is to be paid to each Party (the \"Target Distribution\"). The Target Distribution shall be paid except when the Board shall determine otherwise.\n\n6.4. The Board may pay other distributions at its discretion.\n\n6.5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Operating Company shall only pay distributions or dividends to the extent permitted by applicable law.\n\n7. PARTIES' WITHDRAWAL FROM THE FIELD OF AGREEMENT.\n\n7.1. Each Party shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, do all such things and shall take all such steps as are reasonably necessary to effect its total withdrawal from the Field of Agreement. Such withdrawal shall be effective from the Effective Date.\n\n7.2. After the Effective Date and as long as Igene and T&L continue to own an interest in the Operating Company, neither of the Parties shall, or shall cause or permit any of their Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, as stockholders, consultants, members, partners or in any other capacity, engage in any enterprise or business anywhere in the world, which (a) manufactures Astaxanthin or (b) develops, markets, or sells products falling within the Field of Agreement. In the event that either (x) one Party shall transfer its entire interest in the Operating Company as permitted pursuant to this Agreement and the Operating Company shall remain a going concern after the closing of such transfer or (y) both Parties sell their interest in the Operating Company as permitted pursuant to this Agreement and the Operating Company shall remain a going concern after the closing of such transfer, then any Party which\n\n\n\n\n\nceases to own an interest in the Operating Company as a result of such transfer shall remain subject to the terms of this Article 7.2 for a period of ten (10) years after the date of such transfer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the obligations set forth in this Article 7.2 are unreasonable in scope, time or geography, such court is hereby authorized by the Parties to enforce such provisions with narrower scope, shorter time or lesser geography as such court determines to be the maximum that is reasonable and proper in the circumstances.\n\n7.3. Except as set forth in Articles 7.1, 7.2, 8.1 and 8.2, it is explicitly agreed that nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent either Party or any of their respective Affiliates from engaging, directly or indirectly, in any enterprise, which develops, manufactures, markets, or sells products that are not within the Field of Agreement, and except as set forth in Articles 7.1, 7.2, 8.1 and 8.2, either Party shall be free to engage in any business, enterprise, or undertaking, or to make any investment it chooses.\n\n8. FUTURE PRODUCTS AND DEVELOPMENTS.\n\n8.1. If, after the date of this Agreement and continuing as long as either Party is a partner, member, or shareholder of the Operating Company, such Party or any of its Affiliates receives or discovers any opportunity within the Field of Agreement, including without limitation developing or completing the development of, or discovering, or acquiring proprietary rights over, a product or process that falls within the Field of Agreement, the Operating Company then shall have exclusive rights to exploit such opportunity, but only within the Field of Agreement. The Party (or its Affiliate) that has developed, discovered or acquired such opportunity, product or process will, however, be entitled to exploit such opportunity, product or process for application outside the Field of Agreement.\n\n8.2. If, after the date of this Agreement and continuing as long as either Party is a partner, member, or shareholder of the Operating Company, such Party or any of its Affiliates receives or discovers any opportunity to use Astaxanthin as a Neutraceutical (a \"Neutraceutical Opportunity\"), including without limitation developing or completing the development of, or discovering, or acquiring proprietary rights over, a product or process that involves the use of Astaxanthin as a Neutraceutical, such Party shall (or shall cause its Affiliate to) present such opportunity to the Operating Company, providing the Operating Company with such narrative description and budgetary and other information as such Party (or its Affiliates) may have generated or gathered to the extent necessary to evaluate such Neutraceutical Opportunity. The Board shall consider the material presented by such Party and its Affiliates and shall elect whether the Joint Venture should pursue such Neutraceutical Opportunity. If the Board elects to pursue such Neutraceutical Opportunity, the Operating Company then shall have exclusive rights to exploit such Neutraceutical Opportunity, but solely with respect to use of Astaxanthin as a Neutraceutical, and, subject to Article 8.1, the Party (or its Affiliate) that has developed, discovered or acquired such opportunity, product or process will, however, be entitled to exploit such opportunity, product or process for application outside of use of Astaxanthin as a Neutraceutical. If however the Board does not elect to pursue such Neutraceutical Opportunity, the Party (or its Affiliate) that has developed, discovered or acquired such opportunity, product or process shall, subject to Article 8.1, be entitled to exploit such opportunity, product or process; provided, that subsequent developments or discoveries with respect to such Neutraceutical Opportunity would reasonably be expected to affect the Board's acceptance or rejection of such Neutraceutical Opportunity, such Party shall (or shall cause its Affiliate to) present such Neutraceutical Opportunity to the Board with reference to the pertinent subsequent developments or discoveries.\n\n8.3. If, after the date of this Agreement and continuing as long as a Party is a partner, member, or shareholder of the Operating Company, the Joint Venture develops or completes the development of, or discovers, or acquires proprietary rights over, a process or product which at, or after, the time of its development, discovery or acquisition has, or might have, some application outside of the Field of Agreement, then the appropriate entity of the Joint Venture shall offer to license the use of the process or product (or the production thereof) for such application to each of the Parties on reasonable commercial terms (including, without limitation, the possible payment of royalties at market rates) taking into account the time and money spent by the Joint Venture and taking into account other relevant commercial factors. The grant of licenses to any third parties shall be the prerogative of the Board provided that no such license shall be granted at terms more favorable to the third party than were offered to the member(s) of such Party.\n\n8.4. In the event either T&L or Igene wishes to market Astaxanthin for uses other than in the Field of Agreement, including but not limited to the use of Astaxanthin as a neutraceutical or otherwise for direct human consumption, either T&L or Igene, as the case may be, shall be permitted to purchase reasonable quantities of Astaxanthin from the Operating Company for use in the manufacture of such products at the Average Market Price. The Joint Venture will manufacture such Astaxanthin to the standard required for its business, and each Party desiring to market Astaxanthin for other uses shall process the product acquired from the Operating Company at its own cost and expense.\n\n9. MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL OF THE JOINT VENTURE.\n\n9.1. The Joint Venture will be managed and controlled by a board of directors comprised of six (6) members (the \"Board\"). Each Party shall appoint three (3) of such members (none of whom shall be residents of the United Kingdom) and shall be entitled to\n\n\n\n\n\nappoint any successor appointees as necessary such that the Board shall always be comprised of three members appointed by each Party. Each Party shall be entitled to appoint alternate directors on a periodic and temporary basis as needed. Each party agrees at all times to vote in favor of the directors appointed by the other Party or any successor appointees.\n\n9.2. The Board shall have a Chairman selected in odd-numbered years by Igene and in even-numbered years by T&L for the duration of the calendar year. The Party with the right to select the Chairman shall select the Chairman from among the members of the Board appointed by it. If for any reason the individual serving as the Chairman ceases to be a member of the Board, such individual shall also cease to serve as Chairman and the Party who appointed such individual to the Board may select another individual appointed by that Party to the Board to serve as Chairman through the remainder of such calendar year. The Chairman shall serve as the chairman of all meetings of the Board and shall serve in such other administrative capacities as may be appropriate or as the Board may determine from time to time, but the Chairman shall not have any additional vote or authority by virtue of being the Chairman.\n\n9.3. The Board shall have regular meetings at least once each calendar quarter which shall be called by the Chairman by written notice delivered to each Board member no later than five business days prior to the meeting specifying the date, time and place for such meeting. Either Party may at any time provide the Chairman with a written request that the Chairman convene a special meeting, whereupon the Chairman shall call a special meeting to be held within two weeks after receipt of such request by written notice delivered to each Board member no later than five business days prior to the meeting specifying the date, time and place for such meeting. Any member of the Board may attend a meeting by telephonic equipment if such member may hear and be heard by all present at that meeting (including others participating telephonically).\n\n9.4. The decisions of the Board shall be by majority vote of the members present at a meeting, provided that such majority vote includes the affirmative vote of at least one member appointed by each Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after either Party either has an Event of Bankruptcy or is and continues to be in material breach of this Agreement (unless such breach is being contested by the breaching party in good faith) and no director appointed by such Party attends a duly convened meeting of the Board (after notice delivered pursuant to Article 9.3), the affirmative vote of three members of the Board at a duly convened meeting of the Board shall constitute approval of the Board for all purposes hereunder, regardless of whether a member of the Board appointed by each Party approves such matter.\n\n9.5. The Board shall establish various authorizations and delegations for Management (as described below) to conduct the business of the Joint Venture as contemplated by Article 1.1 hereof.

The Support Services Agreements shall provide that the parties will provide the following services to the Joint Venture:\n\n11.1.1.Igene or its Affiliates will provide to the Joint Venture:\n\n(i) Sales and marketing services related to the world-wide sale and marketing of Astaxanthin in the Field of Agreement;\n\n(ii) Research services related to further development of the Technology and improvement of manufacturing process efficiencies, as requested by the Board from time-to-time; and\n\n\n\n\n\n(iii) Administration of the contract for manufacturing of Axtaxanthin with Fermic S.A. de Mexico pursuant to the terms of the Support Services Agreement.\n\n11.1.2.T&L or its Affiliates will provide to the Joint Venture:\n\n(i) Engineering and operations services;\n\n(ii) Technical and research services related to the further development of the Technology and improvement of manufacturing process efficiencies, as requested by the Board from time-to-time;\n\n(iii) Transportation and logistics services; and\n\n(iv) Finance and accounting services.\n\n11.1.3.The charge for the services set forth in Article 11.1.1 and 11.1.2 is set forth in the appropriate Support Services Agreement and shall be paid by the Operating Company.\n\n11.1.4.T&L or its Affiliates shall also provide certain utilities and waste treatment services to the Joint Venture from its existing facility located at the Site.

Such transition period shall not exceed 24 months for the services set forth in Article 11.1.1 and Article 11.1.2 and shall not exceed 36 months for the services set forth in Article 11.1.4; provided, however, if T&L shall give notice to Igene that it intends to close the Selby, England facility adjacent to the Site, T&L shall be required to provide the services set forth in Article 11.1.4 for a period not to exceed 24 months from the date Igene receives such notice.\n\n11.3. In the event of a contradiction between the terms of this Article 11 and any Support Services Agreement, the terms of the Support Services Agreement shall govern.\n\n12. RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL; TERMINATION OF THE JOINT VENTURE AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n12.1. RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL; TAG-ALONG RIGHTS.\n\nPrior to one year from the Effective Date, a Party may not sell or otherwise transfer its interest in the Operating Company. Thereafter, any sale or other transfer may not be effectuated except pursuant to a good faith, arms' length offer to sell its entire ownership interest in the Operating Company for cash consideration to a party who is not affiliated with such Party (a \"Third Party Offer\"). If either Party has received a Third Party Offer that it intends to accept (the \"Offer\"), such Party (the \"Selling Party\") shall notify the other Party (the \"Offeree\") of the Offer, which notice shall include a copy of the Offer and any other information necessary to enable the Offeree to evaluate reasonably the Offer and the potential purchaser. The Offeree shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice from the Selling Party (the \"Option Period\") to elect either (i) to purchase the Selling Party's interest in the Operating Company or (ii) to sell the Offeree's interest in the Operating Company to the Selling Party, in either case on the same terms and conditions as those contained in the Offer. If the Offeree makes one of such elections, the applicable purchase and sale shall take place within sixty (60) days after the date of the Offeree's election in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Offer or such other terms and conditions as the Selling Party and the Offeree shall mutually agree. If the Offeree does not make one of such elections within the Option Period, the Selling Party shall have the right to sell its interest to the person or entity who made the Third Party Offer for cash consideration only on terms and conditions no more favorable to such person or entity within sixty (60) days after the expiration of the Option Period. If such sale is not completed within such sixty (60) day period, the offer from the Selling Party shall be deemed to have been revoked and any subsequent offer from such Selling Party shall be subject to the right of first refusal described herein.\n\n12.2. TERMINATION OF THE JOINT VENTURE.\n\n(a) If there is an Event of Bankruptcy with respect to either Party, then the other Party may elect either to terminate the Joint\n\n\n\n\n\nVenture (and follow the liquidation procedures set forth in Article 22.3) or to purchase the interest of the Party who had an Event of Bankruptcy for a purchase price equal to the market value of such interest as determined pursuant to subsection (c). Such election shall occur within 60 days after the Event of Bankruptcy unless prohibited by a bankruptcy court or other court of competent jurisdiction; provided that once any such prohibition is no longer applicable, such election shall occur promptly thereafter. The other Party shall provide written notice to the Party who had an Event of Bankruptcy upon the election of the other Party, which notice shall specify the effective date of the action elected by the other Party.\n\n(b) If the Parties shall agree to terminate the Joint Venture pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Parties agree to terminate the Joint Venture and follow the liquidation procedures set forth in Article 22.3 unless the Parties otherwise agree.\n\n(c) Upon delivery by either Party of such Party's election to purchase the interest of the other Party upon the other Party having an Event of Bankruptcy, the Board shall meet for the purpose of retaining a mutually acceptable, qualified investment banking, accounting or appraisal firm of national reputation with no conflict of interest with respect to either Party or any Affiliate thereof (a \"Qualified Expert\") to determine the market value of the Operating Company. If the Board is unable to select by unanimous agreement a single Qualified Expert, then the appraisal shall be arrived at by mutual agreement of two Qualified Experts, one selected by each Party. If in such an instance either Party shall fail to appoint a Qualified Expert within fifteen (15) days after a written request to do so, such failure shall be deemed acceptance of the conclusions and appraisal of such Qualified Expert as has been appointed. If the Board unanimously selects a single Qualified Expert, the value of the Operating Company as determined by such Qualified Expert shall be final and binding upon both of the Parties. If two Qualified Experts are chosen, one by each Party, and such Qualified Experts either agree or the greater of the two valuations is no more than 110% of the lesser valuation, the average of the valuations of the Operating Company as determined by each such Qualified Expert shall be the value of the Operating Company for the purposes of this Article 12.2 and shall be final and binding upon both Parties. If two Qualified Experts are chosen, one by each Party, and such Qualified Experts cannot agree within thirty (30) days of the appointment of the second of such Qualified Expert (or their valuations differ by more than 10%), then (i) the two appointed Qualified Experts shall select a third Qualified Expert, (ii) if the determination of any of the three Qualified Experts is greater than the two smallest determinations or smaller than the two greatest determinations, in either case by more than 125% of the difference between such other determinations, such determination will be disregarded and the average of the two remaining determinations shall be final and binding upon both of the Parties and (iii) otherwise, the average of the three determinations of the three Qualified Experts shall be final and binding upon both of the Parties. The market value for the interest of the Party who has had an Event of Bankruptcy shall equal the market value of the Operating Company as determined above times the interest of such Party in the Operating Company as stated in Article 4.1.\n\n13. LIABILITIES.\n\n13.1. Igene (the \"Indemnifying Party\") shall indemnify and hold harmless T&L, its Affiliates, the Operating Company and the Manufacturing Company, and their respective officers, directors, shareholders and agents (collectively, the \"Indemnified Parties\") from and against any and all claims, demands, actions, lawsuits, proceedings, liabilities, losses, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and disbursements incurred by any of the Indemnified Parties in respect of any such claims, demands, actions, lawsuits or proceedings) arising from any actual or alleged infringement of any patent, trademark, trade name, trade dress, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary right (whether under the laws of any country or of the European Union) resulting from the ownership or use of the Technology by Igene or as contemplated herein, including without limitation a failure of the Operating Company to have unencumbered rights in the Technology as a result of the pending lawsuit (the \"Lawsuit\") styled Archer Daniels Midland Corporation v. Igene Biotechnology, Inc., United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Case No. S97-2358, or any similar claim.\n\n*\n\n* Intentionally deleted pursuant to a request for confidential treatment.\n\n14.

This Agreement, including the Appendices attached to this Agreement and the Recitals set forth herein, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and all prior representations, discussions and negotiations between the Parties and/or their representatives pertaining to the subject matter of this Agreement are superseded. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the terms and provisions of the certain Nondisclosure Agreement dated as of March 19, 2001 as amended August 5, 2002 between the Parties shall remain in effect.\n\nB. Each Party (the \"Recipient Party\") agrees to hold in confidence and not to disclose either directly or indirectly to any third party any technical, financial, commercial or other information (the \"Information\") as may be revealed or disclosed orally, in writing or otherwise to it by the other Party or by the Joint Venture (the \"Disclosing Party\") and shall refrain from using any such Information for any purpose whatsoever other than for the purpose(s) for which the Information was disclosed or unless previously approved in writing by the Disclosing Party; provided, however, that these obligations shall not apply to Information:\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) which at the time of disclosure to the Recipient Party was in the public domain,\n\n(ii) which after disclosure to the Recipient Party becomes part of the public domain through no fault of said Party,\n\n(iii) which at the time of disclosure to the Recipient Party was in its possession or was independently developed by the Recipient Party (and the Recipient Party can demonstrate such by written documents dated before the time of disclosure),\n\n(iv) which disclosure is obtained by the Recipient Party from a third party which has not, either directly or indirectly, received the Information from the Disclosing Party; or\n\n(v) which disclosure is required otherwise by law, unless compelled to disclose such documents or information by judicial or administrative process.\n\nSpecific Information shall not be deemed to be within the foregoing exceptions merely because such specific Information may be construed as being within broader, non- confidential information which is either in the public domain or in the possession of the Receiving Party at the time of the disclosure of such Information, nor shall a combination of features which form Information be deemed to be non-confidential merely because the individual features, without being combined, are non-confidential. In any such instance where disclosure appears to be compelled by law, the first Party will notify the other Party so that such Party may avail itself of such measures as may be available for protecting the confidentiality of such information; provided, however, that neither Party will be prohibited from using such documents and information in litigation against the other Party.\n\nC. The Parties shall cause the Operating Company and the Manufacturing Company to adhere to similar obligations of confidentiality as set forth above with respect to Information received by it from either Party.\n\nD.

From time to time, each Party shall have the right to have its own internal or external auditors review the books and records of the Joint Venture.\n\n21.8. SUPREMACY. Other than as set forth in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and any other document related to the subject matter of this Agreement, which may be entered into by the Parties or between a member of any Party and the Joint Venture, from time to time, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail in each case, unless the Parties otherwise expressly agree in writing.\n\n21.9. TAX MATTERS. Each Party shall prepare its tax reports and returns in a manner not inconsistent with the tax reports and returns of the Operating Company, except in the case of manifest error.\n\n21.10. GUARANTEE. Parent hereby guarantees the performance by T&L of all of its obligations hereunder.\n\n22. DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES; LIQUIDATION.\n\n22.1. At any time for so long as both T&L and Igene own an interest in the Operating Company, at the request of either Party in a written notice to the other Party's appointees to the Board, the Parties agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve expeditiously any controversies, claims or disputes between the Parties that may arise from time to time under this Agreement or otherwise relating to the Joint Venture (each a \"Board Dispute\"). If, after a Board Dispute is addressed and recorded in the minutes in two regular\n\n\n\n\n\nquarterly Board meetings without resolution of such Board Dispute, then any such matter not so resolved shall be referred (by written notice by either Party to the other Party's general counsel and the other Party's appointees to the Board) to the Party Heads, who shall have an initial meeting with respect to such matters within ten days of the date of such referral notice, and who shall thereafter negotiate in good faith with each other for an additional twenty day period following the date of such initial meeting in an attempt to resolve any open issues.\n\n22.2. If any Board Dispute is not resolved through the procedure set forth in Article 22.1 after expiration of all of the time specified therefor, either Party, in the thirty day period beginning upon the end of the twenty day period described in Article 22.1, may provide the other Party with a written notice (the \"Offer Notice\") stating that such Board Dispute is not resolved and setting forth a price (the \"Offer Price\") and a list of three acceptable closing dates not less than ninety days after the expiration of the twenty-one day period referred to in the next sentence; provided, that an Offer Notice may not be served earlier than (i) with respect to a Board Dispute arising pursuant to Article 9.5(a) (General Manager Appointment), 9.5(k) (Operating Plans) (except as provided in subclause (ii) below), eighteen months from the Commencement Date, (ii) a Board Dispute arising pursuant to Article 9.5(b) (Capital Expenditures) or 9.5(k) (Operating Plans) that involves a contemplated expenditure which can be financed solely by the Joint Venture from its internal resources and/or using funds provided on normal commercial terms by any other party without any contribution or guaranty from either Party, eighteen months from the Commencement Date and (iii) with respect to any other Board Dispute, fifty-four months from the Effective Date. Upon receipt of an Offer Notice, the other Party must elect prior to the expiration of twenty-one days either to (a) sell its interest in the Operating Company for the Offer Price or (b) purchase the interest of the Party providing the Offer Notice for the Offer Price, which election in either case may be in a written notice which also specifies which of the closing dates identified in the notice delivered to such Party is preferred by such Party. On the closing date specified in the response notice, the Parties shall consummate the transaction selected in the response notice unless both Parties expressly agree otherwise. The Party initiating the notice provided herein, shall be required to provide such Support Services as agreed in the appropriate Support Services Agreement described in Article 11.1 to the surviving entity at a price (that shall be reasonably consistent with the methodology used for determining prices prior to such conveyance) to be agreed upon by the Parties for a transition period to allow the Operating Company to continue to obtain such services. Such transition period shall not exceed 12 months for the services set forth in Article 11.1.1 and Article 11.1.2 and shall not exceed 24 months for the services set forth in Article 11.1.4. The Party whose interest in the Operating Company is purchased shall take all reasonable steps to cooperate in the transition with the other Party so that the Joint Venture will be able to continue as an independent and functioning business after termination of the Support Services. For all purposes under this Article 22.2, if each Party delivers an Offer Notice to the other Party, the Offer Notice that is received on the earliest date shall be effective. If each Party receives an Offer Notice from the other Party on the same date, then the Offer Notice containing the highest cash Offer Price shall be effective.\n\n22.3. In the event the Parties (a) agree to liquidate the Joint Venture, (b) are required to liquidate the Joint Venture pursuant to Article 12.2 or (c) do not send any notice under Article 22.2 in the period allowed therefor, either Party may, by notice to the Board of such circumstance (the \"Liquidation Notice\"), commence the following liquidation process. Upon the Board's receipt of a Liquidation Notice, the Board shall meet to determine how to proceed.
