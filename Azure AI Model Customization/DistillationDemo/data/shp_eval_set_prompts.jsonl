{"item": {"input": "CMV: There are many positives to organized religion, and from my point of view the online left fails to see the benefits of it. How\u2019s it going guys. I\u2019m writing this from a place of good faith, so I would hope you respond as such. I\u2019m not religious, but I\u2019m extremely sympathetic to many religious peoples and groups. I think they are a force for good in America, and in many parts of the world.   I have a few points, just a few.  A: Community Organizing and Involvement B: Charity and Donation C: Common Morality   A: This is my biggest point, and it basically boils down to the idea of a central community building or area which can be shared and used for the will of the people. This has numerous benefits to the people, because the face to face human interaction of people who may disagree over politics, law, and the world can help make the situation much more amicable and respectful. People become less separated from each other because there is always a time of the week where you come together, sing songs, talk about life, and unite around something that are all parts of your life. This space can also be used for things unrelated to the church, such as picnics and clubs.  B: Religious organization all across the world, and specifically in America are some of the biggest givers. They donate in large amounts, to lots of different causes and people groups, no matter the time or situation. These donation aren\u2019t always related to faith either, and can range from helping your local homeless shelter to giving aid to Syrian refugees. This has demonstrably helped many people all over the world, and religious organizations are vital to thousands of non profits all across the globe. This isn\u2019t much of a arguable point, since you\u2019d be hard pressed to find someone who hates charity.   C: This is probably the main point you may disagree with, but I think a common sense of moralities is important for a society to function. Obviously they would have to follow the laws, but having act better because of some eternal force combing us all together is , I think, a good thing.   Common arguments against this are absolutely the bad religion has done before and arguable does today. But I would say that an influx of members to the church would actually be good because they would bring new more modern ideas of love and kindness, less excluding of homophobia and transphobia. Thanks a bunch, and I would love to hear everyone ideas about this."}}

For the summer, I am working at a sleep over camp that hosts different events per week. This week is what is known as \u201cbridge camp\u201d which means it\u2019s for children with special needs. The primary affliction here is Down Syndrome, however there are also kids with autism, major OCD, cerebral palsy, and a handful of others. After watching these kids for a few days, it is incredibly obvious to see that they suffer. We\u2019ve had an incident where some silverware was dropped in the kitchen, and a child with a sensitivity to sound started to panic because of it. It took nearly half an hour for him to calm down, and he had to be separated from the other campers so he wouldn\u2019t worry anyone else. We also have a lake, and the children are allowed to swim in it (under intense supervision of course). All was going well until a girl felt something brush up against her leg, panicked, and started to push her helper camper under water in fear, trying to get out of the water. If a few other helpers didn\u2019t jump into action quickly, I\u2019m sure that helper would have drowned, due to the size of the special needs girl compared to her. While I agree all life is important, what right do people have to decide that someone needs to live their entire life this way? Fear and panic are absolutely no way to live a life, especially for someone that doesn\u2019t understand the world around them. I think that making the decision to force a child to live with something so damning is wrong, and it would be better to simply abort the fetus early, if the condition is known about.

Then you hear 5 whacks/hits and my baby starts screaming and what sounds like her jerking my daughter.

{"item": {"input": "CMV: There should be no legal difference between American Citizens convicted of a felony who have completed their sentences and American Citizens who have not been convicted of a felony. Our allies abroad may not be aware of this, but Americans surely are: American citizenry exists in Four legally codified castes - felons, immigrants, Territorial Americans and Full Americans.   The only two legal differences between a documented immigrant and a Fully Incorporated American are that 1). If an immigrant commits a felony in America, they can be stripped of their citizenship and deported. 2). Is eligibility to run for the Presidency, which is also not what I'm here to discuss. The first applies to this conversation, the second does not.   Territorial Citizens are fully American citizens on Incorporated soil, but their own communities are not places in which they are fully eligible for federal representation.   The biggest difference in rights however, is between Americans convicted of felonies and Americans who have not been. The definition of a felony is vague in America and many misdemeanors are felonies...based upon the whims of the judge and former records (Jim Crow policies) - but effectively, these crimes, however they are defined in ones state, locality, or federally will leave an American struggling to get a job, unable to vote, often for the rest of their lives, unable to own a firearm (not here to discuss whether our 2nd Amendment Liberties fit in our modern society so would prefer if we kept that discussion to a minimal) and depending on the judge/state, various other requirements, like regular monitoring during \"probation,\" which is effectively a game of catch and release.   My stance is that limiting the rights and opportunities of people with felonies after their sentence (including probation) has been completed is immoral, arguably, tyrannical, and a relic of our enslavement culture, so we should reenfranchise, return gun rights to, and cease deportations of former citizens and limiting jobs available to convicted felons unless credible basis for a persistent threat to our election systems, the safety of others, or other institutions can be established (affiliation with a terrorist or international criminal organization, election meddling, etc...)

But here goes: My dad is insane and I think me and my family may be in danger and we\u2019re not sure what our options are. So a brief rundown: the past 8 years my dad has had random spikes of psychotic behavior and it\u2019s gotten worse and worse over time. This year, and specifically the past few months, it has gotten worse exponentially. I\u2019m pretty sure he has an extreme case of paranoid schizophrenia and possibly other debilitations. There have been several times that police have come to our house because of calls related to his behavior, but without evidence for an obvious crime, there\u2019s never really been much success there. Especially since he seems to be able to flip off his craziness like a switch when police show up\u2014 then we end up looking like we made the whole thing up.   A little more background, his father fought in Vietnam and had exposure to Agent Orange (suspected, I don\u2019t know the specific details) and ended up becoming very violent and disconnected later in life. My father\u2019s oldest brother has also been diagnosed with schizophrenia and is currently in the state hospital for murdering their mother (my grandmother). My father\u2019s second oldest brother is currently in prison for attempted murder, which he had tried to convince my father to help him with. To put it bluntly: there is a family history of psychopathic tendencies and murder on my dad\u2019s side.  Lately, my father has been getting increasingly crazier. He says he sees spirits jumping in and out of animals and people, he calls it a gift from god. He\u2019s also been watching a lot of murder documentaries and has been making weird comments about murdering people. He told my mother that he needed to kill this guy he suspected of stalking my mother, or \u201cat least cut his legs off\u201d so he can\u2019t stalk her anymore. And then the other day he told my mother that the shows he\u2019s watching are making him want to attempt murder. Specifically, he said he\u2019s been wanting to \u201ctake a hammer and bash someone\u2019s head in\u201d.

{"item": {"input": "CMV: Dating and finding a relationship is easier for the average woman compared to the average man Now, this isn't a post to bash women or how dating is easy for women. It's about how when you compare the experience of the average woman compared to the average man, it's easier for the woman to find dates and a relationship.  Let's start with an example from my personal life. Last year some friend of mine broke up. So far the woman has gone on multiple dates with three different dudes one after the other. Essentially when she decides that she doesn't like one guy she just moves on to the next one in less than a week. While my male friend hasn't had a single date so far and that's not due to a lack of trying. Now even though at the end of the day they are both still single, the women at least go on dates which mean she has a higher chance to find someone compared to the man who hasn't been on a single date.  This brings me to my first point. The average woman has a lot more options compared to the average man. I remember reading a survey that said that on average women are asked about 12 times a year compared to asking less than 1 guy out. And when we introduce online dating it gets even worse. On average a woman has a match rate of 30% while a man has 0.013%. This means that statistically, women have a lot more opportunities to meet the one compared to a man. More options are better than fewer options.  My second point comes down to the average dating strategy. The average woman is a lot more passive than a man, in the man is still the one doing the asking out and trying to impress the woman. This means that women have the option to just passively exist and they just pick and choose from their options. In addition to that, they always have the option of becoming proactive and going after the guys they want if they don't like their options. Compared that to the average guy whose only option is to actively go out looking for women and initiating stuff, since if he just stayed and waited for women to approach he will remain single.  And finally, there is the problem that till about the age of 54 there are just more men than women."}}

The people that sign these student loans are legally adults, and should be held accountable for that. I get that they are facing societal pressures of people telling them to go to college, but as legal adults it is their responsibility to know what they are getting into. I would support increased education for high school students about loans and debt, but absolving an entire demographic segment from responsibility for their debt on the basis that \"they couldn't have known\" is frankly ridiculous and feels like a cop-out.; 18 year olds are legally able to join the military or buy a home. If we want to absolve 18 year olds of their student loan debt, we would need to have a much bigger conversation about whether 18 year olds can legally be considered adults at all.  &#x200B;  **2. Student loans should be dischargeable through bankruptcy**  Sounds good in theory, but this ignores a fundamental principle of how bankruptcy works. If a business declares bankruptcy or if you can't make payments on your house or car, the bank can seize the business's assets or your house or the car. But if you can't make student loan payments, the bank can't exactly seize your degree or education.  &#x200B;  **3. We should cancel student debt because it would spur economic activity**  I'm not sure whether more consumer spending is even what we need right now in the high-inflationary economic environment in the US, but in any case, the argument has been present in so many political debates in recent political history, where one side asks to be given more money/spending power with the assurance that this economic activity will translate to the rest of the population in some way (Trickle Down Economics anyone?). It has always sounded to me like pro-cancellation arguers are just asking to be given more spending power, while hiding behind an argument that it's actually for the public good. Furthermore, I feel that undermining the principle of how debt works in our society by outright cancelling such a large amount of it would have enormous economic consequences and this would would outweigh any potential economic benefit (i.e. the debt can only be cancelled if the US government agrees to assume all of it, which would be incredibly expensive, or if they just order it to be written off, in which case no lender would ever have faith in the future that they can lend money and be assured of getting it back; at the end of the day, someone has to pay). If the Fed or the government really wants to spur economic activity, they can do so through targeted economic policy like stimulus packages or interest rates that wouldn't be nearly as haphazard or dangerous.   &#x200B;  **4. People who have paid off their student loans that are critical of student debt cancellation for others are wrong**  I have seen this one a lot. People who have paid off their own loans are critical of student debt cancellation (IMO justifiably so),because they feel that they worked hard and sacrificed to pay off their loans and are now being penalized by missing out on a hypothetical debt cancellation bonus. The counter-argument often offered is that these people are being selfish and that this is the price of progress, and we can't just not take progressive action simply because some people may miss out. An example that I have actually seen put forward on Reddit is that: if we hypothetically invent a cure for cancer, we can't just not use the treatment on current cancer patients, even if people who have already died of cancer may have missed out on this new treatment; we have to strive to progress as a society and cannot cater to the \"bag-holders\" who may have missed the wagon. This doesn't make sense to me, and again seems incredibly self-interested. A more applicable analogy to the cancer example would be if tomorrow we cap annual tuition for college at $5k for all future generations and leave all current student debt holders as the proverbial bag-holders; doing this would immeasurably benefit future generations in a sustainable fashion and allow equitable access to education, but current student debt holders would be the ones stuck paying the \"price of progress\".   &#x200B;  My personal stance on this issue has always been that we should lower interest rates so that people can actually pay off the debt, and focus our valuable political capital on policy action that tries to regulate or lower college tuition costs and expand access to college through these lowered costs, rather than cancelling student debt, which to me feels like a Band-Aid post-factum solution that doesn't address the root cause. I would love to hear what everyone else thinks!"}}

{"item": {"input": "How to help a friend struggling to swim in the deep end of academia? Buckle up, this requires a lot of background. My friend Hanna is in her mid-thirties. We met in graduate engineering school, were TAs for the same class and became close friends over time. I am not and have never really been in academia - got my MS and peaced out to industry. I'm struggling to understand how to help her because of my lack of knowledge.  She seems to become unhappier the more she sticks around academia, but is determined to stay in academia. Her dad was a professor and she loves teaching - whenever she used to come back from office hours, her eyes would just light up with joy. She'd always get the best, most ridiculous ratings on our TA reviews by the students.  She took about 6 years to finish her engineering PhD at a top university. Her advisor seemed a bit strange (rambled a lot, was disorganized, took three years to even read her second paper). If that person was my boss, I would have moved jobs because it seemed stressful and there was a lot of agonizing over things maybe not in her control? She had a fair number of papers when she graduated (3 with 1 more in process). She never seemed super happy writing papers and did not bug her professor as much as I would have for not reading her 1 paper.  She got a post-doc at another very good university. 6 months in and she was unhappy again. Similar to her first professor, this advisor seemed to ramble a lot, work odd hours. At least she got another paper published? But she would call being very stressed or unhappy about how things were running so I suggested maybe this post-doc wasn't the right fit. There was no teaching associated with this role.  She got another post-doc, this time at a top university. She gave the other professor 5 months notice that she was leaving. She was promised the ability to work on the research she wanted to work on. The new professor seemed very nice and from what she described, seemed to have more structure than the last two.   Well, it's been almost a year, and she is still very unhappy. I visited recently - and it just happened that her lab was going out to lunch so I joined - and the professor (her advisor) seems more chill (but still very rambly) but very oddly unprofessional? The professor spent most of lunch talking more than everyone else, and complaining to the lab manager about a small part of his job.  Hanna did not get what she promised from her advisor - she has not gotten to work on any of the projects she wanted to. That said, I know Hanna. She dislikes writing grants and I think might let opportunities like that slide by (or she certainly doesn't search them out). I also know that she's not super forceful in trying to communicate what she wants to work on, and she hasn't made specific plans to get there. I wish I could she say she was happy going with the flow - but she is specifically unhappy jumping on every odd task the advisor asks her to do. And there's no teaching.  And she will not quit. She's told me she's not sleeping well, and while she sat at her at-home desk when I visited for 8 hours, at least 2.5 of those hours were spent surfing the web or looking at youtube. She has mentioned being depressed (we don't really talk about specifics) but I know she's in therapy once a week.  She took one of these figure-out-what-you-want career paths with my and other friends' encouragement, and I desperately hoped this was it, she'd figure out that academia is making her unhappy and decide to do something else (probably teach?). Instead, she decided working at a smaller university with less research and more teaching is what she wanted to do.  I really want to support her. I've put together lists of universities she can look at, have offered to help review her research and teaching statements, and have tried nudging her to come up with a timeline for completing materials. She hasn't done the timeline thing. She never does. She has done some informational interviews, which I think is good. I've tried to encourage her to do some of these outside of academia - she's done a few, but frustratingly just with previous lab mates.  She also doesn't network. In my industry, that's just about the most important thing you can do. She is very introverted, and covid definitely hasn't helped get her going to events and just meeting other people in academia. I've tried to push her to do this, but she doesn't budge.  I've been very critical of Hanna here, but she is brilliant (like was valedictorian of undergrad and got almost perfect 4.0 in grad school), very caring and thoughtful, and I think is an amazing teacher. She is not the most organized and for some reason will not put things on a calendar to go do. She does not like writing grants, is on the fence about papers, and enjoys talking to the people she is close to and that's about it. Judging from all of her advisors who I could not stomach working for, I don't think she's great at judging character.  She seems more unhappy now than she has in a while (probably about as unhappy as she was when she changed post-docs). She thinks she needs to stay in her current post-doc another year while she applies to positions at small universities. I'm really worried about her - I know a job you despise can make your life miserable and lead to depression. She may already be there. I want to help her.  -Should I push her to leave academia? -Should I continue to push her to get on top of the small university applications? -Does she really need to stay at this post-doc another year if she wants to pursue an faculty position? -Would it really be the end of her academic career if she took an industry job for the next year? -What should I be doing to support her? -What advice do you have for her that I should pass along?"}}

While I see in this an important step towards the acceptance of homosexuality, I also see it as a quite limiting view. In a sense, it equates sexual preference to a \u201ccondition\u201d that some people have  On the other hand, I feel that the idea of assuming that some people choose to be gay is almost universally condemned.

{"item": {"input": "Possibly overdosed on a MAOI. Having amphetamine-like effects 24/7 now + severe tachycardia&hypertension when eating chocolate - what should I do? **TL;DR:** A study said ethanolic Garlic Extract is a MAOI, I started eating 6-7 cloves of garlic daily for this effect (today is day 8). On days 3 and 5 I ate chocolate, and both times my heart rate shot up to ~130 BPM and blood pressure to ~150/85. Past few days, I've been feeling a 24/7 amphetamine-like drug high - focus, irritability, heart palpitations, high resting heart rate (85-90 BPM). Last time I ate Garlic was 24 hours ago, yet I still experience these symptoms. I fear that the MAOIs in garlic are irreversible - if so, could it possibly take 2-3 weeks for my symptoms to resolve (until new MAO enzymes are made)? What is the appropriate treatment until symptoms resolve? (Been taking Oxazepam after the chocolate-tachycardia, but can't take it daily because of withdrawal concerns).  ****  Age: 24  Sex: Male  I have been reading a study saying garlic has antidepressant effects in rats, and that it works by MAO inhibition, with comparable potency to the clinical MAOI Imipramine. Because of this, I proceeded to eat 6-7 cloves of raw garlic daily for 1 week, for the antidepressant effects.  I did feel stimulant-like, mild-antidepressant effects already on the first day, so I kept eating such amounts of garlic for a week. However, on Day 3, I had an incident where I ate chocolate, and got a mild version of \"hypertensive crisis\" - my heart rate shot up to 134 BPM, my blood pressure to 148/86 (my usual: 100/60). I immediately took 20mg oral Oxazepam and my vitals normalized. I didn't link it to the garlic, and so on Day 5, I ate chocolate and the same thing happened again, and Oxazepam helped me again.   Today I finally made the connection. The last time I ate garlic was 24 hours ago. Looking back, I realize that in the past few days, I've had pronounced amphetamine-like effects that lasted the entire day, every day, for at least 3-4 days. Focus, irritability, heart palpitations/\"flutters\", high resting heart rate - most of the effects. I took Adderall in the past, and I currently feel very similar to how the Adderall made me feel.  This makes me very concerned. My high resting heart rate (85-90 BPM) gives me a lot of discomfort, and the palpitations are worrying. Since I know many MAOIs can be irreversible, my biggest fear is that the MAOIs in garlic are also irreversible. In this case, does it mean it will take a few weeks for my symptoms to resolve? If so, what would be the treatment during those few weeks? I obviously cannot keep taking a benzodiazepine every time my heart rate spikes up, because then I'll develop withdrawals.  So, what should I do?"}}

I apologize for the length of this post but I am at my wits' end.  ___  I went to a very prestigious high school and, due to financial reasons, had to lower my gaze from the elite universities that most of my classmates ended up attending. I went to a pretty good public university on a full scholarship and did my best to never look back. I started as a CS major due to interest in high school. I got a research position in my second year (which I held for the rest of my undergraduate career), but found myself increasingly pulled towards mathematics and theoretical CS over the more application-oriented curriculum.   After some deliberation, I moved over to majoring in physics. (Actually, I felt I was so deep into the CS major that I might as well finish the degree, so I double majored.) For many reasons, I enjoyed the subject much more, but I was behind my classmates and my grades ended up \"suffering\" (A-s and some B+s, low in my eyes) for it. I caught up fast enough to have a good GPA in upper-level courses, but I did not have any room to explore graduate courses or electives due to my double major. I ended up finishing in ten semesters, which required taking multiple summer courses and a few semesters with course loads that made my advisors sigh. I had room for exactly only one elective (analysis) and one graduate physics course (QM).   I very often felt insecure about my non-extraordinary setting. I really want to say that the school doesn't matter, and that a committed student can be great anywhere, but the world has seemed to disagree with me on every single occasion. To try to keep a level ground, I periodically messaged friends studying physics at Ivies so that I could self-study material at a more sophisticated level. I have also worked through a general undergraduate math curriculum as I lean heavily towards mathematical physics. As of now I am still self-studying math, currently algebraic topology (Hatcher), next functional analysis (Conway).   My Physics GRE was something like 75%th percentile, which disappointed me greatly. I kept my head up and did not hold myself back when applying for PhDs. I did extensive research and applied only to schools I felt strongly towards, one of which was my undergraduate university. One of my advisors mentioned a very competitive scholarship for a full-ride to a English university, so I also applied for the Master's-equivalent there. That was my giant reach, and I was optimistic that my hard work would translate better through my essays than through my grades and raw data.   I was eating lunch with my friend when I saw the email that I wasn't chosen for the scholarship (after getting to the final round). I made a stupid excuse to him and went to the lab room where I put my head down and cried until I fell asleep. The truly awful part was a line in the email saying (paraphrased) \"Everyone who got to this stage is such a good candidate, this is probably the first time you've been turned down from something like this,\" after spending five years battling uphill so hard.   In the end my choice was between a PhD at my undergraduate institution, and admission the English school with no financial assistance. Because of COVID (and money, like always), I went with the PhD. I am in my first semester and the feelings of inadequacy get worse every week. I am still trying as hard as I can, but I feel like I am at an insurmountable disadvantage in my position and that a career in academia is completely doomed. Conversations like this recent one in r/math (which I frequent) constantly reinforce the idea that I am on a sinking ship. I love teaching and I love researching; a professorship is an absolute dream job for me. However, the ratio of applicants to job openings is not in my favor, and I am nowhere near the top of the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 pile. I really want to believe that school names don't matter, that your advisor doesn't make or break your career, etc., and that your own merit is almost all that shines through, but I have never ONCE seen evidence for this after reading hundreds and hundreds of stories.  ___   I need advice. I am giving up fast. Worse still, I can't think of any other places I'd like to be -- I don't want to code as a career, and I am too \"pure theory\" to lean into more hands-on industry positions."}}

Both my parents have doctorate degrees, my siblings all went to Oxbridge or American Ivy League schools. They are, for all their faults, very capable of proper reasoning. Yet on any political issue they show zero willingness to engage in reasoned debate.  This is a trend I've seen amongst other conservatives online and in person. Transgender athletes? \"Ban them. They have an advantage. Testosterone advantage. Biological males!\" Even though no data agrees with their position. Sabine Hossenfelder does a very good job at breaking down the topic but even with Thomas, who compared to the prior years winners was relatively average (and actually performed fairly average for a competitive swimmer in the event as a whole).  Healthcare? \"Privatise it!\" But why? It only sucks because the Tories have underfunded it. Privatisation has failed in America. It's a bad, expensive idea that will cost us more money than the NHS. \"But I don't want to pay for other people.\" Then leave society. That's the only way you accomplish that goal.  It truly feels like they only care about how politics affects them and their predetermined biases/feelings, even if it is an objectively bad idea.  Now, I do admit my bias. I don't think any conservative has ever provided a convincing reason for their policy positions, only an explanation for why they hold said position (this isn't the same thing.... saying \"I believe this because\" is not an argument for my belief, it does not attempt to explain why *others* should agree with me).

Often times I here people say they hate cats but I've never heard really any good reason to hate cats. The only one I can really understand is that they're allergic. But other than that, cats are pretty easy to maintain and take care of especially compared to dogs. Whenever someone says they hate cats they always use vague terms like, \"cats are evil\", or \"cats are just mean\". I think what people don't understand is that cats don't love unconditionally like dogs do. From my experience if you treat a cat with love and take care of it as you should cats can be the most love able creatures on the planet. With dogs however, you could literally be abusive to a dog as long as you feed it it'll still obey your command.  That's why I think majority of people say they hate cats. Because cats aren't going to blindly follow all your commands like a dog would so therefore they aren't as programmable as dogs if that makes sense. Each cat has its own unique personality and what it likes.  Cats also don't attack people like dogs do cats for the most part just mind their own business and don't require much attention. Cats are much more hygienic than dogs, cats don't bark all the time and disturb people, cats overall don't really bother anyone. So why do so many people claim they \"hate\" cats when cats have never done anything bad to them? I think it's just because hating on cats is the \"trendy\" and socially acceptable thing to do so many people just follow the trend."}}

Over the weekend it took 1 NYT columnist to remove Pepe le pew from polite society. This Cartoon Skunk has not been culturally important in what 10-15 years?  Yet he was canceled all the same.   The reason why conservatives hate cancel culture isnt because they necessarily disagree with whom is being canceled( i thought pepe was a goner years ago) but because only select individuals decide who is allowed to stay and who is allowed to go. lets take Future for example, one of the most popular rappers alive right now and certainly of 2015-2019.  one of his most popular songs is called \"mask off\" the lyrics in the chorus are \"Percocet, Molly Percocet\".   my problem with cancel culture is if we agree that Pepe is contributing to rape culture surely future is contributing to the opioid epidemic no? but the gatekeepers do not ever hold rappers  to the same degree that they do this cartoon skunk and if you ever try to bring it up they dismiss you.

{"item": {"input": "CMV: Ceaselessly Hate-Sharing the Posts of Our Political Enemies Does More Harm Than Good I'm from the US and personally lean pretty far to the left, so my Reddit feed includes several left-leaning subs, and some days it feels as though my feed is dominated by reposts of tweets from Ben Shapiro, Matt Walsh, Stephen Crowder, Charlie Kirk, Marjorie Taylor-Greene, Lauren Boebert, etc. I like to laugh and gape at the dumb things they say as much as anyone, but at a certain point it feels like the sheer amount of signal boosting we do of extremist and troll voices does more hard than good.  First, I want to acknowledge the one positive that occurs to me (there maybe be others) -   1) **It gives us a window into the opposition's thinking.** However stupid these beliefs may seem to me, they're held by millions. And while some of these people are just troolish pundits - Crowder, Kirk, Walsh, etc - others are actual members of the US's national governing body. So however much I might cringe at what they're saying, it might also be important for me to hear it so I know what I'm up against.  But I personally just feel that the downsides are stronger -   1) **It feeds the troll.** These people go out of their way to post the most incendiary possible version of their beliefs specifically to garner attention, both good and bad. They want to rile up their base, but also to rile us up. All press is good press if you're a scumbag, and they seem to take pleasure in our frustration/horror/mockery. And even if we're just reposting a tweet, inevitably that's going to lead more people to the original tweet.   2) **It makes us believe that everyone on their side agrees with them.** In the same way that delving into abortion statistics reveals that the conservative (and liberal) rank and file have far more nuanced views than their most extremist flank, I find that talking to just about any conservative is more complex (and genuine) then the gotcha jabs and distorted statistics and extremist takes that people like Greene and Shapiro post. Yes, plenty of people agree with these crazies, but plenty don't.   3) **It makes us dumber.** Some of our beliefs might really benefit from some scrutiny. Some of our positions might be opposed by real evidence or persuasive rhetoric that's worth hearing out. But we'll never believe that as long as we mostly share and engage with the stupidest voices on the opposing side. I don't believe in a false equivalence, or endless devil's advocates, or needing to defend every belief, but I do think we can end up more smug or arrogant than we deserve if we only engage with moronic trolls.  4) **It makes us defined by our opposition.** This one's a bit more nebulous, but we know we live in a time of record \"anti-partisanship,\" where more people than ever before vote to stop the opposition's agenda rather than to advance their own. This usually encourages a type of legislative paralysis where we end up celebrating the status quo, because the goal was \"beat them and stop negative change\" instead of \"enact positive change.\" I think we'd just be healthier if we spent more time upvoting those we support and trumpeting their words and deeds rather than trashing those we oppose.

{"item": {"input": "CMV: Parents who have no custody over their children should not be required to pay child support. So this comparison came up in another thread and I thought it was apt.   If a parent or parents decide they do not wish to keep their child they can relinquish it to the state and not be involved in its life.  The adoptive parents, assuming there are some, don't receive monthly child support checks from the biological parents.  We recognize that a biological parent who has no involvement in their spawn's life is not financially responsible for that child if they don't want to be.   This changes if only one parent wants responsibility but the other does not.  If Parent A says they have no interest in a child, but Parent B says they do, Parent A ends up paying Child Support to Parent B.  My argument is that for Parent A the decision is the same in both cases.  She or he is not involved in the child's life and has no custody.  The decision is the same on their part and therefore the result should be the same from that decision: they aren't financially liable.   The onus of raising a child should be on the parent(s) raising it, and not on the biological parent(s) who have no hand in raising the child.  _____  > *Hello, users of CMV!

{"item": {"input": "CMV: When discussing politicians and elections people put far too much importance on personality and \u201clikeability\u201d as opposed to policies, experience, and consistency, usually because they know little to nothing about what their candidates actually stand for. People are already beginning to talk about the 2020 elections and potential candidates, and once people I\u2019ve been seeing people talk a ton about how important it is for a candidate to have personality or to seem \u201clike the kind of guy I\u2019d have a beer with.\u201d Specifically, I\u2019ve seen a lot of this in discussion about Elizabeth Warren.

I think that the reason at least many people care so much about what a candidate is like is because they are uninformed about what their candidates stand for, and so they go based on gut feeling and personal impressions as opposed to actual items of importance. I understand that personality is important to an extant. It helps politicians win over other politicians, and is helpful for anything involving negotiation. But it shouldn\u2019t be prioritized above the actual policies, and the fact that likeability is seen as more important is a major reason why we have so many political issues in America. _____ > *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

{"item": {"input": "CMV: Glitter should be a regulated substance and artists should be required to have a license before being able to purchase glitter Let me preface this by saying that we look at glitter all wrong. Most of us look at it as just another piece of the artist's toolkit, but the fact is that glitter was weaponized long ago by people willing to send envelopes full of glitter to your enemies, or even by the infamous porch-pirate revenge video who used weaponized glitter not once, but twice.   Now, let's look at why glitter should not be available to the general public:  1) It's a pollutive nuisance - glitter can't be recycled, and using it on regular paper materials means those can't be recycled either. Glitter can make its way into waterways and from there via fish directly into the food chain. There are already record levels of microplastic contamination discovered in tap water.   2) It's a health hazard - glitter can irritate your skin, or make its way in to your eyes and even blind you. The British Medical Journal has urged doctors to look out for patients complaining of swollen eyes and vision loss after a 49-year-old woman was almost blinded after glitter rubbed off a Christmas card into her eye. It had formed into a clump, causing a lesion. According to Frank Kelly, a professor of environmental health at King\u2019s College London, \"[Glitter] could deliver chemicals to the lower parts of our lungs and maybe even into our bloodstream\".  3) It's dangerous to have around the house - the fact that glitter is sold to everyone willy-nilly means that parents buy it for their children, who are not the sturdiest of creatures at the best of times. Knock over glitter once, and your home is no longer hospitable. Vacuuming or sweeping can never collect all the glitter, and once you knock it over, it becomes an actual menace/hazard: babies and pets can ingest the glitter, it gets all over everything, and all members of the household will transport the glitter throughout the house, extending it's reach and range.  Glitter should be treated similar to any other chemical hazard which can cause drastic pollution, poison food chains, cause physical damage to multiple different systems of the body, and similar to some chemical agents and weapons, are extremely hard to purify an area once glitter begins to spread.  I'm not saying that we should ban all glitter, as recommends Dr. Trisia Farrelly, an environmentalist from New Zealand\u2019s Massey University (\"I think all glitter should be banned. Producers should not get away with making a profit out of the production of disposable, single-use plastics, while bearing little responsibility for the damage.\"). I can appreciate that it does have a place in the art world, but like other dangerous substances, glitter needs to be regulated and should not be available on the open market for whoever wants it."}}

Certainly we associate femininity with the female sex, but that's exactly the reason why it affects men as well.

I am a man but I've been an ardent femininist for my entire life, and it pains me to see ridiculous and often ill-informed opinions on one of society's most prevalent issues. Men seem to feel threatened by feminism, as if empowering women means to de-empower men. This is not true in the slightest!

I understand that there are radicalists in every movement out there, but fringe opinions do not affect my beliefs.  The men's rights movement (which I truly hope only exists on the internet) is unnecessary. Men have held positions of power for millennia - is it really necessary for us to feel better about being a man? Where feminism seeks to tear down the ideas of being male and female, men's rights activists (or should I say, soapbox preachers) seem to do nothing but boost male egos.

I'd like to prepare for this course as much as possible, especially considering I haven't taken a math class since AP Calculus!  I imagine some sort of Intro to Statistics text will be assigned, so I was hoping I could at least get a handle on the subject by reading a more layman-focused book.   Are there any pop-statisticians out there along the lines of, say, what Dan Ariely does for behavioral econ? (I happen to be reading *Predictably Irrational* at the moment.)  Thanks!"}}
{"item": {"input": "New York - Involved in a car accident. Cop and responsible party are friends. I was the only car stopped at a red light making a left-hand turn. The light turned green, and I had a green arrow. I started turning, the car directly across the intersection blew the red and t-boned me.    I saw him pick up his cell phone. He refused to get out of the car or acknowledge me. A few moments later, a police officer arrived. The other guy jumped out of his car, shook the officer's hand, and said, \"Thanks for coming, Dave.\"    The officer took his statement, and didn't say a word to me other than to ask me for my insurance card. He went back to his patrol car, walked over to me, and handed me a summons.    He said, \"You're receiving a citation for failure to yield. You can pick up the police report in 3-5 business days at the police station.\"    When I informed him that I had a green arrow and the other vehicle had, in fact, gone through a red light, he chuckled and said, \"The other driver is a Captain on our fire department. He's driven our engine safely through more intersections than you've ever seen. I don't want to hear it.\"    I replied, \"But I have...\"    He put his hand up in my face and said, \"You're not getting out of this by lying to me. You can attempt to contest your citation in court. I'll see you there.\"     I picked up the police report and it says that the opposing driver had a green light as he approached the intersection. As he entered the intersection, I drove into the intersection at a high rate of speed turning left without yielding, impeding the other driver's path and causing the collision. It says that when I questioned I did not dispute the other driver's account of the accident and was issued a summons.    What I was trying to tell the officer was that I have a dashcam that captured the entire accident. I rolled my windows down as soon as it happened so the audio is fairly clear. It shows us both stopped at the intersection, me entering the intersection with a green arrow, the other driver gunning it into the intersection (it doesn't capture the crash as it was from the side), me getting out and attempting to talk to the other driver, audio of the other driver calling the officer Dave, video of me giving the officer my insurance card, and then video of him handing me the summons and refusing to listen to my side.    The other driver has already filled a claim against my insurance. When they called and asked me what happened, I told them the truth and that I have the whole thing on video. They are not paying his claim pending an investigation.    I have court at the end of this month. Should I try to contact the officer ahead of time to see if we can amend the report? I don't want to put a target on my back, and I feel like that's exactly what I'd be doing if I go into court and embarrass the officer by demonstrating that he lied. I am not trying to be nice here, I just really don't want every cop and firefighter in town to hate me. Cops stick together, and I don't want to get pulled over every time I leave my home.    I have not yet filed with the others party's insurance and I have not provided them the video. Only I and my insurance have a copy (I have several in both digital and physical medium)."}}

I have my problems with advertisement in general, but this is its own issue. children are children, and they shouldn\u2019t be pandered to in order to trick them into wanting products.  I don\u2019t think an economic standpoint will change my view, because profit simply isn\u2019t enough for me to move my morals. there should be ways for networks to make money without advertisements. The problem is, with on demand and youtube it\u2019s hard to make a specific time frame, and a lot of profit on youtube comes from ad revenue. Either way, that doesn\u2019t make it right or good. There should be ways to make profit, but not at the price of children.  also, i know you can\u2019t filter advertisements by individual television sets, so this would be a ban on advertisements in a certain time frame on certain networks, like cartoon network or disney.

{"item": {"input": "CMV: Mask Mandates are necessary as people are kindof stupid, and there is no good argument against them For context, I live in Scotland, which does have mask mandates from the government, and recently traveled to England, which does not (I think they might have starting yesterday because of the decepticon varient or whatever, but they didn't when I travelled a month or so ago). In Scotland, 95% of people on public transport and in shops wear masks. In England, about 2% seem to. The point of bringing this up, is to make the point that if we want people to wear masks, we do basically need to tell them they have to, as most people are too stupid to do it without the government telling them to.   As for the mask mandates themselves, I have never heard a good argument against them. I often hear people say things like \"oh so should we have mask mandates for the flu then\", I don't see how this is a counter. I would be happy to wear a mask for a few months in winter when the flu is most prominent, and if there is a particularly bad flu strain, then telling people to wear masks seems justifiable even if only to reduce money spent in healthcare, not to mention that hospitals often get overwhelmed in winter.  Other arguments I hear are \"muh government telling us to do things bad\", to which the obvious response is seatbelts and not being allows to drunk drive, both of which are things that have small chances to negatively affect other people or you, which you can't do.   There are medical exceptions, which I do think should be allowed, although maybe with a slightly higher burden of proof than we have now. And I've heard good argument for why kids shouldn't wear them, although those argument are stuff like \"they need to be able to see each others faces to develop emotional intelligence\", not \"it's child abuse\" or some stupid shit like that. I think teenagers should have to wear them too though, this would only apply to young kids."}}

{"item": {"input": "Ice Cream Recipe Calls for Whole Milk + Heavy Cream. Can I use some ratio of Half/Half or Light Cream instead of Heavy? I've been getting into ice cream making. I have a set of recipes that I like, but they always call for heavy cream, which requires a drive to the store, limited selection of sizes, and doesn't get much use outside of said recipes in my home.  Conversely, my corner store 2 blocks from my house carries light cream, half/half and every other ingredient I would otherwise need for a basic recipe.  Can I safely substitute light cream or half/half (at different ratios) for the heavy cream, or is there some other chemistry involved that will affect the end result?  Example:  Depending on your sources,  * Heavy cream is ~36% fat. * Light cream is ~20% fat. * Half/half is ~12% fat. * Whole milk is ~3.5% fat.   Recipe calls for 2 cups whole milk, 1 cup heavy cream. If I am doing the math right, this is ~14% fat.      (1 * 0.36 + 2 * 0.035) / 3 ~= 0.14  If I mix light cream to get the same overall percentage, is it the same?      (x * 0.2 + (3-x) * 0.035) / 3= 0.14     (x * 0.2 + 3 * 0.035 - x * 0.035) = 0.43     x * (0.2 - 0.035) = 0.325     x ~= 1.97 ~= 2  Thus 2 cups light cream and one cup whole milk.  (I may have my math wrong. I am also a little confused why half/half seems to have less than half the fat of heavy cream.)"}}

I am Doctor Mark Horowitz MBBS PhD, and I am a psychiatric researcher in the National Health Service in England, an honorary researcher at University College London and training psychiatrist. My research has been concerned with how to safely stop psychiatric medications based on understanding their effects on the brain - and the technique I have developed, called hyperbolic tapering30032-X/fulltext), has been adopted as guidance for the public by the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the UK. This research came out of my own awful experience coming off antidepressants. I run a clinic in the public health service in London to help people safely stop psychiatric drugs for anxiety and depression and find that many people who could not stop their medication in the 'old-fashioned' ways are able to do so safely in my clinic, now supported by studies using similar techniques.  I am also a co-author of the recent umbrella review assessing the validity of the serotonin hypothesis ('chemical imbalance') in depression, published in Molecular Psychiatry. While many psychiatrists say this is old news, research suggests that over 80% of the public still believe in the chemical imbalance theory, and many companies and healthcare bodies still promote it on their websites.  In North America, I have co-founded a company called Outro Health, which brings this gradual, supported and hyperbolic approach to people in Canada and the US, so that people will have the support they need (and which I did not have!).

It can be a specific application or general, but common situation. For example you use it often for prototyping before production or it's the best material against a certain chemical. Off the top of my head the materials I can think of (in no particular order) are:  - Aluminum 6061: Common grade for use as structural parts, jigs, quick prototypes, molds, etc. Probably one of my most commonly used materials. - Aluminum 5052: Common grade for parts that need to be bent or formed, but balanced for structure. - Stainless 304: Common general purpose stainless steel. This grade can work harden, so there are similar grades that are better for machining. - Stainless 316: Higher corrosion resistant stainless for marine type applications. - High Speed Steel: Common low cost material for machining. - Carbide: Common high performance material for machining. - Polycarbonate: Common plastic used in many applications such as windows, IP/NEMA enclosures, product enclosures/casings, etc. Easily machined. - Delrin/acetal: Common high strength/low friction plastic that's easy to machine. - PVC: Common material for tubing of various applications. Can be flexible or rigid. - PTFE: Common low friction, high temperature resistant, chemical resistant plastic. - Polyimide: Plastic suited for extreme temperature/strength applications. Probably most commonly seen as that gold film/tape Kapton. Not cheap. - Acrylic/PMMA: Common optical plastic for lenses and optical fiber. - Silicone: Common high temperature rubber suitable for sealing and thermal padding.  - Buna-N: Common general purpose rubber for sealing. - Borosilicate glass: Common general purpose, thermally stable glass material for lab equipment where silica is not needed. - BK7 glass: Common optical glass typically used when fused silica isn't need. - Silica/quartz glass: Common superior optical and thermally stable material. Can take significant thermal shock. Material also has incredibly low thermal expansion coefficient."}}

My father is, and has been, very sick for about a year. He was diagnosed with two different forms of aggressive, untreatable lymphomas. He has nerve death in his feet from years of alcohol abuse (been clean for about 8 years, though!). He had to have his spleen removed earlier this year, and he has several other health issues that I'm not particularly familiar with because I'm not a doctor and don't understand the terminology, most of which are related to his cancers.  For the year+ since his first cancer diagnosis, he's been pretty elevated about the whole deal. He's made it very clear to my siblings, my stepmother, and I that he does \\*not\\* want a long, drawn-out old person death. He already has a DNR/DNI order on his chart, and has repeatedly said to all of us that he's happy with the way his life shook out and he's ready to leave the world. This was when he knew he was terminally ill, but was still relatively healthy and mobile.  Well, last week he had a major health crisis. Because I'm not a doctor I don't really understand the details, but the MAST cells in his system caused an enormous anaphylactic reaction that caused his blood pressure to drop. He also had an infection in his lungs that needed to be treated with an aggressive course of antibiotics. Worst, though, was that something about this incident triggered four different strokes. Three were relatively minor, but the fourth was a medium-to-large-sized event.  My sister, stepmother, and I have been taking shifts with him in the hospital since the event. He's having trouble finding words, but is still capable of expressing himself for the most part. Through all the physical therapy, medications, and hours of sitting in a hospital room, he has made it absolutely clear that the lifesaving interventions we put him through after the stroke were way too much and he would rather die than go through any of it again. He has begged us to change his physician's order for life saving treatment (POLST) form to specify that he should not receive treatment for similar events in the future.  The thing that's driving me nuts about this situation is that our stepmother (who has durable power of attorney) is having a very easy time dismissing these statements as \"oh he's just depressed\" and has been dragging her feet on changing the POLST form and other preparations to fulfill his wish of getting the fuck out of the hospital, back to his retirement home, and getting a chance to say bye to his family and friends before going through the lengthy process of a physician assisted suicide. My sister (who's in medical school) believes that he won't get to the point of a PAS, and believes he'll go next time he has a similar event like the one he had. The big issue I'm concerned about is whether this event happens before the POLST form is changed. If that happens, and he's saved again to come back in an even more disabled state, my father is going to die hating us, and I can't live with that.  Things REALLY came to a head yesterday at the hospital. I'd never seen my dad cry before in my life. I'd also never seen him get so angry. Before my stepmother got there, he begged me to bring him a gun so he has a way out in case things got even worse. Even with his speech impaired from the stroke, he told my stepmother and me in no uncertain terms that he hated us for being so selfish and cruel by keeping him around.  I doubt my father would put a bullet in his head if he had a gun. I think he just wants one so he knows that if things get too unbearable, he knows he can end it all in a split second, rather than having to hold on and wait for another stroke, or heart attack, or infection to end everything, or waiting for the gears of the state to slowly turn to the point where he can have his PAS. But I believe that everyone on earth should have the agency to decide when, where, and how they die, and he is and clearly has been suffering horribly for the last week and a half.  If I were to roll to the gun store and get him a firearm, and he shot himself with it, what would be the legal ramifications for me? I'm okay with my family hating me and even being vindictive. I'm a financially independent adult, so I'm not concerned about any sort of aid being cut off. But if there's a chance of me being prosecuted for this act, I won't do it.  Thanks for reading."}}

I will often play the devils advocate, and if I'm talking to someone who is (for example) pro-choice, then I'll take the pro-life perspective, and viceversa.  Because I do this so often, I encounter some people who will respond with anger/disappointment that I am even entertaining the views of the \"opposite side\". These discussions are usually the shortest ones and I find that I have to start treading more and more carefully up to the point that the other person doesn't want to discuss things any further.   My assessment of this is that the person's refusal to engage is because they don't know how to respond to some of the counter-points/arguments and so they choose to ignore it, or attack the person rather than the argument. Also, since they have a tendancy to get angry/agitated, they never end up hearing the opposing arguments and, therefore, never really have a chance to properly understand where there might be flaws in their own ideas (i.e., they are in a bubble).   The result is that they just end up dogmatically holding an idea in their mind. Whatsmore, they will justify becoming angry or ignoring others by saying that those \"other ideas\" are so obvisouly wrong that the person must be stupid/racist/ignorant etc. and thus not worth engaging with. This seems to be a self-serving tactic which strengthens the idea bubble even more."}}

Throughout 2016's election, I saw a crazy number of articles from left-leaning sources about how liberals needed to \"reach across the aisle\" and attempt to truly understand why someone might vote for Donald Trump. We were asked to conceptualize their struggles and empathize with their suffering, to acknowledge their humanity and their pain.  Vox beseeched liberals to listen to Trump voters' concerns. The Atlantic profiled Trump supporter after Trump supporter to dispel the conventional wisdom that they were all racist boomers or antisocial white nationalists. USA today did the same. 538 did repeated statical analysis to disprove those stereotypes. The New York Times told us to \"stop shaming Trump voters\". The Washington Post suggested we empathize with Trump voters. Hell, even the quite literally Socialist magazine Jacobin made the same request.  Meanwhile, reviews of books about rural white working class society became vehicles for left-leaning publications to ask readers to feel pity for the underserviced social sectors that became Trump voters. \"Hillbilly Elegy\" and \"Strangers In Their Own Land\", for example.  My question, then is this: Why isn't the Right held to the same standard?   Where is the Fox News op-ed about how Trump voters need to work to understand the root cause of BLM? When hasn't the Wall Street Journal ever profiled an Antifa member or a climate activist or even just a bunch of Biden voters in general? When can we expect the Washington Times to do a multipart series on how the struggles of indebted students, DREAMers and the LGBT community led them to vote Democrat? What books have even been written about how the Right specifically has a moral imperative to empathize with the Left?  Now, I know there is ugliness on both sides. I have seen a rash of 2020 articles on how the Left can stop caring about Trump supporters, because they're all racist, homophobic idiots who worship QAnon in between sodomizing themselves with assault weapons.

One side saying bad shit about the other does not (in my mind) invalidate my point.

Questions regarding strength, weight, and cost for cars Howdy -   I was thinking about future fuel regulations today and thinking about how the industry will meet them.  To me it seems there are two ways to make today's style cars meet those regulations - through more efficient engines and hybrid drivetrains and by channeling Colin Chapman who said \"simplify and add lightness.\"    The IC engine has become dramatically more efficient in the past 20 years through better computers, direct injection, variable valve timing, new materials, better FI, etc., so it seems that gains there are going to be incremental.  Hybrid drive trains are certainly a big possibility, especially if a consumer friendly KERS system is developed or battery tech takes off.  Other advances such as electric power steering and low RR tires that actually hold the road can also help with efficiency.  **I'd like to focus this question on \"adding lightness.\"**  I am a Lotus fan and that company, more than anyone, has traditionally focused on lightweight vehicles, most recently though the use of luminum \"tubs\" and chassis.  A nice video is here: Lotus aluminum bonding  In fact, Lotus Engineering has pioneered and licensed a lot of the tech involved (link).    In terms of \"tubs\" and chassis components, aluminum is much lighter than steel, but also costs significantly more and is not very \"repairable,\" making seemingly minor wrecks a total loss.  Carbon fiber is certainly lighter, but costs much more and cannot be manufactured quickly.  Can anyone offer anymore on this topic?  In terms of body panels, it used to be that fiberglass was lighter than steel - is that still true?  How much weight is saved by the use of carbon fiber?  Is aluminum still lighter than steel?  Where does plastic fit into all of this?  Are there any other options for lightweight body panels?  Please feel free to discuss any other weight saving or efficiency increasing options on the horizon.  Thanks in advance."}}

{"item": {"input": "CMV: \"Cancel culture\" and changing cartoon characters is mostly a way for white people to virtue signal/be \"saviors\" 1) The FSU Seminoles and the Chicago Blackhawks have *specific permission* from those tribes to use those names - yet they constantly get badgered by people not even in those tribes to change the name and that it's racist. I am referring to those two teams specifically, because they have that permission from tribal council - if those tribes allow it, who are we to tell them to change it?  2) I understand that it is extremely hard for POC voice actors to break into the profession. However, that needs to be reminded by new character being created & cast, not white voice actors being pushed out a job they've held for years to not get \"cancelled.\" The majority of people who were calling for the man who voiced Cleveland to step down were white. I also understand that  On that note, I believe that we need to defer to POC/minorities when a certain character is in question - Speedy Gonzales is a good example. White people pushed for his removal while Mexicans and Mexican-Americans protested for him to stay! It's not for us, people who are not in that community, to decide whether a character is good or bad. The creator of Ghost in the Shell LOVED the casting of Scarlett Johansson - which was accurate anyway because the robot that the main character resides in is outwardly European - casting an Asian woman would've been inaccurate to the story. But who complained? White Americans!  3) Dragging videos/tweets/etc made years or even a decade plus ago by famous people or influencers does nothing and implies that society as a whole refuses to forgive such transgressions and that there's no reason to try and strive to be better because it won't be believed anyway - especially when they've already apologized for it and there's no other instances of such behavior recently. Jenna marbles got bullied off of YouTube for videos she made almost a DECADE ago and had already apologized for, and there were no other questionable videos since then. What, then, is the point of dredging it up years later?  I feel the same with issues involving cultural appropriation - I constantly see white people putting down other white people for *appreciating* a culture I stead of appropriating it, when POC aren't even complaining about that specific issue - did the Polynesian people care that little white girls wanted to be Moana for Halloween, or did WHITE PEOPLE care so they could look enlightened?  In conclusion, I understand that, as we have privilege, we need to use our voices to help POC and minorities. But I believe there are two main issues:  - We end up talking OVER them and trying to tell them what they should be offended by, which implies they're not intelligent enough to decide by themselves/is incredibly infantilizing.  - We pull years old tweets and attack influencers and celebrities while refusing to believe that they have changed in the years since and also see that behavior as problematic now in an attempt to virtue signal and act like a good person.  I just really don't think that this is the way to legitimately help POC - obviously if they also agree there is an issue that's not the case, but I also think that problematic behavior from the past should be forgiven if that person has worked to become better - but we refuse to believe that it's not a publicity stunt when they do."}}

The problem with  monarchical government is that it espouses the same evil doctrine that  is at the root of all prejudice, bigotry, racism, and classism: the idea  that by mere accident of birth, one member of a political community is  of greater status than another.  The argument that a ceremonial, as opposed to political, leader is valuable to a country is a good one.  So, for example, in the U.S. the merger of the ceremonial head-of-state role and day-to-day leadership in one man, the President, is problematic.  The U.K. avoided this problem by having a ceremonial head-of-state separate from the politician, the Prime Minister, who managed the government day-to-day and week-to-week.

You lived a relatively comfortable life with the added reassurance that, were something to change, you wouldn\u2019t be on your own.  **Thus, my view is that on top of being selfish, they are not the smartest either as, all other things being equal, having the safety net of social welfare and not needing it is the best/most logical option.**  Ideally, I would like my view changed on both aspects, but proving that they are either not selfish or smart is also ok.  Arguments that I heard before/won\u2019t change my mind:  *People are responsible for their own lives/they should have prepared/they should have been more responsible/etc*. I\u2019m not talking about rich people who can fall back on their money/their family\u2019s money. In reality, most average people are one tragedy away from homelessness/poverty/hardship. I wish I could find that reddit post where the guy was explaining how it took 5 months after his wife\u2019s cancer diagnosis to lose 20 years' worth of savings and to have to remortgage their home. Basically, you can do everything right and still find yourself in a difficult position.  *There is/could be an option E in which such systems/programs are not needed to begin with.* I don\u2019t think that\u2019s plausible.  *Option B is preferable over D for said people because the possibility of their own misfortune bothers them less than the idea of someone else benefiting from their taxes.* This just proves that they are selfish and dumb for thinking that it\u2019s a good idea to sink the ship they are on just so the captain drowns.  *Option B is the best for them because they are not worried/they don\u2019t think it possible that they could be in the shoes of the less fortunate.* That just shows a total lack of empathy and awareness, assuming that just because they don\u2019t need it now, they\u2019ll never need it in the future proves they are not smart.  I also would prefer it, if your argument wouldn\u2019t be over semantics. English is not my first language so do let me know if something is unclear."}}
{"item": {"input": "How to thank your Vet? Our 2y M Goldador Gus decided to dry his insides with a towel, and we have had an extremely stressful week. A 2am visit to the emergency Vet, and they suggested pancreatitis. I wasn't convinced and requested an anti-emetic and sub-cut pain relief to last the 5 hours until my Vet opened.   Imaging confirmed a bowel obstruction and surgery ensued, with 1 length of towel from his stomach, through the length of his colon and well into his bowel. During this time he regurgitated and aspirated. He was hung off the table and the Vet was very concerned.   https://imgur.com/a/WrrgHWe  He was on the mend at home until yesterday morning when he was showing signs of infection. He had actually been seen by a Vet the previous afternoon and everything was progressing well. I work in the medical field, and got him to the Vet, fearing sepsis.   The staff at the vet have been incredible. They closed in the afternoon, with a vet and nurse staying with him until the vet went home after 9pm, the nurse did a 14 hour shift and swapped with another vet at midnight. The same nurse was back at 4am to swap again. This is not a 24 hour clinic.   They let my wife and I hang around with our dog, and we got him walking and urinating. All three of us were comforted by being allowed to be there.   While hanging around, I chatted with the Vet about my admiration for their role. They had experienced a very difficult day, with a routine surgery resulting in the loss of a dog. I understand resuscitation of this animal went for a number of hours and was unexpected by all. The vet was very upset by it.   My field of work has a long and dark history of suicide and mental health conditions, but we have coping mechanisms - both formal and informal. We also enjoy very defined relationships with our patients with the relationship starting and ending over the course of 1 - 2 hours. The impact of our role is still too much for many people.   I cannot fathom how hard vets and vet staff have it.   Clinics are either small with a limited number of practitioners, with long and drawn out relationships with patients who can't talk and owners who can't seem to listen. It's not like there is a bar that vets get to hang out in and debrief. They go home and think about their ongoing cases and get up in the middle of the night to continue working on them. It must be lonely and it must be consuming.   I understand the risks with my boy, and that's why I was so quick to get him back to care when his situation changed. My dogs are my world, and a big part of my coping mechanisms for dealing with my work related stressors. It doesn't matter if it is 3pm or 3am when I walk through the door... I always get greeted with love. When I am in a dark place, I have 2 labs ready to retrieve me. I can't express what loosing one unexpectedly would do to me.

{"item": {"input": "New landlord hates privacy. Help I recently found myself needing a month to month lease for between six months to 14 months in Baltimore, which I was unfamiliar with.  The apartment I found is a small efficiency in an older building.  They agreed to a standard lease for the first six months, followed by month to month lease.  I was to be the first tenant, when I toured it six weeks ago, workers were painting the rooms.  The landlords son is living upstairs, and this is my landlords first time renting.  The lease was obviously pulled from a form and seemed standard.  There is a clause in the lease which states that I can't install curtains rods or hooks.  This seemed standard as well, I had similar at my old apartment.  I assumed there would be some sort of curtain provided, and this was in regards to additional curtains.  I moved in Sunday, and found the landlord had not installed curtains at all.  At this point, I assumed the issue with curtains was the potential to damage to the wall.  So, I bought tension rods that require no hardware and used them to hang curtains.  Monday afternoon I got a text from my landlord saying I needed to remove the curtains.  The building is on a street corner with a fair amount of foot traffic.  Between the four windows, you can see all of my apartment with the exception of the portion of the bathroom with the toilet and tub.  Not only does this mean I have no privacy, but the neighborhood is slightly sketchy after dark.  The nearby buildings have bars on their windows.  Anyone passing by not only can see my possessions, but whether or not I am home.  I expressed this to the landlord in my reply over text.  He replied to reread my lease.  I left them up overnight.  I had orientation this morning and came back to find the curtains removed and no where in the apartment.  I discovered this before entering the building, as two guys were outside one of my windows and looking in my apartment.  They left when I entered the building.  I messaged the landlord saying he didn't have the right to enter the apartment and asked for the curtains back.  He again said to check my lease and then commented that I needed to finish unpacking as it looked messy in my apartment.  I had to head to a work event so I couldn't follow through more, but I moved my electronics to one corner and used a bookshelf to block one of the windows so they weren't visible.  While at the event, I got a text from the landlord with a picture of the blocked window, captioned \"whatts this\"  What can I do to prevent my landlord from entering the apartment unannounced and to compel him to allow some form of curtain?  Alternatively, how do I break my lease three days into it?  This is too crazy for week one."}}

{"item": {"input": "CMV: The recent move by Dems to gerrymander blue states to a similar degree as their opposition is a net negative change for America To preface I am not a Dem but I have never voted for a Republican. I hate both parties but I hate one party significantly more. Here are my primary concerns. There are *individuals* in both parties that I agree with on certain policies (again, nearly all Dems and Independents) but that's about it.  1. Gerrymandering is bad for numerous reasons including unfairness and being anti-democratic. 2. This move entrenches the tactic in state and federal politics. Whereas previously at least Dems had motivation to eliminate partisan gerrymandering via legislation since they are now approximately equal beneficiaries (or will be if they keep it up) they will likely stop fighting to eliminate it. 3. This policy allows non-Dems to declare \u201cboth sides\u201d with validity on this issue (whereas previously it was not a valid argument as it was clear the GOP gerrymandered worse/more). 4. Overall, this represents a stalemate at state levels where now we have a set of deep red or deep blue states which will essentially be locked into their political affiliations permanently. This will increase corruption in those states as there will be no political recourse (the voters no longer matter).  I'm mostly open to changing my view on this in the direction of \"this isn't that bad\" because I feel like this is one of the final nails in the plurality voting democratic republic coffin.

{"item": {"input": "What are my options if my advisor prevents me from graduating? Seeking advice in r/GradSchool as well, but hoping to get insight here from some faculty members.  I'm a thesis track Master's student currently in my 3rd year (6th semester). I was supposed to graduate last semester but delayed to this semester to give me more time to process data and perform analyses. My progress has been significantly slowed by unforeseen analytical issues, but mostly my advisor has been incredibly distant. I'm not looking for validation on that front - I've already had multiple discussions with my department's administration (including the chair) about my experiences, and they've all been appalled at how I've been treated. For the rest of the post, please keep that in mind.  I have 90% of my first chapter written, but my advisor is now floating the idea of me graduating in the summer or fall instead of this spring. They are concerned they may not have enough time to review my drafts before I defend in mid-April. They do not have any more funding for me, so they'd force me to pay my university's fees to stay a student while I finish up. However, I already have a job lined up that does not care about my degree, and I care way more about the work I'm doing with them than I care about my Master's. If I do not graduate this semester, that job immediately takes priority for me. I already plan on being very open about how my priorities will shift.  So, what are my options if my advisor wants to delay my defense?  1. I could go along with the delay and put the bare minimum into finishing up. This would cost me roughly $1,000 per semester. I am not a fan of this option. 2. I could attempt to force them to let me defend and graduate by threatening to quit altogether. I am my PI's first student, and two other students have already quit on top of misuse of university funds. If I leave, my PI will likely have to wait another 2.5 years for a student to graduate and produce any papers. That's 6 years of being a tenure-track professor with no students graduated or publications or presentations from their work. My advisor is incredibly vulnerable. 3. I could switch advisors and go with a non-thesis track degree. This would likely forfeit any publications with my current advisor or our collaborators. My entire thesis is based on a collaboration with a government agency, and our partner at that agency is on my committee. That committee member has been incredibly supportive and understanding, but I doubt I could publish with just them with our data. This option would also still result in a major delay in my graduation. 4. I could quit altogether.  I am incredibly frustrated at the moment and thinking somewhat irrationally, but I feel like I am being abused. For my own mental health, I need to be done as soon as possible, and I am very close to prioritizing my own wellbeing over a piece of paper. Any insight would be much appreciated."}}

I suspect this is because culture can be closely related to race.  However, many realities in the US are clearly influenced by culture. The most obvious example being the wealth disparities among different groups of people. Non-white populations all have significantly lower median household incomes. Of course racism and colonialism are relevant factors, but nigerians and asians face identical obstacles yet earn *significantly more* than white people do. Does anyone really believe it's simply a coincidence that one group's culture emphasizes education to an extreme degree while the other's glorifies sports, music, etc? I feel the reality is obvious. I know nigerian/asian immigrants who came to the US with literally nothing and within two generations their family holds tremendous wealth. Their children weren't focusing on being athletes or rappers, they instead they worked to become doctors.   Of course I acknowledge systemic inequalities exist. The US is now famous for that.

Anything that has been defined does not see court and has an automatic outcome.

This should overall make it clearer for what is and isnt legal, and keep the court system only for the corner cases - and eventually completely autonomous.  It would also remove the bias or corruption from individual judges or high profile criminals. Similarly the police force would be clear on what laws they can and can't enforce and why - removing police power trips or at least significantly reducing them, as they can be held accountable.

I played for hours and hours.  Anyway, fast forward 20 years. PC gaming is pretty great, I love it and always will. But mobile gaming? Unbelievably bad.  Processing power has leaped forward thousands upon thousands of times since the 90s. Our mobile phones and tablets are lightyears faster than the **fastest** 90s PCs.

Instead, they are just all horribly designed and executed - and that's even just ignoring the major issue already mentioned; all of the ads and paywalls. The ads and paywalls might be acceptable *if* the games didn't suck in the first place.  The only thing that has arguably improved in mobile games is graphics (duh).

{"item": {"input": "CMV: piercing your baby's ears before they even learn to talk is a weird practice and it's iffy it's even legal I know this isn't a pressing issue or anything, but I can't help but low-key judge parents who insist on getting, what for all intents and purposes is a body mod, for their infant daughters. Daughters who sometimes are barely old enough to hold their own head up.  Piercings are painful. They might ache for a few days after the fact. Babies aren't particularly good at being clean, so there's a significant chance of infection, especially if the piercing site bothers the baby.  I'm not even mentioning the fact that these babies are nowhere near old enough to consent to a body mod. A small hole in their lobe is no big deal, yeah, but it's still their body. They should be able to make that decision for themselves. I think waiting even a couple of years is worth it.  Why I want my view changed: I just want to know what goes through a parents mind when they decide to risk their baby's health at such a young age all to conform to.. a weird gender norm? Because we don't put earrings on infant boys. In fact, some parents ban piercings for their sons even when they're older and request them."}}
{"item": {"input": "What type of silicone would be best for a masturbation cup? Porous vs Softness Hi, kinda of odd but I want to independently create a fleshlight type sex toy. I have a ton of questions, and those \u201cask an expert\u201d websites seem to be dead so here I am.   TLDR;;; looking to create or find a non porous, non toxic soft material for a fleshlight. I don\u2019t understand what makes up \u202asilicone and how to learn more.    OK so from the information I\u2019ve read, the less porous the material is the softer it is, but non porous means it can be cleaned properly/no bacteria growth.\u202c So obviously I\u2019m looking for a material that is low on the shore a hardness scale but is still non porous. Phthalate is apparently bad because that is the cause of chemical burns with sex toys, but this is what would make the silicone soft?   I don\u2019t know which compounds that make up silicone that influence porosity, softness, heat retention and elasticity, durability etc etc. How does the curing method effect the silicone? I don\u2019t understand what it is I need to create a silicone soft enough for a masturbator cup. Is \u201cmedical grade\u201d and \u201cfood grade\u201d silicones just that because the structure of them is less porous? Could the same type of silicone that breast implants use work - and how would I even know how to convey the exact type of silicone formula I want to a factory? I assume the harder silicon that holds the liquid of a breast implant could be used as a coat layer in a masturbation cup, over a softer silicone material that would be toxic with direct contact. What\u2019s the formula of breast implants silicone? How would I learn if it would would be durable enough to hold, and not deteriorate when constantly rubbed? How would a know how durable a type of rubber would be if thinly spread?  But then I see there\u2019s other options like TPE/TPR. It has a low durometer, and the lower the durometer the softer the material...how is this different from the shore scale? I read \u201cTPE is generally considered body safe\u201d - generally, so not always? How can I learn what kinds of silicone are \u201cmedical grade\u201d or are platinum cured and how do they differ? How would I be able to communicate this to a factory and check if it\u2019s \u201cgood quality\u201d?  I have a lot of questions and idk how to find answers to any of this, Google isn\u2019t exactly giving me answers that are referenced from real sources so I\u2019m just ?????

{"item": {"input": "My dog suddenly during a routine procedure. Today my dog died.  &#x200B;  She was a 13(or so) old Pekingese. I took her in for her second round of vaccinations and to discuss potential dental cleaning as her breath was horrid.  &#x200B;  Backstory:  &#x200B;  I adopted her nearly 5 years ago. A dental expert estimated her age at about 5-7. She had horrid teeth. He removed 18 during a 2 hr surgery in Spring 2014. Even though I tried to brush them as best I could (she hated it) little by little tartar returned. In Nov 2016 she needed an emergency surgery for a bladder obstruction. Her bloodwork showed less than ideal liver numbers but she survived and had her teeth done again.  &#x200B;  Then in Nov 2017 I noticed her sleeping alot more. I noticed her eye was a little red. I took her for a senior check up and the doctor found a glaucoma. I tried treating it but she lost the eye in January 2018. Lost the second in March 2018. In February I had a eye puncture done to try and save her second eye but it failed so it was removed.  &#x200B;  With each of these surgeries I thought my dog was gonna die. The eye removals and bladder stones were emergencies and yet she lived.  &#x200B;  After her eyes were gone shr was unbothered. Lived her dog life. Didnt like walkig outside that much so I pushed her in a dog stroller. She was still eating etc. She was never \"active\" or playful. Just my dog.  &#x200B;  Jump to the present:  &#x200B;  Over the last few weeks Ive had a random (unexplained) anxiety about my dog dying. Like when I got home the first thing Id do was check that she was alive(?). She was 85% the same dog. But I did notice a few things:  &#x200B;  1. She was breathing more often through her mouth while asleep. She never did this but she is a smush faced dog so....  &#x200B;  2. She was panting indoors randomly. I attributed it to overheating (due to her long coat during summer) but it ws rare so I thought nothing much of it.  &#x200B;  2. She had a period of incontinence. She was peeing in her sleep and while standing (without squatting) without realizing it. And this is a dog who HATES her own urine. The vet did a bladder check and it was clear. Then for the next 6 weeks the incontinence stopped and she started getting up to use her in house pee pads again.  &#x200B;  3. About 4 weeks ago she started eating less. Usually she eats twice a day. But she was always picky (and blind) so I figured she was just not aware of the time. I bought her some cheaper (more fragrant) dog food and mixed it with water. She ate more at first. But then started eating once a day. Then eating 90% of the food a coming back for the rest hours later. 3 weeks ago she hadnt eating for like 36 hrs so I was worried. So I gave her some plain yogurt with low fat and water mixed in. She ate it. This is when I thought her teeth might be the reason. But again she simple returned to eating semi regularly. Though her love of table food waned. (Attributed to a sore mouth).  &#x200B;  Jump to today:  &#x200B;  I took her to the vet this morning. Discussed her teeth with the vet. I wanted to know the state of her mouth. And asked if it would be better to remove her leftover 22 teeth rather than putting her under again next year when she was even older.  &#x200B;  He said he needed an xray and inspection of the mouth. To get that he would have to put her under for a short time and he would need bloodwork and a heart and lung xray.  &#x200B;  So I agreed.  &#x200B;  Bloodwork came out mostly normal. Her inflammation numbers were up. But slightly above average.(likely cause of her mouth). Her anemic levels were low (slightly below average). All her number were normal or in 1-3 points of normal.  &#x200B;  This vet went through the same process for each surgery and was confident it was fine to proceed and I agreed. I handed over my dog and waited outside.  &#x200B;  Time passed. Other people were waiting. Both vets were in the OR with my dog. I could hear a machine beeping. But I remained calm because Ive heard that sound in surgeries before. 35 mins passed. I was getting a little worried. But figured they were working on another dog and mine was up next or got delayed and procedure started much later after they took her back.  &#x200B;  Then they called me in the exam room. I swear I was about to get my dog handed to me. And they asked me to come to the back.  &#x200B;  She was lying there with tubes in her mouth. Dead.  &#x200B;  They explained this:  &#x200B;  They administered a low level of propofol and when the medicine was pushed her lungs simply stopped pumping. They said this can happen in certain situations for a few seconds with dogs but the lungs will restart pumping. Hers didnt. So they pushed medicine to reactivate the heart. But it didnt work. So they tried for like 25 minutes to revive her and failed. She passed away and they never even got to the xray and exam.  &#x200B;  What the fuck?!?  &#x200B;  I couldnt believe it. She was old. But she her major organs were all in good health. She wasnt allergic to it as all her last procedures used the exact same medicine and in higher doses for a longer time.  &#x200B;  But this time it killed her. And I cant figure out why. They explained that this happened very rarely. And online research says the same. They are a busy vet and said this happens to them once a year but rarely twice.  &#x200B;  But what I cant find is an explaination. Why would a low dose of propofol cause lungs to simply stop? The only explaination I find online are all \"veterinary negligence\" which is possible. But in the years I went there when I heard  OR machines going both vets were always back there, the same as this time. Assuming it wasnt negligence on their part,  what could have caused it? Shock? I literally can find anything on it. Like no one studies the \"unknown\" anesthetic deaths or something but that cant be true.  &#x200B;  The more I think about it the more I feel like my dog was showing yellow flags that she was in a cognitive decline. Maybe she wasnt going to die right away, but she was slowly on her way. And this procedure at this moment pushed her over the edge and she died. And whatever caused it wasnt picked up by bloodwork tests or x rays.  &#x200B;  The vets arent bad people. Its possible they fucked up. But they seemed to be in just as much shock as I was. Because theyve done this hundreds of times before and this is the first sudden death in a while. They even paid for her funeral and cremation.  &#x200B;  I always figured she would get some acute disease like kidney failure and I would have time to  process her impending death and hold her while I put her down. She died at around 11:45 this morning. Thry told me at 12:13pm. I brought her ashes home at 3:00pm. And now her urn is sitting on a shelf in front of me.  &#x200B;  I had a dog exactly 12 hours ago. And now I dont.  &#x200B;"}}

She received her PhD from the University of Antwerp in Belgium after which she came to University of Miami, initially as a post-doctoral Fellow, before advancing to her current position. Her research focuses on the genetics of neurodegenerative brain disorders. She has extensive experience working with 'big data' datasets including genotyping and next generation sequencing data, for the identification of common and rare genetic variants in disease. Dr. Nuytemans is specifically interested in Parkinson's Disease (PD) as well as Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). Everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status, should have access to personalized medicine. That is why including these disorders across diverse populations in genetic research is one of her main research foci.   **Dr Susan Halloran Blanton, PhD Bio**  Dr. Blanton received her PhD in Human Genetics from Virginia Commonwealth University/Medical College of Virginia. She obtained post-doctoral training in Biostatistics (University of Pittsburgh) and Population Oncology (Fox Chase Cancer Center). Her primary research has focused on the mapping of genes for Mendelian and complex diseases; she has been instrumental in studies identifying over twenty genes/loci for Mendelian disorders. Stroke and the underlying genetics of its risk factors, deafness, retinal diseases, skeletal dysplasias, cleft lip/palate, and clubfoot are among the diseases which she currently studies. She collaborates with Drs. Sacco, Wright and Rundek to identify genetic factors influencing white matter and cognition and their relation to ageing. In addition, she has been involved in developing and implementing genetic education materials for Federal and appellate level judges and science writers in an ELSI sponsored project.

The system can reproduce many of the key quantum mechanical phenomena including single and double slit interference, tunneling, quantization, and multi-modal statistics.

But today, an A is the most common grade given in college; the percentage of A grades has tripled, to 45 percent nationwide. Seventy-five percent of all grades awarded now are either A\u2019s and B\u2019s. The National Association of Colleges and Employers reported in 2013 that \u201c66 percent of employers screen candidates by grade point average (GPA).\u201d  &#x200B;  \"The Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation also has studied college grading. The Foundation confirms the alarming findings recited above. It found that in 1969, only 7 percent of students at two- and four-year colleges reported that their grade point average was A-minus or higher. Yet in 2009, 41 percent of students reported as same. During the same period, the percentage of C grades given dropped from 25 to five percent.\"  &#x200B;  \"Under legislation proposed in the House of Representatives, the Texas \u201cContextualized Transcript\u201d bill calls for adding to transcripts the average grade given to the entire class for each of the courses on a student\u2019s transcript.

We've gotten the very clear, unambiguous message from the dean that our classes are too easy and need to become more rigorous (which of course would reduce inflation).   &#x200B;  At first I resisted but now I see the point.

From my search, I also know a few math/stats professors from the Bay area earning around 90-95K, which I believe is not very high given the crazy cost of living there.   I know this is a very complicated question since it depends a lot on the specific city, field, institution type (private/public, R1/R2, teaching, etc.), and also the spouse, so I guess I just want to know some perspectives.

This is the place to apply for a flair \u2013 the colored text you will have seen next to some user's names indicating their specialization. We are always looking for new flaired users, and if you think you have what it takes to join the panel of historians, you're in the right place!  For examples of previous applications, and our current panel of historians, you can find the previous application thread here, and there is a list of active flaired users](/r/AskHistorians/wiki/flairedusers) on our wiki.  **[Requirements for a flair**  A flair in /r/AskHistorians indicates extensive, in-depth knowledge about an area of history *and* a proven track record of providing great answers in the subreddit. In applying for a flair, you are claiming to have:  * **Expertise in an area of history**, typically from either degree-level academic experience or an equivalent amount of self-study. For more exploration of this, check out this thread.  * The ability to **cite sources** from specialist literature for any claims you make within your area.  * The ability to provide **high quality answers** in the subreddit in accordance with our rules.    For a more in-depth look at how applications are analyzed, consult this helpful guide on our wiki explaining what an answer that demonstrates the above looks like.  **How to apply**  To apply for a flair, simply post in this thread. Your post needs to include:  * Links to **3-5 comments** in /r/AskHistorians that show you meet the above requirements, and of which at least three were posted in the last six months. Answers linked in an application should go 'above and beyond' the base requirements of the rules here, and reflect the depth of your expertise.  * The **text of your flair** and which category it belongs in (see the sidebar). Be as specific as possible as we prefer flair to reflect the exact area of your expertise as near as possible, but be aware there is a limit of 64 characters.  One of the moderators will then either confirm your flair or, if the application doesn't adequately show you meet the requirements, explain what's missing. If you get rejected, don't despair! We're happy to give you advice and pointers on how to improve your portfolio for a future application. Plenty of panelists weren't approved the first time.  If there's a backlog this may take a few days but we will try to get around to everyone as quickly as possible.  **\"I'm an Expert About Something But Never Have a Chance to Write About It!\"**  Some topics only come up once in a blue moon, but that doesn't mean you can't still get flair in it! There are a number of avenues to follow, many of which are dealt with in greater detail at the last section of this thread.  **Expected Behavior**  We invest a large amount of trust in the flaired members of /r/askhistorians, as they represent the subreddit when answering questions, participating in AMAs, and even in their participation across reddit as a whole. As such, we do take into account an applicant's user history reddit-wide when reviewing an application, and will reject applicants whose post history demonstrate bigotry, racism, or sexism. Such behavior is not tolerated in /r/askhistorians, and we do not tolerate it from our panelists in any capacity. We additionally reserve the right to revoke flair based on evidence of such behavior after the application process has been completed. /r/AskHistorians is a safe space for everyone, and those attitudes have no place here.  **Quality Contributors**  If you see an unflaired user consistently giving excellent answers, they can be nominated for a \"Quality Contributor\" flair. Just message the mods their username and some example comments which you believe meet the above criteria.  **FAQ Finder**   To apply for FAQ finder, we require demonstration of a consistent history of community involvement and linking to previous responses and the FAQ. We expect to see potential FAQ Finders be discerning in what they link to, ensuring that it is to threads which represent the current standards of the subreddit, and they do so in a polite and courteous manner, both to the 'Asker', and also by including a username ping of the original 'Answerer'.  **Revoking Flair**  Having a flair brings with it a greater expectation to abide by the subreddit's rules and maintain the high standard of discussion we all like to see here. The mods will revoke the flair of anybody who continually breaks the rules, fails to meet the standard for answers in their area of expertise, or violates the above mentioned expectations. Happily, we almost never have to do this.  **Additional Resources**  Before applying for flair, we encourage you to check out these resources to help you with the application process:  * Our Rules Roundtable on what a 'Good Answer' looks like * Our Wiki Guide on what makes a good application * The Previous Application Threads, to see what makes for successful - and not successful - applications.  * The Sunday Digest, and Monthly Awards which can provide many examples of we are looking for regarding the caliber of flaired users."}}

The synthesis took a little longer than expected and the project completion got pushed back by about a month but I had everything I needed for the communication. Then a week back he informs me that we are going to be submitting this as a full paper, and here are all of the other experiments that will need to be done. I confronted him on this saying that we had agreed to submit a communication (for which the data is compiled and ready to go), he said \"I know it's hard, quit whining.\"   I have carved out a niche for myself in this lab and made myself highly specialised with respect to what the lab traditionally does.

I feel that the preference in our tax system for capital gains instead of ordinary income is an unfair susbidy towards the rich, who earn the majority of the capital gains.  I would be ok with only taxing real capital gains (meaning over and above inflation, so if you buy a stock at $100 and sell one year later at $103 and inflation was 3%, you would not have any gain to pay taxes on).  I've seen arguments that treating capital gains differently from earned income encourages investment, but I don't see the need to subsidize investing in the stock market over working or any other thing people choose to do with their money.  Furthermore, treating capital gains differently from income encourages the rich to try to classify their income as capital gains (see carried interest for hedge fund managers).     _____  > *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

These charters are simply skimming off the cream of the crop and saying \u201csee!! Look how high our test scores are!!

They simultaneously implement an array of strategies designed to prevent undesirable students from enrolling and remove those who do manage to enroll.   Those kids can stay in the public schools or pick a different charter. Either way the traditional public schools are left with fewer students and fewer resources. And either way, poor students are getting shafted.   Charter schools are resegregating our education system to the benefit of the privileged and detriment of those most in need of help. cmv."}}

{"item": {"input": "CMV: Tipped Food Servers should earn regular minimum wage on top of any tips they may potentially receive (USA) In the example of a food server (waiter/waitress), they are hired to do a specific job.  Which normally, would be something along the lines of greeting guests, taking their orders/answering questions about the menu, delivering food/drink, collecting payment, cleaning tables and any other related tasks that the employer feels necessary (like restocking napkins/utensils or refilling condiments).  Of course, not limited to these tasks.  The job duties outlined by the employer are expected to be completed, regardless of whether or not the employee receives a tip from the customer or not.  This also leads to my opinion on tipping and that it should never be expected, but they should still be allowed to be accepted if offered.  It seems like the \"tipped employee\" wage difference is somewhat exploitative in favor of the employer, even though the employer would be required to compensate the difference if the employee did not earn at least the minimum wage in tips.  In some cases, customers return to a specific restaurant with service received having an influence on that decision.  So if a restaurant has a handful \"top\" servers that each contribute in bringing regulars weekly, the employer is essentially paying these \"top\" servers less than what they are worth to the company and it just doesn't sit right with me.

{"item": {"input": "CMV: Dating and finding a relationship is easier for the average woman compared to the average man Now, this isn't a post to bash women or how dating is easy for women. It's about how when you compare the experience of the average woman compared to the average man, it's easier for the woman to find dates and a relationship.  Let's start with an example from my personal life. Last year some friend of mine broke up. So far the woman has gone on multiple dates with three different dudes one after the other. Essentially when she decides that she doesn't like one guy she just moves on to the next one in less than a week. While my male friend hasn't had a single date so far and that's not due to a lack of trying. Now even though at the end of the day they are both still single, the women at least go on dates which mean she has a higher chance to find someone compared to the man who hasn't been on a single date.  This brings me to my first point. The average woman has a lot more options compared to the average man. I remember reading a survey that said that on average women are asked about 12 times a year compared to asking less than 1 guy out. And when we introduce online dating it gets even worse. On average a woman has a match rate of 30% while a man has 0.013%. This means that statistically, women have a lot more opportunities to meet the one compared to a man. More options are better than fewer options.  My second point comes down to the average dating strategy. The average woman is a lot more passive than a man, in the man is still the one doing the asking out and trying to impress the woman. This means that women have the option to just passively exist and they just pick and choose from their options. In addition to that, they always have the option of becoming proactive and going after the guys they want if they don't like their options. Compared that to the average guy whose only option is to actively go out looking for women and initiating stuff, since if he just stayed and waited for women to approach he will remain single.  And finally, there is the problem that till about the age of 54 there are just more men than women."}}

There's this part my boss made that has already started to be manufactured, but a company we're working with on the project wanted to revise it slightly. My boss decided that, even though I'm not on this project and didn't make this part (he did), I should be the one to make the revisions. He forwarded the email to me, which listed 2 revisions that needed to be done: increase a certain diameter and remove a certain hole.  They included a step file of the revised part, and my boss superimposed the revised part on our old part so I could see where changes needed to be made.  I made the proper changes exactly as the email stated. When I looked at the two parts superimposed, I noticed there was still a difference in the parts: this hollow cylinder extruding from the part was conical, and part of it was cut out on theirs and our part was straight with no cuts. When showing my boss the revisions I made exactly as I was instructed, I pointed out this difference and asked if our part needed to have the same cylindrical shape. He said yes, it needed to look like that, and asked me to make that revision as well. I revised the cylinder feature so it looked exactly like the step file that was sent to us. When my boss looked it over again, he got really upset that I changed the inside of the cylinder as well. Apparently, that company that sent us the revision didn't update the inside of their cylinder when they sent us the step file. Like I said, I didn't make this part so I had no way of knowing that the inside of that cylinder hasn't been revised,  It just made sense to me that if the outside was different and I needed to change it, the inside should be changed as well. I've never seen my boss more upset with me, he gave me a hard time for the rest of the day, and at one point I was fighting back tears. I don't know what I could have done differently. Is it acceptable for a company to send out partially-revised parts like that?"}}

I'm a 25 year old male (150 lbs, 6') that has had some serious pain in my feet for the last 8 months that's slowly spreading throughout my other joints. I'll do my best to outline the events and time line below:  **May 2022** \\- I woke up one morning and my second toe (next to the big toe) on my right foot was noticeably swollen with mild pain. I hadn't had any injuries or activities that would have caused this but I didn't think much of it.   **June 2022** \\- After a month of swelling, the pain slowly got worse, to the point that it was painful to walk. I went to a pediatrist and he thought it was a torn ligament in that toe. He put me on steroids for a week and saw me again. No improvement was made so he put me on another dose of the same steroid. Just like the first, nothing happened. After the meds, he decided to put me into a boot for a month.   **August 2022** \\- After a month of wearing the boot, I didn't see any improvement and noticed that the swelling was starting to spread to other toes on my right foot. This started to get me worried so I went to another pediatrist who said that it was definitely not a torn ligament. His guess was that it was gout. He did a uric acid blood test, which came back negative but still decided to put me on alopurinol for a few weeks to see if it did anything. After I finished the meds, no improvement had been made and the pain and swelling was getting worse.   **September 2022** \\- By this point I was getting desperate and started to look other places to see if it was caused by something else. I went to an internal medicine doctor that did a full blood panel to see if any of my levels were off. The panel came back completely nonreal, even noting that once again the uric acid levels were normal. He didn't have any suggestions as to what could be causing the foot pain and swelling. By this point, the swelling had spread to all the toes on the right foot and the pain was very prominent around the joint of the big toe and the bottom side of all the toes in the metatarsal area.   **October 2022** \\- By this point, I was starting to have swelling on my big toe on the left foot and was getting sharp pain in my right hip area, deep within the glute, that was making it really difficult to move around. I went to go see an orthopedic surgeon to see if he had any ideas as to what this would be. He said that he had never seen anything like this, and even brought his colleague in to see if they had any ideas. They were both stumped and told me to try stem cell treatment that wasn't covered by insurance. I didn't want to jump into that without getting an actual diagnosis so I wasn't throwing away money.   **December 2022** \\- By this point I'm completly at my wits end trying to figure out what this is and not having any doctors know what it is. The swelling has gotten really bad in the right foot, causing dark colors around all the joints of the toes, especially in the mornings. My right knee has also started to get swollen and has similar pain to the toes, especially when the knee is straightened.  My next step is to see a rheumatologist but they are booked out until February. I'm hoping that one of you have an idea that could help me out.   TLDR: Woke up one morning with a swollen and painful toe. The swelling has spread to all the toes on the right foot and has been extremely painful.  Discoloration on the joints of all the toes, especially in the morning. Pain has now spread to the right knee and right hip/glute area. Been treated for torn ligament and gout with no results or relief."}}

{"item": {"input": "CMV: Liberals should abandon identity politics and instead focus on class/economic issues Identity Politics (IP) is largely unhelpful and extremely divisive. The focus on identity by liberals alienates other people on the left and creates huge distance from those in the middle and those on the right. Class/economic issues, such as wealth inequality and ending crony capitalism, are far more unifying messages for those who hold liberal ideology. Alleviating class/economic issues would also have downstream positive impact on many other issues (often championed by IP) such as racial inequality.  Proponents of IP get caught up too often in the characteristics of the individuals making political arguments \u2013 practically by design. The speaker therefore is weighted according to inherent traits they happened to be born with (race, gender, sexual orientation). This creates an environment in which large portions of the population/electorate (i.e. straight, white, male) feel that their opinions and issues are valued less than others. The resulting atmosphere, exacerbated deliberately by right leaning talking points, causes many to abandon the left.  Class/economic issues should become the leading message for liberals, given the broader appeal it would naturally have. Discussing and championing issues of income distribution/poverty/corruption would reach a much larger population and could pull many in the middle and on the right back toward the left. This would not only be practically useful for political reasons, but would also have a net positive impact on many of the class-related social issues that we see in society.     _____  > *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

But, like...he's a time traveler. *Everything* that is happening is his past from the perspective of some Eobard Thawne.  Whenever I meet him, there's another Professor Zoom for which this is the past, and he could show up here and say hello (or murder me, more likely. He's a dick).  So- how can anyone do anything to him? If I stab him, I'm altering his past so he was stabbed at one point, right? So I can't stab him. Or I can't *not* stab him. I can drop the knife and he still gets a stab wound because me altering his past and not stabbing him doesn't affect him. It seems we've got some weird form of spooky determinism where I can just leave and either he'll be walking around with my spine despite the fight not happening or he gets all the wounds of being beaten up from nowhere. After all, surely any degree of interaction is altering his past, even if only to an utterly insignificant degree?  For that matter, can *he* alter his timeline? Does he even have free will with this power?  This raises a lot of questions. What does \"immunity to causality\" actually mean? How does he interact with *anything* if his life cannot be changed?"}}

Me and his mother haven\u2019t been together since before he was born as we broke up when she was pregnant. We agreed we didn\u2019t want to be with each other but wanted to do right by our son. However long story short, I did a peace of mind DNA test (private - not legally binding) found out he wasn\u2019t mine. However I want to just carry on raising him as i love him as if he were my own son and have been having every weekend since he was born and some days in the week. We have a very loving rather & son relationship and he calls me Daddy. However she is aware that I am not the biological father and the real father is not interested and is staying away. Here is the kicker, she seems to have it in her head that now I have a gf who also has a child, she kicks off all the time even though absolutely nothing with my son has changed, not the relationship with him, time spent with him, nothing. I have no idea why on earth she is so bitter towards me other than catching her out I guess. She has already said that my gf can never meet him as she doesn\u2019t like her (literally never met or spoken to her) if she does she will take me to court have my name taken off the certificate and bye bye.

{"item": {"input": "CMV: We (as in Western society) have seemingly stopped trying to build better lives for our children For 100s of years it seemed appropriate to view Western society as building a better life for our children:  * houses were built to last (the house I live in is from the 17th century), so were a permanent improvement to the village/town * education systems were built and expanded in years taught * roads * electrification/other utilities (e.g. water, sewage, gas, etc.) * healthcare systems * police/armed forces to keep people safe * fire brigades   However, it seems since the post-war period we have built very little to benefit our children. The only thing I can think of is the internet (and associate infrastructure), but as this isn't even permanent - websites seem more like temporary structures that are designed to be demolished and replaced than permanent improvements.  Houses built in the post-war (to modern day) period seem designed in the same way: temporary structures of wood rather than stone.

She's a Project Manager. From the beginning the team and I have been confused on what her role exactly is. When I would send her some emails, she would reply to me with an attitude. I let it go in the beginning but later when working together she started being more and more rude. Whenever I ask her questions she usually goes to our manager to tattle (same manager) and my manager does one of the following: sends out an email to everyone, call me directly with Amy's question, or tell me in the meeting with the team about my concern.  The issues have gotten worse lately. It has made a very toxic environment for me. I'm sure my boss knows of the issues. I got a very nasty email from Amy today, my boss was added in the email and said nothing of it. I see that my boss is on her side. Boss has been working around 6 years too.   I reached out to HR to ask if she is available to meet. I would like to show her the email evidence of how Amy has been replying to me. I have been asking HR about what happens when someone leaves, do they get their vacation time paid in full, etc. I have been so stressed to the point that I want to resign.

Over the weekend, my boyfriend, our friend, and I went on a trip to the coast. We were driving back to Sacramento early in the morning when there was an accident. We were driving through a rural area on a highway, going 65, and it was pitch black. From what I could tell in the dark and at my distance, and with the speed in which things were happening, it looked like two cars collided and debris was all over the road. I braked hard and went to avoid the cars but hit some debris so I pulled over.   When I got out to check my vehicle, I ran back to the scene to see what I hit and discovered a body in the far right lane. I went on auto pilot and called 911. I did my best to explain where we were and what happened. There was another body on the ground a couple lanes away from the first, and a girl screaming and pinned under a car. I stayed with her while bystanders and my passengers did their best to make the scene safer by redirecting traffic.  When police arrived we got together with them and lifted the car off the girl. She had a severe head injury. I stayed with her until the paramedics arrived which was also about when she stopped breathing. I have no idea if she made it, or what her quality of life will be if she did.  After the paramedics took over I broke down and walked back to my car. I cried heavily for a couple of minutes. An officer approached me and my passengers and took our statements. I told them I think I hit someone and they tried to convince me I only hit debris. I was not convinced, and leaned under my car with my phone flash light on and found blood and bits of...flesh or brain, smeared all over my car's belly and hanging down from the heat shields and exhaust system. I was angry with the officer for blowing me off and trying to get us to leave. I had a literal crime scene under my f\\*cking car.  Eventually they decided there were three separate incidents. An officer gave me a card with his badge number and the incident number. He took my insurance information and took pictures of my vehicle, but only took one picture of my vehicle's underside from the front. Remember this was pitch black rural territory with no streetlights. Then he told us that they had everything they needed, that we could go, and to just take my car to a car wash and rinse it off really good, which is absolutely mortifying imo but what else are you supposed to do??  I'm asking if there is anything else I can do. It the daylight you can see better just how much human remains are smeared and hanging off my undercarriage. I doubt the evidence that was collected and I had the thought to have a local CHP officer come out and take additional photos and send them to the officers who responded (we drove straight home from there after that, skipping Sacramento altogether. I don't feel comfortable stating where I live here but I do live in California). I haven't washed my car yet and I would like to do so as soon as possible...I need to get rid of that smell, and I need to have my transmission looked at because it doesn't sound good after what happened.  I just don't know if this could be used against me. I feel like not because of the way the officers were treating the situation, trying to convince me I didn't hit a literal human and trying to get me to leave. Barely taking pictures and all. But I don't know. I just don't know. I'm sorry if I'm asking stupid questions I just want to do everything I possibly and reasonably can. I didn't see what I hit, and if I did, avoiding it could have put myself and my passengers at further risk. The incident was spread across the highway taking up all three lanes and even the shoulders on either side. I just didn't want to collide with the vehicles in the wreckage.  I also want to find out, if legally possible, if there were survivors. One paramedic said the two bodies were gone, but was vague about the girl. I've spoken with my friends, some of whom are medical professionals, about the injury she sustained and the potential for her survival, and no one seems to think that with a head injury like that than anyone could live and if they could, their quality of life wouldn't be great. An article I found online describing the incident states there was one fatality and two taken to the hospital with major injuries, which obviously conflicts with what the paramedic told me. I also want to know if my impact with that passenger killed him, because the article (if it's accurate, who knows) states that the only person who died was the one my vehicle collided with and if the other two people initially survived their ejection, I have reason to believe the man I hit was also alive.  So would it be in my best interest to just rinse off my car and move on with my life, and not try to get more information to the officers? Do they need more information? I feel awful and selfish for asking such a question, but my heart goes out to those people and I want to do everything I can. But I also don't want to have the family members come after me. There's nothing I could have done differently that would have been safer or better. And no amount of evidence or whatever is going to bring that man back to life. Either way, whether he was dead or alive before I hit him, nothing is going to bring him back to life. And I have to live with that.  Also, how can I legally and respectfully find out if the other two people survived? Would it be a bad idea to tell the officers to give my phone number to the family members? I don't know what I would tell them...I don't know. I just don't know how to proceed and I don't want to do something to make things worse.  Thank you for your advice and I'm sorry if I'm asking stupid selfish questions or being insensitive I don't mean to be I just really need to know. Also, if there is anything I'm maybe not thinking about or considering please share. Thank you."}}

I feel I would have definitely noticed considering the size. Now like I said I got up about 20mins ago to pee and it\u2019s gotten even bigger and worse in pain and I also just noticed my right ear is bruised.  I know now everything is getting progressively worse quite fast and I should go get it checked but I\u2019m scared it\u2019s more than just swollen lymph node/tumour and the cost considering I\u2019m a permanent resident not a citizen. I\u2019m extremely anxious and stressed, I can feel something is very wrong with my body, I\u2019m always weak and lack energy and idk how to prepare myself to hear the news. I\u2019m not even sure I can walk to the car then from the car to the hospital without fainting. When I stand or walk around my head gets so intense and body goes numb in less than a minute I lose control. Can you guys give me possibilities of what to prepare for so I\u2019m not phased when I hear bad new out loud? I have 2 more days til I go get checked and at this point I think having an idea of what to expect will bring a little peace of mind.    Sorry this post is all over the place, still heavy sleep deprived so I\u2019m going to try sleep now and will check if any replies when I wake"}}

I'm a current undergraduate student studying physics and math, but planning to continue into grad school by studying atmospheric science. I'm strongly considering a career in academia as I believe I would love the balance between performing research and teaching students. One of my main concerns though is that I wouldn't get much of a choice in where I would end up geographically. For example, I'm from the midwest USA and would love to remain in the area whenever I get a career (to be somewhat close to family, etc.).  How much of a choice do you really get in where you ended up geographically? Is the job market competitive enough that you ultimately took the first opportunity that came up no matter the location? Or did you wait for an opportunity in your ideal location/region of the world/country? Or was it somewhere in the middle? I'm aware this is probably entirely different for everyone, but I'm curious what the range has been like for everyone.   Being in the field of STEM I'd specifically love to hear from others in this field, but would greatly appreciate help from any areas of study. I'd love to hear about what your experience of getting into the career was like and if you have any suggestions! Any advice and comments would be greatly appreciated!"}}

Hi, I'm Dr. Christina Nicolaidis and I'm editor of a brand new peer-reviewed journal called Autism in Adulthood. I teach social work at Portland State University and internal medicine at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, Oregon.  There's a lot of talk about autism in children, but not as much about autism among adults.  That's why we just launched this new academic journal. Our goal is to cover the most pressing issues affecting autistic adults, from emerging adulthood to later life. I am particularly excited about including autistic adults in our new journal - as editorial board members, authors, reviewers and readers. As a doctor and a services researcher, my own research is focused on how people on the autism spectrum can get better access to health care services. Many autistic adults don't get the health care they need, resulting in more health problems and shorter life expectancy.  Ask me anything about the new journal or the ways that people on the autism spectrum can get better care.   We'll be on at 1 p.m. Pacific (4 PM ET, 21 UT), we're looking forward to the session!"}}

{"item": {"input": "CMV: The diversity added into Amazon's Wheel of Time series added nothing, and was a net loss for the show. I want to start by saying that I'm a full hearted supporter of adding diversity into screen adaptations of stories from other media. I consider diversity to be of benefit in its own right. Diversity for its own sake is a positive thing.  That said, the diversity Amazon added to Wheel of Time was a net loss for the story and the show. I'll discuss two examples here: the gender of the potential Dragon Reborn, and the racial diversity of Emond's Field, the Two rivers, and the world writ large. Neither of these additions added more than they detracted from the story, and both were unnecessary. It's been a while since I read the books, so if I miss a detail, let me know. Also, feel free to bring up other examples besides these two.  To start with, gender diversity isn't something lacking in the Wheel of Time. That I can think of now, there are between 6 and 8 main protagonists, depending on where you draw the line; 3 male, and either 3 or 5 female. The rest of the story suffers no shortage of female representation either, the vast majority of the rest of the characters our protagonists interact with are women. The Aes Sedai, by far the most powerful faction of sorts in the world is made up very exclusively of women. A huge percentage of the most important secondary and tertiary characters in the books are from this group, as well as some extremely important female characters we haven't met yet in the show, so I won't discuss them here in the body of the post in order to avoid spoilers. So, when the writers of the show decided to open up the possibility of the Dragon Reborn being a woman, they didn't add a needed element of diversity.  They did, however, muddy a very important detail in the saga of the Dragon Reborn: that the Aes Sedai have been preparing for a Dragon that would not and could not *ever* be one of them. They would never be able to exert direct control of him. For 3000 years the Aes Sedai have planned and plotted and positioned so that when the Dragon Reborn came, they would have the ability to entangle him and create the circumstances they wanted at the end. This also came with the added promise that regardless of who exactly the Dragon Reborn is, their use of the male half of the one power would all but inevitably drive him insane. The debate over how to handle his reemergence was one of the most important and hotly debated topics for millennia. Some thought it would be best to kidnap him, and prevent him from using his abilities until the very end, thus preserving his sanity. Some thought it would be best to try to teach him to resist the insanity, and train him as best they could to harness his strength. While not a huge thing, the hope for the Aes Sedai that they could simply absorb a female Dragon Reborn (as certainly would have been their plan, one which they would have succeeded at) feels like a loss of history and storytelling.   Bigger than that though is the racial diversity the creators foisted upon the Emond's Field and the rest of the world. Like with gender representation, racial representation and diversity isn't in any way missing from the world of Wheel of Time. We visit all parts of the world, and like our own world, each region and country has a predominant race and culture that mirrors those we have here in reality. This is where I might mess some things up, especially given that none of these comparisons are explicitly expressed in the books, but rather easy-to-make inferences based on skin color, culture, and architecture. Tear is largely Arabic, Sheinar is largely southeast Asian, Illian is largely east African, Saldea is largely Persian, Cairhien is largely eastern European, Ghealdon is largely northwest African/Spanish, Andor is largely western European, and the Aiel are largely pre-European colonization North American - albeit with red hair. The list goes on, but I think you get the picture. Of course, very few areas, and especially cities are entirely homogenous, but just like a white person would stick out in Kyoto, a black person would stick out in Amadacia.  The intershuffling of races just wasn't at all necessary, and really took a chunk out of the credibility of one of Moiraine's first important statements, \"The blood of Manetheren runs deep in the Two Rivers.\" The Two Rivers and Especially Emond's Field is *extremely* homogenous. It's a town of only a couple hundred people, and virtually no one ever leaves or moves there. Some people living outside of Emond's Field in the Two Rivers don't even know it exists. How am I supposed to believe that all of the inhabitants of Emond's Field are directly descended from Manetheren when they're all of clearly divergent ancestry? If the creators wanted to say that Manetheren was itself diverse, make everyone in Emond's Field mixed race. Not a difficult solution, and far better for the world building. If you're worried that doing so would make all the protagonists look more or less the same, don't.  More important though, is that for a show that will jump back and forth across the world constantly, diversifying every country on the map makes it a lot harder for the audience to know where the hell the scene on screen is taking place. They have a *ton* of ground to cover, both figuratively and literally, in telling even the very watered down version they plan to. Every second counts, and the characters all move around a lot, but now we'll either lose time to wide angle shots of each location every time, or simply won't know where we are half the time.  Please use the spoiler button if you want to talk specifics that haven't yet been covered in the show."}}

Ok, I almost guarantee this has been posted on here before but after I skimmed the \u201cnew\u201d section for a few minutes I didn\u2019t see it so I figured sure why not.   I\u2019m gonna start this by saying I completely stand behind BLM and the peaceful protests across America and the world in their fight for equal rights and just protection under the law. I think there are many instances of police brutality and blatant homicide by LEO but this is not a very good example. Im just gonna break it down from my POV to start. the confrontation started with them politely asking a man to move his car out of the drive through because it was in the way of everyone else. After he failed a sobriety test, clearly showing he was drunk, they did what they\u2019re taught to do and calmly tell him he\u2019s under arrest and that he needs to come with them. As they surround him to put him in handcuffs, not showing any kind of aggression or hostility that is common among LEO, he tries to shake both of them off.   He proceeds to physically engage both officers, punching them and throwing them off him, they discharge their tasers but he seems relatively unaffected. He then steals one and manages to get by both officers, running away. He points the taser at the officer chasing him and the officer shoots him to stop him.   It\u2019s tragic, no doubt, and to be fair I\u2019m not even trying to defend the officer, he deserves some reprimand for his actions but he shouldn\u2019t be charged with multiple, serious offenses leading to many years of jail time. I think yes, the situation could\u2019ve been handled much better, and he should be fired for his hasty actions but I think there is a place where we need to draw the line.   In my eyes, the officer, highly trained and armed, is taught to stop the criminal no matter what, in his eyes, this man just drove drunk, assaulted two officers, stole a taser, and attempted to discharge the weapon on another officer. A weapon that has been described by the state as potentially deadly and which, he has been told to take as a direct threat. I don\u2019t think this is not so much on the officer rather the system and the state.   I\u2019m not trying to discredit the protests or their fight, nor even this mans life. I completely respect all of those, but I mean, what was he supposed to do? He didn\u2019t have a secondary weapon, he wasn\u2019t likely to catch him on foot, I think, again, it\u2019s excessive, and he should be fired, but his alternatives was to watch a criminal run away with a \u201clethal\u201d weapon. You can even hear him on the video trying to say things to brooks like \u201cstay with me\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t stop breathing\u201d so I definitely don\u2019t think it\u2019s a lack of moral or humanity on the part of the officer.   Tbh I\u2019ve had it explained so many different ways, I\u2019m not even sure what to think rn, but this is the best way I think I can put it from my view. Feel free to completely discredit me, I welcome any and all criticism, if with some hesitation, as that\u2019s how we grow as people. Thank you for attending my TED talk."}}

Since I graduated, I've been working for a consulting company in an industry I was really excited about and I'm.....bored. The interesting parts of this job aren't challenging, the challenging parts aren't interesting, and I'm constantly racing the clock trying to get hastily-designed parts out the door.   &#x200B;  So I've been casting my eyes about for new opportunities, but the city I live in isn't exactly an engineering hub (yes, I know I can just move, but I have young kids and a wife who loves it here, so it's not quite as simple as packing up my pocket protectors and hopping in the car), which leads me back to the title question - are you/do you know someone with an engineering degree who works in a field outside of, or adjacent to, engineering? What do you do?"}}
{"item": {"input": "Weekly discussion - Shopping at the Asian grocery Most every American city, and a surprising number of smaller towns, has at least one grocery store catering to the local east Asian community. Mostly stocked with Chinese ingredients, but often with a good supply of Korean or Japanese products depending on the local demographics, with very little labeled in English, they can be mysterious and intimidating for non-Asians who want to broaden their culinary horizons.  This week, I'd like to assemble a guide for those who are considering venturing to their local Asian grocery for the first time.   What ingredients are worth making the trip for? What are your shopping strategies to ensure you come home with the makings of a meal? Do you have advice on soliciting help from staff with whom you don't share a language? How do you make sense of the array of soy sauces?   And for actual Asian redditors, if there's a small American grocery in your city, how do you shop there?"}}

I know you have to let the dough rise once, then again after shaping.  My questions: Can I just stick any bread dough in the fridge for an overnight bulk fermentation (then shape and proof again at room temp the next day). Will I have to adjust the recipe? Could I also shape them and keep in the fridge overnight? How long is too long in the fridge?   New to bread, so lots of questions... thanks!"}}

{"item": {"input": "How do you define work/life balance? So I'm an entry level mechanical engineer, been working as an EIT for over 2 years now. My company is very flexible when it comes to hours worked, but of course us salaried employees have to get at least 40 hours.  Part of my performance evaluation a while ago, my boss indirectly told me that I should be working more than 40 hours. Now I don't think he's a bad boss, but I think I'm being unfairly compared to the senior engineers that regularly work 50-60 hours every week. This being my first job out of college, I didn't want to argue with him about it.   But the whole time we were having that conversation, I was thinking what the hell. Is 40 hours not enough these days? I'm a young, fairly inexperienced EIT. This means I don't have a ton of responsibilities, i.e. managing projects or leading the design teams on huge projects. So if I'm getting my work done on time & meeting my deadlines, why should I be working more than 40 hours?  Of course, there are days or even weeks when it's crunch time & in the past I've worked over 50 hours before, but that's pretty rare. To me, maintaining a work/life balance is very important - I don't want to drown myself in work just because that was the norm for the previous generation.  Is this common across other companies? What about for your specific role & rank? If I'm already being asked to work more than 40 hours as an EIT, I'm sure that will be the expected norm as I progress the ranks."}}
{"item": {"input": "CMV: If you are a high school student who wants to reduce the chances of a shooting at your school, inviting the guy who is going to shoot up the school to participate in your life is likely to be much more effective than walking out of school to protest gun laws. Staging a walkout to bring attention to gun laws and get congress to enact some ambiguously defined \"common sense gun control\" legislation is unlikely to have *any* impact whatsoever.  If nothing was done after Sandy Hook when Democrats were in power, I'm not sure why you think protesting is going to bring chance while Republicans are in power.  What *could* have a significant impact, especially at your particular school, is to reach out to the guy who is going to be shooting up the school and include him in your life.  Whenever a school shooting occurs, the students are rarely surprised at who the shooter is.  Take a poll of 20 students at your average high school, and you're going to hear the same 2-3 names come up over and over and over again again when asking \"who is most likely to shoot up the school\".  Kids are still bullied, ostracized and dehumanized just as much today as they were in 1999. It's been 20 years and we've tried to blame video games, mental health and gun accessibility. We still haven't addressed the core issued: People being dicks to each other.  Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, Red Lake, Columbine and now Parkland. These shootings aren't being done by the popular starting football quarterback. They're being done by the guy who is pushed in the hallway. They guy who is laughed at, or worse, when he dares to smile at or talk to a girl. The guy who teachers would rather exclude from the classroom than reach out to and help.  More succinctly, the guy who is treated like a bug being squashed on the sidewalk, rather than being treated as an actual human being.  If the other students made a point to include that person in life, rather than continuing to ostracize, mock and humiliate him, the likelihood of him shooting up the school is going to drop significantly.  Invite him over to play video games.  Ask him to join you at McDonald's after the game.  Be a positive influence in his life.  Kids that are included in high school life don't shoot up the school.  Kids that have a friend group don't shoot up the school.  Kids that are treated as human beings don't shoot up the school.  Kids that are treated as less-than-human shoot up the school."}}

{"item": {"input": "The decision to euthanize my kitten is destroying me I have a 6 month old kitten named Bubbles. He was originally a foster who had \u201cpneumonia\u201d but when he wasn\u2019t improving I adopted him so I could take over his medical care.   After seeing 4 vets, including specialists, multiple xrays, blood work, and cardiology appointments, it was determined that he has an entire host of congenital defects. His lungs completely lack blood flow in the front, his heart has a bad valve, he has bone marrow issues, and kidney issues.   The thing is, he behaves like he\u2019s perfectly fine. He plays and runs and jumps and purrs. He\u2019s adorable and full of fun. The vet said he behaves this way because his defects are all he\u2019s ever known so he is used to feeling bad. But the vet also said that as he grows, his body will struggle more and that he is a ticking time bomb for catastrophic health failure and that he likely wouldn\u2019t die instantly but suffer before we could get him to the vet. She said it\u2019s not if but when and could happen anytime.  I love him so much. I don\u2019t want to euthanize him. But he is becoming sexually mature and we can\u2019t neuter him because he wouldn\u2019t survive anesthesia. He\u2019s starting to get pissy to our other cats. But also, I\u2019m constantly afraid for him, I dread the moment that he begins to suffer and hurt. Every time he is out of my sight I wonder if he\u2019s in a corner gasping for air.  Some people in my life have said I should wait to euthanize until he is suffering. The vet said with all of his issues it is appropriate to euthanize at any point, and this has been confirmed by 4 other vets. My thinking is that I\u2019d rather his last day be a happy day and not one where he is in agony. I am considering calling the mobile vet to come to our house to euthanize in the next week or so.  I\u2019m literally gutted by this. I don\u2019t know what plan is right. He can\u2019t survive his issues and they can\u2019t be treated. Do I euthanize before he declines or give him every good day he can have?  I just need some words of wisdom. I\u2019m paralyzed by grief and indecision."}}

They told me they were looking for someone with a name I hadn\u2019t ever heard. I don\u2019t know this person and have never seen them a day in my life. I then asked them to show me a picture and again told them I don\u2019t know who tf that is and he doesn\u2019t live here! They told me that they\u2019re coming in regardless of whether I want them to so we can \u201cdo this the easy way or the hard way\u201d. This whole situation was so random and bizarre it\u2019s 1am and I still can\u2019t get past what happened today still has me panicking with anxiety. I have glass in my foot making it hard to walk since I have to limp and just the sheer terror of initially thinking it was a burglar. They all treated me as if I were lying and hiding a boyfriend or something. They kept trying to trip me up in a \u201clie\u201d and I was so confused while they were using dumb police interrogation tactics.  Only me and my 10 year old child live here and they broke his bedroom window which was near my head when I fell asleep in his room but thankfully no cuts in my face. Just my foot and almost my cats paws. As they\u2019re storming my apartment shouting for \u201cLarry so and so\u201d they\u2019re asking me where my child is what his name is what his dads name is and his dads address and all kinds of crazy sh*t! Trying to get all my personal info beyond my name that I gave them. I offered to show them my lease, my USPS informed delivery to show this person gets no mail here and I told them there are cameras where they can easily see he has never been here and isn\u2019t inside. They didn\u2019t identify themselves to me even know I kept referring to them as police since I thought they were but they finally said \u201cwe\u2019re not police\u201d but nothing else. I didn\u2019t know they were bounty hunters until someone told me they were after the fact. I wasn\u2019t given the ability to look at the arrest warrant either to even verify that the address is my address. I looked up the persons info who they\u2019re looking for and it shows an address in another city that an apt building but it shows 5 different apt #\u2019s under his list of previous residences which leads me to believe he lived at both complexes and gave all those random unit #\u2019s out to obviously conceal his real address since he likes to go on the run and not show up to court. They also lied and said that they broke 1 window pane and failed to mention that they broke both but also bent up the screen. They also lied and said that they provided their info yet I don\u2019t know any of their names or what bail company they are so I have no idea how to get my address removed! Otherwise it\u2019ll be an endless cycle of them storming my home looking for a whole stranger. They said that they\u2019re paying for the window so obviously they know they weren\u2019t within their right otherwise they wouldn\u2019t be paying for it. This is criminal to me though because how can they break through my window for someone they have never seen here? They didn\u2019t hear any voices either because I was asleep. I didn\u2019t have the TV on either. Now I\u2019m left with my window still open at 1 in the morning because maintenance at my Apts never showed up and I can\u2019t get this glass out of my foot. Sorry this was long and maybe kind of ranty but thank you for reading all the way through and enlightening me on the law regarding this. The officer I called to make a report simply said \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about bounty hunter laws so you\u2019ll have to call them to see what they \u201cpolicy\u201d is\u201d lmao as if a \u201cpolicy\u201d is above the law and as if they\u2019re going to admit to me that they broke it.   The police offered me No insight in regards to how I go about clearing this address issue up so it doesn\u2019t happen in the future. They all keep saying to call the bail company yet can\u2019t give me the name of it because they say they don\u2019t have it. Even if I did call them how would they remove my address when I\u2019ve already told them face to face that that person doesn\u2019t live here and that I don\u2019t even know them? I\u2019ve already told them this and they don\u2019t believe me so at the end of the day Police are refusing my report for them intentionally breaking the window and they\u2019re not telling me how to prevent it in the future. Literally no one except door dash drivers and uber drivers have my address. I\u2019ve always been private about my home in general. I don\u2019t know why this person used my addess other than me assuming they\u2019re giving a fake address because they never planned on going to court and don\u2019t want county hunters at THEIR door. Smh. Police tell me that they \u201cbroke the window civilly so since there is no intent, it\u2019s not criminal\u201d.

The car will be racing in a race where there are periods during which it's *not* accelerating.   - For example - a drag race, where a car sits for *minutes* doing nothing at the starting line, before having to rapidly accelerate.  - For example - a rally, where there are periods when a car's engine has the *capacity* to accelerate more but the driver momentarily wishes to keep the car slower for more control; followed by other periods where the driver wishes to accelerate faster than the engine can allow.  Now suppose you connect the car's engine to a flywheel as well as the car's wheels.  The engine can send the entirety of its power to the wheels by temporarily disconnecting the flywheel.  Somehow, it can also power the wheels a little bit while also spinning up the flywheel.  When the driver requires it, the flywheel can be connected to the wheels, relieving it of its own momentum to spin up the wheels even more.     - On a race's starting line, a driver would use the car's engine to spin up the flywheel.  The moment the lights go green, the driver steps on the gas.  The car's computer connects the engine and the flywheel to the wheels.  The momentum stored in the flywheel allows the car to accelerate much faster than a normal car, whose wheels can only be driven by the engine alone.  - During a period of a rally race where the driver needs to control their speed, the engine might rev up faster than it normally would, for the speed the car's travelling at.  The extra power is sent to the flywheel to spin it up.  The momentum of the flywheel could be used later to help the car accelerate faster when necessary.  This would be similar to regenerative braking, except instead of using the brakes to power the flywheel the engine itself would be used to power the flywheel.    My questions are:   - Is this possible, or is it really dumb?  - Why aren't these systems used in real life?  Is it due to the engineering complexity?  Due to the mass of the flywheel?  - Are there any other places it could be used?  (For example - perhaps it's too heavy for a racing car, but could be useful in a tank.)"}}
{"item": {"input": "Where are the actual engineering jobs? I'm an EE with 7years experience and am stuck in my career, any advice would be appreciated.  **TLDR**: Are there jobs that involve challenging EE work instead of the bureaucratic nightmare that I'm currently trapped in? and how do I find them?  **Background**: I left my previous company after a year of doing near zero engineering work, in my new company I'm finding myself in the same situation.   **Experiences**: In my first job out of college I was writing firmware, designing 12-layer PCBs, troubleshooting at the component level, all my time was spent reading datasheets, it was great, but the pay was terrible and nowhere else to go within the company, so I moved on.  Since leaving that position, both companies I have been with since have had great pay, but the engineering work and internal bureaucracies are a joke.  Both job descriptions listed out the kinds of things I wanted to do, but I'm doing none of those.  From what I can see, any engineering work that does happen is completely hamstrung by mismanagement and internal bureaucracy.  I spend my time waiting for work and attending meetings where no one can determine an owner for otherwise very (VERY) simple problems that drag on for months.  I'm bored, not learning anything, and frustrated by the inefficiency.    **Example**: We need a very basic PDU to upgrade a station.  I spec'd out the PDU (real straight forward).  I'm now a dozen meetings and two months in and I'm still giving presentations on it, not about technical requirements (no one wants to hear those) but because I need to explain that there is an old PDU, and due to internal standards, we need a new one.  I did this at my previous job, and I'm doing it again at my current one, I'm losing my mind.  **Current Outlook**:  I realize that I'm new to the company, not going to get the fun projects right away, but I am in the meetings where they are discussed.  The work is spread out over a committee people who'd rather spend more time shrugging their shoulders than having any technical discussion.  Any mention of this to management has been met with enigmatic \"work is coming\" with no elaboration or plans to prepare for that work.  **Future plans**: I don't want to make a habit of jumping jobs, that's no good for a resume, but I can't deal with the boredom, and feeling my skills languish from lack of use is killing me.   How do I find a job with challenging technical problems and the agency to solve them?  I'm considering going back to school, but haven't determined if that will help.  I'm also considering a career change, probably to software, or frankly, literally anything else.  Conclusion: How do I find a job with actual technical problems? or is my experience in the EE field just how it is?"}}

{"item": {"input": "YOU Can Help to Answer Questions \u2022 The /r/AskHistorians Flair Application Thread XXI! Welcome flair applicants! This is the place to apply for a flair \u2013 the colored text you will have seen next to some user's names indicating their specialization. We are always looking for new flaired users, and if you think you have what it takes to join the panel of historians, you're in the right place!  For examples of previous applications, and our current panel of historians, you can find the previous application thread here, and there is a list of active flaired users](/r/AskHistorians/wiki/flairedusers) on our wiki.  **[Requirements for a flair**  A flair in /r/AskHistorians indicates extensive, in-depth knowledge about an area of history *and* a proven track record of providing great answers in the subreddit. In applying for a flair, you are claiming to have:  * **Expertise in an area of history**, typically from either degree-level academic experience or an equivalent amount of self-study. For more exploration of this, check out this thread.  * The ability to **cite sources** from specialist literature for any claims you make within your area.  * The ability to provide **high quality answers** in the subreddit in accordance with our rules.    For a more in-depth look at how applications are analyzed, consult this helpful guide on our wiki explaining what an answer that demonstrates the above looks like.  **How to apply**  To apply for a flair, simply post in this thread. Your post needs to include:  * Links to **3-5 comments** in /r/AskHistorians that show you meet the above requirements, and of which at least three were posted in the last six months. Answers linked in an application should go 'above and beyond' the base requirements of the rules here, and reflect the depth of your expertise.  * The **text of your flair** and which category it belongs in (see the sidebar). Be as specific as possible as we prefer flair to reflect the exact area of your expertise as near as possible, but be aware there is a limit of 64 characters.  One of the moderators will then either confirm your flair or, if the application doesn't adequately show you meet the requirements, explain what's missing. If you get rejected, don't despair! We're happy to give you advice and pointers on how to improve your portfolio for a future application. Plenty of panelists weren't approved the first time.  If there's a backlog this may take a few days but we will try to get around to everyone as quickly as possible.  **\"I'm an Expert About Something But Never Have a Chance to Write About It!\"**  Some topics only come up once in a blue moon, but that doesn't mean you can't still get flair in it! There are a number of avenues to follow, many of which are dealt with in greater detail at the last section of this thread.  **Expected Behavior**  We invest a large amount of trust in the flaired members of /r/askhistorians, as they represent the subreddit when answering questions, participating in AMAs, and even in their participation across reddit as a whole. As such, we do take into account an applicant's user history reddit-wide when reviewing an application, and will reject applicants whose post history demonstrate bigotry, racism, or sexism. Such behavior is not tolerated in /r/askhistorians, and we do not tolerate it from our panelists in any capacity. We additionally reserve the right to revoke flair based on evidence of such behavior after the application process has been completed. /r/AskHistorians is a safe space for everyone, and those attitudes have no place here.  **Quality Contributors**  If you see an unflaired user consistently giving excellent answers, they can be nominated for a \"Quality Contributor\" flair. Just message the mods their username and some example comments which you believe meet the above criteria.  **FAQ Finder**   To apply for FAQ finder, we require demonstration of a consistent history of community involvement and linking to previous responses and the FAQ. We expect to see potential FAQ Finders be discerning in what they link to, ensuring that it is to threads which represent the current standards of the subreddit, and they do so in a polite and courteous manner, both to the 'Asker', and also by including a username ping of the original 'Answerer'.  **Revoking Flair**  Having a flair brings with it a greater expectation to abide by the subreddit's rules and maintain the high standard of discussion we all like to see here. The mods will revoke the flair of anybody who continually breaks the rules, fails to meet the standard for answers in their area of expertise, or violates the above mentioned expectations. Happily, we almost never have to do this.  **Additional Resources**  Before applying for flair, we encourage you to check out these resources to help you with the application process:  * Our Rules Roundtable on 'Expertise' and the Flair Application Process * Our Wiki Guide on what makes a good application * The Previous Application Threads, to see what makes for successful - and not successful - applications.  * The Sunday Digest, and Monthly Awards which can provide many examples of we are looking for regarding the caliber of flaired users."}}
{"item": {"input": "What is it like to leave academia? I get the sense that most of this sub is geared toward university PhD professors/post-docs/grad students so I am in a little bit of a different position but I think a lot of the same values, positives, and negatives of academia apply so I am looking for any thoughts from similarly  academically-minded people.  &#x200B;  I am currently finishing my medical residency (rough equivalent of post-doc). Like many of you, I have been in academia my whole life and been rewarded so far with opportunities, praise, respect, grants, etc. But I am at a career crossroads now that I have to get my first \"real\" job. The two jobs are probably more similar than they are different in the grand scheme of things given that my main role will be seeing patients either way. The main differences are the environment, autonomy, and pay.   &#x200B;  The two jobs:  \\--Academic job: 20-30% research time, 70% seeing patients, teaching, and administrative duties. Somewhat more flexible lifestyle due to culture and slower pace (45-50 hours/week). Pay starts at 300k/year and may rise slowly over the next 10-15 years. I am lukewarm about my research but could continue it. The main benefit is getting to stay in an intellectually engaging environment at a top institution for my field, and one where I am comfortable having been in the academic environment for almost 20 years.   \\--Private job: 100% seeing patients every day, can be a bit of a grind (55-60 hours/week). Pay starts higher (maybe 400-450k/year) and will rise quickly for 2 years to 600-800k/year, and then slowly rise after that as I get more efficient over time and/or with inflation.  Main benefit is the money, lack of having research projects hang over my head (and having to bring work home with me). Possible downsides are missing the intellectual side of academia and the longer-term outlook that comes with research (i.e. every day/week/month is going to be the same in broad strokes, I'll be doing the same thing in August 2030 as I am in August 2020).   &#x200B;  Has anyone on this sub left academia after years of being in academia and succeeding at it? I feel like I may be throwing away an opportunity that so many want and so few get."}}
