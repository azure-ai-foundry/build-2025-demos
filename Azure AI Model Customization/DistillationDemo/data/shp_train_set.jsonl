{"prompt": "Conducted my first lecture today. It did not go well I\u2019m a TA and this term I am conducting classes for one of the intro lectures for first years. It\u2019s like a general knowledge module on my country (so we cover history, econ, politics etc).   I had my first independent lecture today on a topic I\u2019m not familiar with at all. And it was so bad. I couldn\u2019t pronounce a few names (it was on the origin of our language), my explanations were all over the place and I couldn\u2019t answer a question a student had (I did answer it later though). I found out the topic yesterday so I didn\u2019t have enough time to prepare.   I\u2019m not sure how to deal with this. This was their first impression of me and I\u2019m a little worried that I\u2019ll make things worse for them.   Was anyone ever in a similar situation? How do I recover from this?", "completion": "I just finished my PhD in curriculum studies, and have continued teaching high school during grad school. When I became a teacher 15 years ago, it was through an accelerated process, that involved a ton of mentoring during my first year of teaching.  One of my mentors mentioned, kind of off-handedly, that it was somewhere around his 7th year of teaching the same, narrow subject (chemistry, in his case) that he was able to walk into the room and teach pretty well, without doing several hours of prep for each hour of class.   As others have said above, you were put into an unreasonable position, because you didn't have time to prep. Hopefully, you know (or have control over) the content of the second class, and can put the prep in.   There's lots of good advice above (even though the suggestions move in several very different directions) on how to address day 1. Pick the one that most appeals to you, and include it as part of how you prepare for the second class.   I'll just add to that advice: It's okay to tell your students that you weren't given enough time to prep the first class, and you have prepared much more thoroughly for the second. That can help your students reconcile the different experiences, if they were concerned about your trustworthiness as a TA after that first class, and to recognize that you're better than that first impression might have left."}

{"prompt": "Does diabetes (or a high PH level) cause your body to excrete pharmaceutical drugs in your urine faster than a normal, healthy individual? I had a recent urine test and failed to show any of the medication that should have been present (I had last taken it 30 hours earlier but the internet says it usually stays detectable 48-98 hours.)  Just wondering if a high acidity level in my blood/urine or diabetes itself could cause the medication to excretes faster than normal.", "completion": "Hi pharmacist here.  To put it simply, a medication's pharmacokinetic profile is made up of: absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME for short). These four factors determine the concentration of drug in the body.  In the case of methadone (a med that can last 48-98 hours in the body like your example)  it has such variable ADME that any changes to the medication regimen has to be done under close supervision.  Diabetes, depending on its disease progression and complications of the disease can affect Absorption (changes in blood flow through microvascular damage), Distribution (changes in protein concentration in the blood that binds to protein), and Excretion (nephropathy, or damage to the kidneys).  Because of these effects, methadone is difficult to use in patients with uncontrolled diabetes. If the drug you are talking about is methadone its completely possible that it is undetectable in 30 hours however since it  largely depends on your past medical history only your doctor can say for sure."}

{"prompt": "What causes diarrhea? Specifically why and how is a virus causing the body to expel massive amounts of water? Im in pain, distract me with science", "completion": "There are 4 mechanisms of diarrhea. Osmotic, permeability increased, secreting and abnormal motility (peristaltic)  * Osmotic, you have non absorbable substances that impides water to be absorbed and/or causes water to be transfered to the intestine.    * Artificial swetteners can cause this type of diarrhea (they can't be absorbed, that's why they don't have calories), as well as exocrine pancreatic insuficiency (can't digest fats, that draw water in). * Increased permeability, means that the intestine, instead of being a semiosmotic barrier as always, becomes more permeable in some way. This is the case in some inflamations and some circulatory diseases with high hidrostatic pressure and transudation.    * This is basically an edema. The body fighting the infection, increases the vascularity to the zone (more blood flows there), and with some mechanisms, allows electrolytes to go into the lumen. * Secreting. Normally, the intestine absorbs more (through the villi/mountains) than it secretes through the crypts/valleys (it has that shape in order to maximize absorption). If it doesn't, you are adding oil to a fire.    * Simple way, if an infection targets the crypts and makes them multiply and continue secreting, it will increase the amount of stuff in the intestine. Or, if it destroys the villi and doesn't absorb, but I guess that would be more akin to osmotic, although they are all conected. * Peristaltic, instead of having a slow digestion to process everything and absorb all, including water, in an infection your gut goes, \"there's something wrong, emergency evacuation\" floors the gas pedal, and you drop what you eat as a mishmash that couldn't have time to be absorbed.    * A day to day example is the difference between eating a lot of fruit \\[fiber and water and sugars\\] and red meat \\[proteins and hard to digest fats\\]. Also, this motility is the reason why bunnies eat their feces the first time the excrete them, because they can't digest them completely the first time around. (the more you know)    * (Aclaration: fiber is important for a good digestion. It was the most \"extreme normal example\" I could think of). Fiber attracts water and accelerates the digestion, being \"diarrhea-like\", whilst lots of fat, are hard to digest and slow digestion, being \"constipation-like\". Thus, eating only lettuce, would lead to a diarrhea like poop. Also, the peristaltic mechanism is often secondary to other processes.)  All of them can coexist, and in an inflammation, they usually do, but those are the mechanisms of diarrhea.  TLDR:  Specifically in regards to the virus, it probably will replicate in enterocytes (or some other intestinal cell depending on the virus). It will cause damage there, (decreasing the amount absorbed increasing osmotic pressure if it is in enterocytes \\[point 1\\]) and inflamation, increasing blood flow. This will increase the peristaltism \\[point 4\\]. In response to the infection, the immune system will respond secreting immunoglobulines and some other things point 3\\] and it will probably have some damage in the cells that will cause a \"leakage\" \\[point 2\\]. As there is more stuff in the lumen, that won't be absorbed (virus, inmunoglobulines...) there will be an increased osmotic pressure \\[point 1\\].  Edits:  1. Changed \"types\" for \"mechanisms\" it's more accurate. 2. Aclaration for the fiber part, didn't explain myself too well. 3. Some small changes to ortography and the like 4. Also. Wow, so many votes... And questions. Think I answered most if not all of them."}

I have a dashcam that plugs into a USB port for power and after getting the car back, found that it had been unplugged. After reviewing footage I found that they did a piss-poor recreation of what I told them were the conditions it could be initiated, the tech said nothing was wrong, the car was pulled into their car wash for an end-of-service cleaning, the dashcam was unplugged and then 2 miles were put on the clock.  I drive a sports car and besides insurance purposes, I like having the cam to see what the mechanics do to my car. I don't begrudge them a fun test drive, but I want to make sure they aren't abusing it either.  Any legitimate reason they would have unplugged this before I get more annoyed than I currently am? For clarification I do not believe they ran a diagnostic using an OBD reader if that has any bearing on plugged in items or power.", "completion": "No technical or diagnostic reason that I can think of.

I do work with multiple embedded engineers, which means that we are working closely during bring-up, but being remote hasn't hampered that effort.

{"prompt": "CMV: I don't think people, banks, countries, etc. have a moral obligation to repay loans given to them with the expectation of profit to the lender if they are willing to accept the consequences. Banks provide loans for other entities with the expectation that they will profit from the interest on those loans.  They are not lending the money as a favour or to help the other entity.  Another important assumption is that it is in all parties' best interest for the lendee to keep paying the loans and the lender to not call the loan.  Therefore it is the bank's responsibility to assess and independently verify the lendee's situation to verify these assumptions.  The degree of verification depends on the amount of money and other factors and may include viewing paystubs, audits and other due diligence, etc.  Based on the above factors and assumptions, the lender determines the interest rate, penalties for not paying, etc. and creates a contract.  Once signed this is a business contract like any other.  If later on the lendee determines the \"default\" option in the contract is more favorable than continuing to pay, this is a perfectly reasonable business choice and would be no different than paying a contractor an early termination fee to get out of a contract with them.

Compare, for instance, the terms that residential mortgages get versus commercial mortgages.  They're essentially the same sort of loan, but residential mortgages get lower rates, longer terms, and lower downpayments.  And that's in substantial part because people feel more of a moral obligation to pay their debts, whereas businesses operate on the more ruthless set of principles you espouse.    In a Kantian categorical imperative morality, the principle of ruthless default you propose is non-universalizable.

No, I have never calculated a triple integral in spherical coordinates, or solved a partial differential equation using a Jacobean Matrix, or calculated heat transfer through an airplane wing.  But those classes were all carriers for a whole lot of other information and skills that may not be directly understood at the time.

People look for that beautiful end product because it tastes better with a properly laminated dough. Not saying it tastes *bad* when you don't get it right (speaking from experience here), just not as good.  Other times, like with decorated cakes, I totally agree with you. Often the kind of structure you need to support an elaborately decorated cake doesn't make for a really delicious cake.  Often it's somewhere in the middle. If you've got a cheesecake that has a crack in it, it's still probably just as good as one that doesn't, but the kinds of problems that lead to the crack can also lead to other issues that do affect the end result."}

They've actually unplugged my car in order to plug in theirs on a couple of occasions.  Of course, this uses my power, but also prevents me from charging my own car, which has caused problems. I went over and asked them to stop using my power, and they were extremely rude and said that it was included in their lease, and that their landlord told them it was included in the property.  Talking to them has been completely useless. In fact, when I unplugged their car and plugged in my own, they came over and banged on the door, threatening to sue me. I haven't been able to get in touch with their landlord. The third or fourth time I found them charging their car on my plug, I called the police, who told me that this was a civil matter, and wouldn't intervene.  What can I do, at this point, to stop them from using my charger?  This is in Indiana.", "completion": "Send a certified letter to the tenant demanding they stop using the charger. It is not included in their lease as you own the charger. If they continue to use it call the police for every instance.  Also consider a dash camera that can be activated without having you drive the car.  Installing cameras around your house would be good and have one pointed at the car charging area. Everytime they unplug your car you will have evidence."}
{"prompt": "My mom went to a hospital because she couldn\u2019t walk. She was walking fine the day before this. They sent her away. I sent my mom via ambulance to another hospital, they admitted her, ran test and x rays, found out she broke her hip. Replaced her hip and 23 days later discharged her. My mom is a dialysis patient. She has been on dialysis for almost two years. She also does have neuropathy which causes her legs to jump and causes pain. She takes medication for the neuropathy so they don\u2019t hurt or jump. She lives my herself, she has two dogs, runs all her own errands, goes to dialysis three times a week. She is fully independent. So When my mom went to the first hospital she was taken via ambulance, they kept her waiting for hours on the stretcher in the hallway. When they found a room for her to be examined in she explained to them she couldn\u2019t walk and she was walking yesterday. She was also a little fuzzy and not making sense about things which was a huge red flag for me. I have brought her to the hospital a few times before and she has always been admitted. I feel liked I know my mom well so if I am concerned, she needs to go to the hospital. The doctor came in to see her, she couldn\u2019t walk and she was crying in pain. The doctor said it\u2019s just neuropathy and swelling from dialysis. They discharged her. I brought her to my house. She could not walk so I was freaking out. Called her doctors. They said go to a different hospital immediately. So I called an ambulance and sent her to the other hospital the doctor suggested. The second hospital admitted her. After doing test and xrays, they found a broken hip, a bacteria resistant uti, and she was swollen from fluid overload. They said she was high risk for becoming septic so they immediately started trying to get her better. After 22-23 days in the hospital, they replaced her hip and got rid of the infection. She is now in a rehabilitation program inpatient to get her back to where she was, taking care of herself 100%. She is doing really well! Should I go back to the hospital who did not help her and raise hell? Or should I move forward. I feel I am too close to the situation to make the right decision. I want to cuss them all out and sue them. It\u2019s my mom though so I feel I may be over reacting!", "completion": "So not sure what part of Alabama you are in, but there\u2019s a rather large hospital that has been dealing with ALOT of backlash from being pitifully subpar.

{"prompt": "How physicist come up with equations Math is very important in physics. So I wonder how are physicists able to come up with equations to describe there theories.", "completion": "There are kinda two paths:  ----  The experimental path:  Zeroth: determine that two things are even related at all.  Sounds obvious, but is arguably the most important step.  First: get a bunch of data for how thing A varies with thing B.  Second: come up with the simplest mathematical expression that fits that data.  Third: come up with a physical reason why that mathematical expression actually makes sense.  If it doesn't, go back to step 2 and try to come up with something that does.  ------  The theoretical path:  Take existing equations from various places, smush them together, and consider if there are any interesting implications due to this hybrid combination.  Corollary: this can be done with \"Maybe X works like Y\" assumptions.  You assume it's true, do your combining and manipulating, and see if anything neat happens.  If you produce an impossible result, you've proved that X does *not* work like Y.  If you produce an interesting result, perhaps someone can test it experimentally.  If you produce something that's true, than maybe X does work like Y.  -----  If you look historically, the experimental path produces some weird -- and often wrong or incomplete -- answers.  However, as more data comes in, more variables are explored, the exact relations become better understood.  If you look at elecromagnetics, there are around a half-dozen different named laws, discovered and refined over roughly a hundred years.  It starts with the behavior of statically charged objects, then there are discoveries that electrical current produces magnetic fields, and so on -- until finally it was all summarized in Maxwell's Equations.  Except that even those have been restated, and the modern form in which they are written is \"friendlier\" than Maxwell's original publication.  And also they've been improved and corrected by adding relativistic versions, etc."}

{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old: How come we can't just add X amount of gears to a transmission and have one of the most efficient cars ever?", "completion": "We kinda did. Early cars had 3 speeds, and now we have 10. We also have CVTs with infinite ratios. At the end of the day it won't help much. Adding more gears would make it possible to go faster while maintaining low engine rpm but at some point air will make it too difficult to reach those speeds with such low engine output. You could design those gears to be used at lower speeds to keep the engine in its efficiency zone but then your gearbox would need to constantly shift gears. Even 10 is too much really and it's often annoying to drive. And even with infinite ratios CVTs are only slightly more efficient so there's not much to be gained anyway."}

Is there anything I can add at this point to fix this?", "completion": "I don't know much about curry but I do know acids neutralize salt flavor so maybe add some acid that suits the flavor. I would generally use lime or apple cider vinegar but whatever acid you think would match flavor-wise, might help neutralize the salt flavor!"}

How long should our meeting times last?   I don't want to come off rude by proposing a meeting schedule that's too much commitment for her, but I also don't want to propose an under-average meeting schedule as this doesn't allow me to fully take advantage of the program.

{"prompt": "[NE & CO] My mom wants to have me \"repossessed\" from college and taken home by force over state lines. Can she do that? For some backstory, my mom is a very controlling and rather horrible person. She has absolutely no tolerance for my sense of privacy, and it's gotten worse since I've moved out for college. She demands access to absolutely everything I have. This will be important later.  &#x200B;  I'm 18 years old, and I'm a college freshman. I go to college in Colorado, but I was born and raised in Nebraska. In Nebraska, you aren't a legal adult until you're 19 years old. It was hell just convincing her to let me go to college, and it was much harder convincing her to let me go to college out of state. Like I said earlier, my mom is incredibly controlling and she hates it when I do things that are outside of her reach.  &#x200B;  My mom demands my passwords for everything she knows about. Email, WhatsApp, Facebook (even though I haven't used it in years), Twitter (again, relatively unused but she always checks it and bugs me about random shit that shows up on my timeline), you name it, she'll demand the password for it and threaten me with grounding and \"a good spankin'\" if I don't give it to her. In the past, I've rolled over and taken it. It was a survival mechanism more than anything. If I'd stood up to her then, there's no way she would have let me go to college. She justifies this by claiming that because I have autism, I can't tell what's right and wrong and need to be monitored.  &#x200B;  About a month ago, I changed all my passwords. Sure enough, literally less than two hours later, my mom texts me, telling me that I need to give her my new passwords. I tell her no. This is where trouble begins.  &#x200B;  Over the course of the past month, she's gotten very difficult and agitated with me, and tried to guilt me into giving her my passwords. She's tried to force her way into the accounts, with no success. Although in the last week, things have gotten even worse. A week ago, she showed up here and I had to have her escorted out by campus police after a brief verbal altercation. That pissed her off a bunch.  &#x200B;  Recently, though, as in last night, I was on a phone call with her, and she told me that she would have me \"repossessed\" by \"the goons.\" I asked her to clarify and she said that because I'm still a minor in Nebraska, and I'm a resident of Nebraska, I have to abide by Nebraska's laws and as such, I am still a minor and she can do that. I wished her good luck with that endeavor, trying to act like I wasn't fucking terrified, seeing as I've been \"gooned\" (read: taken by force to a psych ward) before. It's not nice. I do not want to be gooned and taken home. I don't want to face my mother again.  &#x200B;  So the question is this: can she do that? Is the Fugitive Slave Act not dead after all? Does my having autism change the circumstances any? If all else fails, what can I do to protect myself?", "completion": "Can you change your residency to Colorado?

{"prompt": "CMV: Legacy admissions to colleges and any other preferential treatment due to being associated with someone famous or someone that works their is unfair I mean this is not a rant.

This is especially unfair when the admissions to the college is very competitive.  It's said that 69% of students agree that legacy admissions is not fair, and 58% of legacy students say that legacy admissions are unfair.  I mean I don't see how being the song or daughter of a alumnus makes your more deserving of admittance to top institutions.  Also, some people have a higher chance to get admitted all because they have a relative or friend that works at the university. This is also not fair since it's anti-meritocratic in a situation that's supposed to be meritocratic.", "completion": "Hypothetically, legacy admissions may be a benefit to the other students attending that school, not just to the legacy students themselves. Primarily, these benefits are in terms of donations to the school which benefit all students, as well as networking opportunities that the other students otherwise would not get.

The lease was obviously pulled from a form and seemed standard.  There is a clause in the lease which states that I can't install curtains rods or hooks.  This seemed standard as well, I had similar at my old apartment.  I assumed there would be some sort of curtain provided, and this was in regards to additional curtains.  I moved in Sunday, and found the landlord had not installed curtains at all.  At this point, I assumed the issue with curtains was the potential to damage to the wall.  So, I bought tension rods that require no hardware and used them to hang curtains.  Monday afternoon I got a text from my landlord saying I needed to remove the curtains.  The building is on a street corner with a fair amount of foot traffic.  Between the four windows, you can see all of my apartment with the exception of the portion of the bathroom with the toilet and tub.  Not only does this mean I have no privacy, but the neighborhood is slightly sketchy after dark.  The nearby buildings have bars on their windows.  Anyone passing by not only can see my possessions, but whether or not I am home.  I expressed this to the landlord in my reply over text.  He replied to reread my lease.  I left them up overnight.  I had orientation this morning and came back to find the curtains removed and no where in the apartment.  I discovered this before entering the building, as two guys were outside one of my windows and looking in my apartment.  They left when I entered the building.  I messaged the landlord saying he didn't have the right to enter the apartment and asked for the curtains back.  He again said to check my lease and then commented that I needed to finish unpacking as it looked messy in my apartment.  I had to head to a work event so I couldn't follow through more, but I moved my electronics to one corner and used a bookshelf to block one of the windows so they weren't visible.  While at the event, I got a text from the landlord with a picture of the blocked window, captioned \"whatts this\"  What can I do to prevent my landlord from entering the apartment unannounced and to compel him to allow some form of curtain?  Alternatively, how do I break my lease three days into it?  This is too crazy for week one.", "completion": "Look into tenancy law in Baltimore and find out whether or not you can apply to break the lease based on him entering your apartment without giving notice. I think you are in danger.  I'm guessing you're female? This is throwing up so many red flags. Speculation: The landlord was probably planning to find a female and forbid her to install curtains before he even met you. He might want to watch you from a distance, maybe gets off on the idea of the helplessness you feel over having been stripped of privacy and maybe gets off on the idea of other people watching you. He's making changes to your life in controlling you in ways which you fundamentally disagree with; it's damaging your well-being. That's what psychopaths yearn to do. He will act innocent no matter how bad things get. Don't accuse him of anything when you correspond with him; he will turn accusations into statements which won't seem right while you can't place why. And they will be totally avoiding the problem in the first place. They will confuse you. Nightmarish \"mindfucks\".  He's mocking you. \"whatts this\"- he's not playing dumb, he's straight up mocking you. Seems like sarcasm, which given the circumstances is extremely inappropriate..  He may be a psychopath. Quite possibly a pervert.  Don't act frustrated. Don't act any way out of the ordinary. Be neutral towards this situation, if not happy. Otherwise you're going to open up new options for him to harass you. And he will leave you with an experience you have to recover from.  Where I live, landlords have to give written notice 24h (I think) prior to entering a tenants apartment. Violating that is grounds for terminating a lease, which you can apply to do while submitting evidence the infraction took place. Screenshots of the texts talking about him removing the curtains and him talking about what it looks like in your place may or may not constitute evidence. Depends on how exactly they are worded. If it's unclear he entered your apartment to remove them, he could just say he saw your place through the window and that's how he knows it looks messy (whether or not that's true- again, he's just playing with you like a psychopath would)."}
{"prompt": "CMV: Most 'back in my day' type statements are worth listening to, particularly when made by people who are older than us, and it is okay to admit we don't know better than them in a lot of cases. I accept that this could be a flawed view, but I think most people need to stop being so self-righteous and just accept older people often do have better advice because they have had more time to be wrong and make mistakes and then find better ways to deal with them than younger people have. There are a surprising amount of things that can be true for multiple generations' experiences, so 'back in my day' is completely appropriate way to preface advice for those kind of things. Why is it such a controversial buzzword and why are we so afraid to be proven wrong? If anyone can give me a convincing argument as to why we should devalue advice given by older generations to younger ones, then please let me know because I genuinely don't know them but I want to.", "completion": "It *is* good to admit when you don't know better than someone else. The problem with the stereotypical use of the phrase \"back in my day\" is that it's the exact opposite. When I have heard it, it has often been said by a non-expert objecting to the consensus of experts.  A good example that periodically goes around on Facebook is \"back in my day, kids rode around in the bed of pickup trucks and we turned out ok.\" The problem with this is that it comes from someone who obviously hasn't read statistics on traffic fatalities, so they're not experts on traffic safety. Someone who understood the impacts on the human body of seatbelts and airbags vs. direct impact to the metal truck frame or the asphalt pavement also wouldn't share a meme like that.   Because these people are relying on their own anecdotal experience rather than expert data, they are stating something ridiculous that is colored by survivorship bias, among other fallacies.  If an old person has a valid argument, in my experience, they will use it. Saying, \"I'm old, trust me, I know better\" is a defense used to protect an opinion that they don't have a good argument for."}

I had my results back from this test which showed I *DO* have some reflux, but I wasn\u2019t experiencing reflux when I was vomiting, or the pain I was recording wasn\u2019t showing as reflux either..? My doctor has said to me that because of this, if I was to be referred to the surgeons they could reject me as it\u2019s not solid evidence of this being reflux and being treatable from surgery which I\u2019m so upset about... My doctor has now referred me for another endoscopy camera to go down with biopsy\u2019s (I had an endoscopy 6 years ago which showed nothing) to hope they can see evidence of what\u2019s going on.. but this won\u2019t happen for a while now because they\u2019ve stopped all surgeries and endoscopys during COVID unless it\u2019s an emergency, and there\u2019s a long waiting list... the doctor said to me I would have to become severely underweight or unwell in order for me to become an emergency...

If a human organization ever colonizes mars, over time this colony is all but guaranteed to rebel. The vast distances and time involved with travelling to Mars and the material conditions that the people who live there will face will lead, inevitably, to martian culture diverging from its source culture.

I think this is the most likely consequence of the physical realities of a martian colonization because of the history of colonization on earth.

I also work with the CDC Healthy Contact Lens Program to help people learn about contact lens-related eye infections and the healthy habits that can reduce your chances of getting an eye infection. For more information about the CDC Healthy Contact Lens Program and our contact lens recommendations, visit our website: https://www.cdc.gov/contactlenses/index.html.  My team conducted new research on the communication between eye care providers and patients on contact health. Read the new MMWR report here: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6832a2.htm.

{"prompt": "Weekly discussion - Cooking for one and dining alone With Valentines behind us, let's leave the happy couples behind for a little while. How do you keep up your enthusiasm for cooking when you're only cooking for yourself? Do you make big batches and eat the same thing for a week or freeze portions for later? Or do you just keep things simple until you have someone to cook for?  How do you deal with eating out alone? I understand for some this is quite a challenge. Do you people-watch? Bring a book? Have you become a regular and developed a relationship with the staff for some camaraderie?", "completion": "I cook for 2.5 now but I would like to give a perspective of what I wished I had done.  Learn to break down chickens. There is so much variety in what you can do in a whole chicken. Every Sunday I take 1-3 chickens and break them down to breast, thighs, legs, wings, and carcass. Carcass goes in freezer and I make stock. Wings can go in freezer until I have enough to fry up. I meal plan around the rest. Whole chicken can be found in butcher cases for about $1/lb and will be better quality.  I wish I had a lot more variety. When I started picking up cook books (like Cooks Illustrated) I started getting more ideas what to do with different cuts. This means I can buy a 3lb pork butt and get more than pulled pork out of it. Same for chuck roasts. These days I try to rotate evenly across meats and cuts to keep the variety up, before I just got huge chunks of cheap meat and got burned out quick eating the same meal for 5 days.  I bought an instant pot. Honestly I could have gotten away with less pots and pans but having the instant pot opens up a ton of doors for doing braises really fast. I could have also looked more into beans and rice dishes had I had one. Cheap meals take a long time to cook so cutting that by a third would have made it practical.  Really could have focused more on vegetables, learning about different ones and figuring out how to cook them. One thing I learned about when I met my wife is she had a CSA, which means she pays $/mo and picks up a box of produce. That forced her to try things like swiss chard. Sometimes I pick an ingredient I never used, look up what to make, and buy it. Chard is a good example, because I went from not knowing what it was to having it a weekly rotation, it's very versatile. Having broader vegetable horizons mean more variety in food, and I can pick ones that last a few days and ones that last a couple weeks and have plenty stocked at all time, vs buying vegetables that just rot and get thrown away.  I make a balanced diet of 1 part meat, 1 part starch, 2 part vegetable these days. So learning to cook a lot of starches helps variety too. I cycle through potato, pasta, rice, polenta, and beans.  Lunches are just going to be routine. It really comes down to soups, salads, sandwiches, and sometimes leftovers. Tacos are a good one for using leftover meat, enchiladas by extension too.  Also there are some things that really are just not worth making at home, especially frying because it doesn't scale well on individual levels unless you do it pretty often. Even some stuff like burgers where I go all out and make fries, it seems to end up a messy ordeal.  Really it just comes down to I wish I had put more effort into variety vs nerding out on techniques. I wish I just went slower and focused less on steaks and more on braises (for example).  All this really would have helped me eat a lot more cheap and waste less food. I wasted so much money eating unhealthy food."}
{"prompt": "CMV: We should return to the 94% income tax for every dollar over 2M (adjusted for inflation). In 1944 the top tax was 94% for every dollar over $200,000 (2M in today's money.)  *Employee* salaries and business expenses for expansion would be tax exempt money.  Someone making $1B a year would still make $59,880,000.  For every 1 million over 2 million they'd make 60K on. That's plenty.  Going overseas to avoid the tax should result in seizing of assets and removal of citizenship.  The Socialism bad people fail to realise that it would have given the government T1.768 in income tax just off the billionaires. still leaving them $120B poor them :(  We need to start using wealth gained to help everyone and not just let the rich few get wealth they will never be able to use.", "completion": "Ok to start with, whenever you lead with \u201ctrying to leave should result in loss of citizenship and assets\u201d, you are going full on communist, read up on how that worked out.

The reality is that laws take time, and when California started talking about a wealth tax that followed you for ten years after you left, Elon Musk pulled the ejection handle and moved himself and much of Tesla to Texas.  So know this, if such a law were even discussed seriously, Musk, Bezos, Gates and many others love somewhere else overnight. You are talking about the most mobile people in the world, they can live anywhere they want. They wouldn\u2019t let you steal 94% of their income or their wealth.  Second, income is taxed, not wealth. Wealth isn\u2019t taxed until realized, and if this law were seriously considered, you would cause the largest sell off of wealth in history. You would manufacture a new Great Depression, and the government would have less money.  So let\u2019s say you don\u2019t want to wait for changing the law, because people can leave and you can\u2019t stop them, well now you are into revolution, because you can\u2019t just force it to be your way. When governments get stupid, people leave, which is why France let go of their brief and moronic wealth tax so quickly. Other countries literally advertised their tax policies to France\u2019s wealthy.   And forgetting all of that, you can only steal that wealth once, then it is gone. Let\u2019s say you amend this to be wealth theft, where the money is, there is no more after it happens. If you could do it, nobody would build wealth like that again until you were gone, and it wouldn\u2019t take long for you to be gone.  And then, on top of that, you would be doing long term economic damage and destroying future revenue for a one time gain of $1.7 trillion?

{"prompt": "CMV: People who are against an extensive welfare/social program because they won\u2019t benefit from it are selfish and not very bright.  Generally speaking, I don\u2019t think highly of most people who are against welfare/social programs, but the argument that makes the least sense to me is the \u201cmy money shouldn\u2019t go towards something that doesn\u2019t benefit me/I shouldn\u2019t have to pay more for someone else to get xy\u201d.  For the sake of this argument let\u2019s ignore that helping the less fortunate has a positive effect on society and thus benefits all members as they clearly don\u2019t believe that.  According to the dictionary, selfish means \u201clacking consideration for other people; concerned chiefly with one's own personal profit or pleasure\u201d, so I think it\u2019s pretty clear that the people who think along these lines are selfish.  I also think that they are not the smartest either, as a selfish but logical person would see that the best option for them is to have the security of an available and accessible welfare network even if they won\u2019t need it. Let\u2019s look at the options:  A. *There is no welfare system in place and you would\u2019ve needed it.* Clearly a bad situation.  B. *There is no welfare system in place and you never end up needing it.* Congratulations, you were lucky. However, you lived your life knowing that your luck might not hold and you\u2019re just one unexpected event away from being in a situation where you could have benefited from a safety net. You had an accident/got sick and now you\u2019re disabled/can\u2019t work? Too bad. You found out you\u2019re pregnant but can\u2019t afford to raise the child as a single parent? Tough luck. You were on a family trip, got in a car crash, and now your child is an orphan? Sucks to be them. There was an earthquake and everything you own is destroyed? Hope you don\u2019t mind.  C. *There is a welfare system in place and you end up needing it.* It\u2019s great that there was help available but it sucks that you fell on hard times. Not an ideal situation.  D. *There is a welfare system in place and you never end up needing it.* Most ideal situation. You lived a relatively comfortable life with the added reassurance that, were something to change, you wouldn\u2019t be on your own.  **Thus, my view is that on top of being selfish, they are not the smartest either as, all other things being equal, having the safety net of social welfare and not needing it is the best/most logical option.**  Ideally, I would like my view changed on both aspects, but proving that they are either not selfish or smart is also ok.  Arguments that I heard before/won\u2019t change my mind:  *People are responsible for their own lives/they should have prepared/they should have been more responsible/etc*. I\u2019m not talking about rich people who can fall back on their money/their family\u2019s money. In reality, most average people are one tragedy away from homelessness/poverty/hardship. I wish I could find that reddit post where the guy was explaining how it took 5 months after his wife\u2019s cancer diagnosis to lose 20 years' worth of savings and to have to remortgage their home. Basically, you can do everything right and still find yourself in a difficult position.  *There is/could be an option E in which such systems/programs are not needed to begin with.* I don\u2019t think that\u2019s plausible.  *Option B is preferable over D for said people because the possibility of their own misfortune bothers them less than the idea of someone else benefiting from their taxes.* This just proves that they are selfish and dumb for thinking that it\u2019s a good idea to sink the ship they are on just so the captain drowns.  *Option B is the best for them because they are not worried/they don\u2019t think it possible that they could be in the shoes of the less fortunate.* That just shows a total lack of empathy and awareness, assuming that just because they don\u2019t need it now, they\u2019ll never need it in the future proves they are not smart.  I also would prefer it, if your argument wouldn\u2019t be over semantics.

The 'stupid' element though is a changeable view.   > a selfish but logical person would see that the best option for them is to have the security of an available and accessible welfare network even if they won\u2019t need it.  This is ignoring the cost of that security. It is like saying anyone who doesn't have insurance is stupid' when they might assess it as the cost of paying a monthly premium for a service they are unlikely to need is not worth the potential payout. That they would be better saving their money to cover an unexpected cost than paying for something that might not happen. I dont pay for phone insurance- I dont consider the cost/benefit worth it. Whether you agree or not that isn't an implicitly stupid stance to take.   When viewing this issue purely selfishly' it is an issue of risk analysis and cost/benefit. Someone in a secure position may not consider protecting against a low risk worth the cost. Using your examples' in scenario B/D their assessment was correct and purely selfishly they were correct to not want to finance a welfare system they didn't use. If you consider the peace of mind D has better than the lack of expense B has that's a valid stance' but I would not dismiss someone as stupid for valuing thw lower cost over peace of mind."}

Baking soda changes the Ph level of the water and will soften the outer skin to allow the bean to absorb more water, thus making a softer final product.

It pains me to suggest this, but is it possible that you have been duped by a scam \u201claboratory\u201d? I ask because I have done some research on the company you mentioned in your other post, and I found several red flags. Did you go to a physical location to provide a sample, or did you have to send one?  Specifically, the company never mentions anything about test methods, techniques, equipment, or key personnel on their website. It does, however, have a lot of the hallmarks of companies that claim to provide hair analysis, nutritional analysis, and other testing in the \u201cwoo\u201d health industry; such companies are suspected of providing fake test results to unsuspecting customers, who then use the information to make real medical decisions. For example, the page of testimonials that only mention first names is a hallmark of the woo companies. There\u2019s also no mention of accreditation of their laboratory by any forensic testing agency, and I could not find the company mentioned in any websites that they had not created themselves.   I looked for the company\u2019s employees or former employees in LinkedIn and didn\u2019t find a single profile mentioning the company. The company itself does have a profile, but the content is limited to a mirror of their Facebook profile, which included testimonials from people that don\u2019t seem to really exist on Facebook. I also checked Glassdoor, and they didn\u2019t have a profile there either. I was unable to find any information about the company\u2019s ownership. It\u2019s almost as if they don\u2019t exist.  I also had specific concerns about the report you were provided and the chain of custody, which is what lead me to start searching in the first place. Chain of custody is a laboratory as well as legal term, and there are very strict requirements regarding how samples are taken and handled. I was also suspicious of the website\u2019s offer of a person to testify in a trial if needed. That\u2019s not something that would be brought up in a website of a legitimate testing company.   Finally, I\u2019m a chemist by profession, as well as a bit of a chemical element nerd. One doctor mentioned that there are natural explanations for most of the high readings, which is true, but what are the odds of having all of the high values? You would have to have over 10 individual high exposures. For example, taking PeptoBismol and having depleted calcium and high levels of lithium in your water and exposure to heavy metals like chromium from manufacturing and, and, and many fold over. I even entertained art sources, since several of the high levels can be linked to paint pigments. For someone to intentionally expose you intentionally to all of those elements would be extraordinarily difficult, especially for a lay person. Even as a chemist, I\u2019ve never seen all of those elements in one place, except maybe a university lab.   If you\u2019d like more specific information, feel free to private message me.

{"prompt": "Is the radial centrifugal force being experienced by a section of a flywheel rim the same as the total radial force for the entire rim? Hi, I\u2019m having a disagreement with someone and wondered if you could confirm this.   Say you have a rotating hoop, such as a flywheel rim. This rim has mass 100kg and circumference 100cm. At its rotational speed the sum of all radial forces is 200N.  My contention is that each cm of rim is contributing/experiencing 2N to/of the overall radial force.  His contention in the the above example would be that every point in this rim would be experiencing 200N radial force, irrespective of how small that point is. He thinks that because the tangential (hoop stress) force is the same at any point around the circumference, then radial force must also be the same at every point (ie 1cm of that rim would be experiencing 200N of radial force).  All of this is ignoring vector quantities, only looking at the radial (apparent) force acting away from the axis of rotation (within the non inertial reference frame).

{"prompt": "Cmv: voter ID laws aren't racist People keep saying that. But identification is really easy to get. Not only that, but you have to have an ID for most things. And if you ask most minorities, they have id.  You have to have an ID for most things anyway! Buying booze, buying weed, buying cigs. getting a job, investing. All of it requires ID.   You need an Id to do most things. And getting a birth certificate is like 25 bucks, it's really not hard at all to get one. You drop into a registry, pay a fee and get an ID.  If a person doesn't work or contribute to the economy by buying products, or is too lazy to get an ID, why should they be able to vote?    And if large swaths of people of a specific racial group doesn't have I'd when they do have easy access to it. Doesn't that point out a fundamental problem with their culture more then racist policies?  Or maybe it's because I'm not American and your system is backwards as hell?   I honestly don't think that people without proper education should be allowed to vote at all, no matter the race.  But that's just my opinion with the fundamental problems with democracy more then anything else.  I'm literally considered lower class, if it wasn't for living with 3 roommates I'd literally be living on the streets. I live in a ghetto, and I can literally walk for 20 minutes to go to the registry and get an id for 25 dollars.   I'm just saying their is a fundamental problem with black culture in the united states. It's a culture of perpetual victimhood. I mean, you can't blame them for it. They were taken from their ancestral homeland and forced to destroy their own culture. So they had to build it from the ground up.  At least other oppressed minorities had that sort of cultural background to hold on to. Like asians and natives. African Americans literally had nothing.   But if you see the way that many people who subscribe to the \"mainstream gangsta\" (I'm saying that with BIG AIRQUOTES here because many if not most black people don't) act. It's centered around materialism, victimhood, and objectification of woman. You cannot deny that it's a huge issue the black community has.    Then you take a look at people like: Madam C.J. Walker and Mary Ellen Pleasant. Who were born literally as slaves, and died millionaires. Showing that even when america was at it's worst, a black person could still reach great heights with the proper attitude, working smart (not hard) and understanding their strengths.    To be frank, the only real way to solve poverty is economic education and getting rid of the victim culture that plagues many communities. Because no matter how much you help them. If the people don't have the mindset of success, then they will never succeed.", "completion": "> But identification is really easy to get.

You don't see scientific terms losing meaning because of vast misuse very often yet pop-culture slang evolves over time and never really maintains a consistent definition from beginning to end.

{"prompt": "Is attending pastry school after graduating with a Bachelor's degree wasteful? I am going to be graduating with a Bachelor's degree in anthropology this spring. I really love academia and have applied to two graduate programs that I will be very happy to attend should I be accepted. However, they are very competitive programs and I am not bating my breath. I have been baking at home since I was 12 and have worked in restaurants for 6 years now, and have been the head baker at a coffeeshop with a decent assortment of pastries for about a year. Despite all my baking at work, I still bake constantly at home as it is truly one of my favorite things in the world.   Would I be \"wasting\" my bachelor's degree if I were to attend a pastry school after graduating? Even though I love the idea of attaining a proper education so I can pursue pastry further (and hopefully own & operate my own micro-bakery down the line), I can't help but feel that\u2013if I ended up attending pastry school anyway\u2013then it was such a \"waste\" to attend university for four years and spend tens of thousands of dollars on it. I will never consider it a *true* waste because I value the intellectual education I received and wouldn't return it for the world. But considering the typical pay that pastry chefs earn, it feels like I would have made an investment not only in my bachelor's degree but also in pastry school to earn a salary that is accessible even to those without either of these educational experiences.   I love baking. I think about it constantly, plan on projects, consume baking content, look for inspiration, and I already know I love the actual grind of baking in a professional setting. I know this isn't a passing passion as I have been baking for many years and have always found it thrilling. Yet, I can't shake the feeling that I spent so much time and money on a degree that will not have been necessary should I pursue pastry as a career. Do y'all have any thoughts on this?

Edit: I know this is easier said than done coming from a country where tertiary education is affordable and I managed to get 2 degrees without making a financial dent.

So the cheesecake is done and it's DELICIOUS but *very* rich, to the point where I can't imagine what it would've been like if I used the full amount of sugar.  I do this a lot with cakes, tarts and muffins (what I usually make) and have never had any problems, so I do wonder why recipes contain such a high amount of sugar. I guess a follow up question would be are there any particular bakes where you absolutely need the amount of sugar specified?", "completion": "It really depends on the recipe. The function of sugar in baking adds far more than just a sweet taste. It affects the colour, spread, tenderizes, and more. Bakers ratios are important, so in a professional bakery you can't just cut amounts of sugar with reckless abandon because you feel like it lol. If you're a home baker, be aware that changing ratios can have adverse effects on your final product.   My aunt always always cuts half or more of sugar out of her cookies.

We were asked to conceptualize their struggles and empathize with their suffering, to acknowledge their humanity and their pain.  Vox beseeched liberals to listen to Trump voters' concerns. The Atlantic profiled Trump supporter after Trump supporter to dispel the conventional wisdom that they were all racist boomers or antisocial white nationalists. USA today did the same. 538 did repeated statical analysis to disprove those stereotypes. The New York Times told us to \"stop shaming Trump voters\". The Washington Post suggested we empathize with Trump voters. Hell, even the quite literally Socialist magazine Jacobin made the same request.  Meanwhile, reviews of books about rural white working class society became vehicles for left-leaning publications to ask readers to feel pity for the underserviced social sectors that became Trump voters. \"Hillbilly Elegy\" and \"Strangers In Their Own Land\", for example.  My question, then is this: Why isn't the Right held to the same standard?   Where is the Fox News op-ed about how Trump voters need to work to understand the root cause of BLM? When hasn't the Wall Street Journal ever profiled an Antifa member or a climate activist or even just a bunch of Biden voters in general? When can we expect the Washington Times to do a multipart series on how the struggles of indebted students, DREAMers and the LGBT community led them to vote Democrat?

If there's no water, there's no bacteria to spoil it. They will tend to continue aging and drying out, maybe growing a little mold where water can condense but not a lot. A chunk of parmesan can last a while. So really dry cheeses will not spoil very fast.  Cheeses have lots of living things in them, and they're cultured to grow it. These give characteristic flavors, along with the ingredients and environment. Some of these things, like the \"blue\" in blue cheeses, can kill or out-compete other organisms that want to eat it. They keep the food to themselves, and it will last quite a while. Blue cheeses tend to get more blue as they age.  Some grow protective molds on the outside. The white rind on brie protects the inside. And it's *completely alive*. If you cut out a wedge of brie and close it back up with the cut exposed, the rind will gradually seal over the missing wedge you removed.  And lastly, many other cheeses don't have much alive left in them (possibly even pasteurized or processed), or what's there cannot fight off invaders. They have enough moisture where all sorts of bread molds and random spores can take hold. These cheeses will grow hair and turn colors.  source: I cure/pickle/dry a lot of stuff and have made several cheeses"}
{"prompt": "Why some philosophers are such a difficult read? Me and a friend are interested in philosophy but we see in some texts a language barrier.   We were wondering why, for exemple, Kant, would write in such a manner it is restrictive of the number of people who can access the information. Isn't that counterproductive to the language?   Outside of literary language, what use does complex formulation have, if not to elitize the shit out of the discussion?", "completion": "Philosophers are often writing about subjects which people don't usually think about, and writing about them in a way which for sake of clarity must be very precise. They're also often responding to a particular body of literature composed of other writings, about which we can say the same. All of this produces a situation where the texts that get produced in this context are difficult to read, especially to the reader relatively unfamiliar with the relevant body of literature.  This result is neither counter-productive nor elitist, but rather a necessary consequence of writing in a technical way about difficult concepts.  It seems to me that we tend to accept this fact when dealing with other disciplines, and it's mostly only with respect to philosophy that one finds the expectation that anyone, regardless of background, should be able to pick up the most technically challenging work and still read it with the ease they're used to in casual reading. I worry that this represents some unrealistic assumptions about what philosophy is.  Anyway, it's certainly the case that some philosophers are simply not gifted writers, and it's probably the case that some philosophers deliberately write poorly due to one or another personality trait inconsistent with effective communication. But particularly the latter case is more likely the exception than the rule, and most of the challenge in reading philosophy is better explained by recognizing that it is a technical discipline."}

{"prompt": "Why have speed limits not changed, despite automotive performance & safety making progress? I\u2019ve done a fair bit of survey staking & engineering documentation in the Civil & Structural field. I also build & tune street cars as a hobby.  How is it that safety & performance of vehicles has made tremendous progress, but are still bound to 20th century regulations? You can walk onto a new car lot and buy an econo-box that will top out at 135mph. You can buy sports cars capable of 180mph and engineered to travel that safely.  If that car has the capability to reach that speed in OEM condition, wouldn\u2019t it be safe to the vehicle was engineered & tested to travel that speed? Also I understand civil engineering standards have improved. For example, SUDAS (the state I use to do surveying in) has been improved upon and new construction is held to a higher standard. So wouldn\u2019t it be considered safer?  The interstate was built in the 60\u2019s, yet the speed limit hasn\u2019t fluctuated much. My state (Montana) ran a \u201csafe & prudent\u201d speed limit up until the late 90\u2019s, but still it\u2019s 20mph faster than neighboring states.  So what\u2019s the limiting factor? Is it the standard at with we license drivers? How does the EU make it work?", "completion": "I don\u2019t know where you live, but in Europe speed limits have generally been reduced as the the fuel saving, CO2, NOX, particulates and noise reduction, decreases congestion and increased safety with respect to pedestrians and cyclists have been valued over minor decreases in personal vehicle travel time. There is data that shows that decreasing the speed limit often decreases the travel time of drivers due to smoother traffic and reduced road demand."}

She starts to get hot and anxious and suddenly has the urge to defecate. as she lays her seat down- her vision turns to black and white for like 10-20 seconds, and then she goes blind. She can hear everything, but can\u2019t see and is saying things that don\u2019t make much sense at the time.  I pull over and she opens the car door and falls straight on her face to the concrete with no warning. It was a very hard hit and I run to the side to help her, she then gets up before I can get to her and her legs collapse from under her and I can hear what sounded like her literal skull break against the concrete from the force. She later explained to me that while she had gone blind, it was like her body was in survival mode and was telling her there were bushes and grass where she was jumping on to, and not the concrete that was actually there. Also, she remembers only having a very soft fall and landing on her bottom, which did not happen. Almost like she was completely out of it and imagining things completely.

I\u2019m trying to help my elderly mum find a food she had as a child that she hasn\u2019t come across for 60+ years.  For context her dad (my grandad) worked on the canals in the UK and he would sometimes be given small amounts of the food that was being transported on the barges. As many foods were rationed during the war, treats were few and far between and obviously one of these has stuck in her memory.  She has described it as a raw chocholate that was white/off-white in colour that came in shards/chucks with a crunchy honeycomb like texture but was drier and did not dissolve like honeycomb does. It was very sweet and she thinks it tastes like chocolate.  I bought some organic cocoa butter as she saw a picture and thought it looked similar but perhaps was a bit darker.

{"prompt": "CMV: People in the U.S. need to stop trying to solve most issues through the federal government. Most issues should be solved through state legislation. I'm talking healthcare, education, gun control, drug reform, etc.  Many of the issues we see in U.S. politics stem from, I believe, people trying to push too much legislation through the federal government.    I think both sides are guilty of this (liberals more so in my opinion), and that doing so creates a situation where people from more liberally/conservatively minded states try to impose their ideas of government down the throats of those with different views from different states. Creating such a situation is a mistake, as it makes people who live in states that are on the receiving end feel alienated and threatened, leading them to vote for extremist federal representatives (both congressional and presidential) that will fight tooth and nail against what they perceive as a legislative takeover. If such conflicts were relegated the individual states, we wouldn't see such a country-wide meltdown in civility.  Take gun rights as an example. When liberals try to push gun regulation on the federal level, those from more conservative-minded states will naturally feel as though their ideas of what constitutes proper gun regulation are being threatened. Such an issue should be left to the individual state, since if those from a certain state feel they need to modernize their laws gun regulation they absolutely have the power to do so. For example, the liberally-minded state I live in banned bump stocks before they were banned federally, and as I suspected, the federal ban was much much more controversial among people in conservative-minded states around the country than the state ban. If those from such conservative-minded states felt like banning bump stocks was important, they would have pushed for the legislation themselves, instead it was forced down their throats.  &#x200B;  I get that doing things on the federal level is a more efficient way of pushing one's agenda, but just understand that you're gonna piss off a lot of people who will inevitably elect extremists as a form of political backlash.", "completion": "I think one big problem that hasn't been brought up is gerrymandering.  It's difficult to support states taking over such critical policies when you have instances of one party getting more votes than the other, but getting fewer representatives elected.  I won't support or reject your view, but in the spirit of experimentation I would be curious on pushing more state legislation if the following was done throughout the country first:  1. No gerrymandering period.  Districts are independently done and out in the open. Use a mathematical formula,  or an independent commission,  I don't care.  As long as the controlling party doesn't have a controlling stake.  2. Voting days are a state holiday or make it easier to vote.  DMV, online, etc  3. Ranked choice voting  4. Publicly funded elections.  Get private money out   If these conditions are met, I'd be willing to experiment it."}

You guys have a lot more experience than me, in both engineering and in life, so **I humbly seek your wisdom.**  &#x200B;  * I will be applying for Space and Space Robotics related fields (very niche). * Switzerland does not have a space program and is not part of the EU, but is a founding member of ESA and has multiple appealing space related startups (ClearSpace recently just won an ESA grant), and works tightly with the EU. It also has an incredibly strong academic appeal, being home to CERN, EPFL, ETH etc. (in fact, EPFL has a \"Space Center\" called eSpace) * Germany is part of the EU and has a space program, has way more space related companies and projects. * Switzerland's salaries are comparable to US salaries, offer incredibly strong purchasing power, are taxed way less.  * Germany's salaries are amongst the highest in Europe, but so are its taxes and its salaries cannot even begin to compete with Swiss salaries. On top of that, about HALF of my entire gross income would disappear to taxes (which although I am happy to pay for certain things like healthcare and education, I'd much rather have the freedom to invest for my own pension). * Switzerland is the only real, direct democracy, in the entire world. * (VERY ballpark figures) prospected Switzerland **net** salary: 60k\\~80k (maybe more?), prospected Germany **net** salary: 30k+ * Both countries are absolutely gorgeous.  So there you have it... I am extremely passionate in my studies and my future career, but I am also very passionate in life in general.

I realise this might be an impossible question. Tear me down and slap me a new one if you must, I really need some external thoughts because I've been pondering about this on my own for far too long...

{"prompt": "My roommate\u2019s cat has serious behavioral issues that I\u2019ve tried numerous times to talk to my roommate about. He\u2019s always denied everything and refused to hear about it, but tonight the cat attacked me so bad I ended up needing sutures and I\u2019m on sick leave. Can I sue him and how? I\u2019m a 20 years old female student living in Quebec, Canada.   I moved in with my roommate (33,M)  last July. I met him through an add that he posted when he was looking for a roommate. He seemed like a pretty decent guy, no red flags about him so I agreed to move in. He told me he has a cat that rarely comes out of the storage room and is very shy. That\u2019s all.   Turns out, the cat, Gus, is a living demon. Usually, I\u2019m very good with animals. My mom always said I was gifted because I\u2019ve always been able to approach, tame and comfort any animal I\u2019ve ever met. But not this cat. Gus has some serious behavioral issues. At first, it started with him pooping and peeing everywhere in the apartment, especially on the couch. No big deal, just gotta clean it and it\u2019s forgotten. It never came out of the storage room, to the point where my roommate had to put his food and water bowls and his litter box in the storage room. I get it, I\u2019m an intruder in his space. I thought if I gave the cat lots of space and let it take it\u2019s time, it would get used to my presence. It did the complete opposite. Since September, the cat waits for me to wake up and get out of my bedroom in the morning, and attacks me. It claws my legs and hisses and freaks out as soon as it sees me, and I almost never really notice it first, as it hides and waits for me to get close enough. So almost every morning, I get surprise-attacked as soon as I wake up. I told my roommate multiple times about this, and he never cared. The cat also screams bloody murder every single night, it\u2019s so loud even the neighbors hear it (we live in an apartment building). The cat really sounds like it\u2019s in agony, it\u2019s really frightening. The cat shows ALL signs of anxiety disorder. I\u2019ve tried every way of talking to my roommate about it, even offered to pay for half of the vet bill if we take it there, but my roommate doesn\u2019t want to hear it. He keeps buying essential oil diffuser and catnip, expecting it to magically solve the issue. I suggested once that my roommate put the cat on antidepressants, and my roommate was so offended by it, he kicked me out and gave me 1 month to find another place and leave. He said that clearly I\u2019m not compatible with the cat, so I have to move. I didn\u2019t sign the lease when I moved in (I know, foolish), so I found another place and I\u2019m moving in December 12th. I have proof of every single discussion we\u2019ve had, since we only talk through texting, due to him working night shifts so I barely see him.   What makes my blood boil is that this poor cat is suffering, yet my roommate doesn\u2019t want to do anything about it. He\u2019s never taken the cat to the vet, he\u2019s never even held the cat and he never pets it, since it\u2019s always in the storage room.   Tonight, I was on my way to leave the apartment, when the cat jumped out of nowhere and started attacking me. Since I\u2019m getting used to his attacks, I always wear jeans, thick slippers and my winter coat when I\u2019m outside my bedroom, as protection. But the cat bit my hand and wouldn\u2019t let go. I tried to shake it off but it just kept digging his teeth in. Eventually it let go and i ran to the neighbors, screaming that I needed help. I was covered in blood and having a panic attack, so they took me to the hospital. I had to get stitches, antibiotics and I\u2019m on sick leave until December 1rst. The cat bit so deep my muscle was exposed but luckily intact. I still can\u2019t move my thumb or wrist because of the swelling.   I have proof of all of this (pictures, screenshots).  Can I sue my roommate? For what motives? Can I do something about the cat? Can I call someone to remove it from here and give it an proper shot at life?", "completion": "Tbh it sounds like this cat is fatal or has a severe case of anxiety and ptsd and something keeps triggering it. Yes you can sue for you medical bills and also report this to animal control. If he\u2019s never been to the vet there is a chance they will want to quarantine the cat for rabies and they may ask you to get the shots to be on the safe side."}
{"prompt": "Why should we study hard Philosophers like Hegel? I met up with a friend of mine the other day. I told him I was studying Hegel and he scoffed. He has no time for people like Hegel, Heidegger, Deleuze and Kant, he calls them deadwood. He said they are too up themselves and they are not good writers. He believes that the role of a good writer and philosopher is to be understood, which he argues Hegel and people like him are not understandable. He likes Locke, Hobbes, Popper. Now, of course, I didn't like hearing this and he hasn't read any Heidegger and he has only read a summary of Hegel's Philosophy of History. But his challenge and negation of technical philosophers remains. Why should we study Hegel? Why can't Hegel just be clearer, why speak about ontology or metaphysics when we can just speak psychologically and with common sense ? Why not get rid of the deadwood. His question is why justify a deep study of Hegel and technical philosophy? I am interested to hear your thoughts.", "completion": "Read Hegel, don't read Hegel... There's a whole lot of great philosophy out there and I'm not convinced that any particular philosopher is absolutely necessary for studying philosophy.  Some philosophers have been very influential, so maybe there's reason to talk of canons or ideological pedigrees and such, but it's possible to read around Hegel and even around Kant.  But your friend's reasoning for why he wasn't interested in reading these philosophers (and worse, his disdain for anyone who would do otherwise) strikes me as an indication of a really lazy attitude.  He seems to think that he shouldn't have to put any work into trying to understand someone else's ideas, and that just seems like a recipe for only ever really thinking about ideas that aren't too different from his naive opinions.  Read Hegel if you find his project interesting, or if you want access to the conversations that are influenced by Hegel.  Or maybe read Hegel *because* he's notoriously difficult, and it's an exercise that trains your hermeneutic chops.  Or don't.  There's plenty of other stuff to read.  But don't avoid something *just because* it's difficult.  That's just lazy."}

The desserts though, specifically the cookies, are what are quite nice and really regional to where my family comes from. The amaretti are well known around the country and so are the struffoli (little fried dough balls with honey; typically neapolitan, but known around the south of Italy), but the purcidrati and mostaccioli are what I live for.  Purcidrati (which is the regional Sicilian name; cucciddati everywhere else) are these little doughy cookies filled with a fig, almond, orange, and spice jam mixture. They are so good but are not super common or well known across the rest of Italy.  Mostaccioli are my favourite though.

When the market tanks (like it has today), it doesn't mean it's his fault either despite declining responsibility.  I see the irony in this. It's highly hypocritical for him to behave like this but if we were to be truly objective, neither ups or downs are because of him. It's because of a rogue, half-alive, half-inert \"organism\" that acts without reason. While the topic of how much of a hit the markets take because of his action or inaction is surely debatable, I find it disingenuous to blame this on Trump. The markets would be tanking right now if Hillary was president.  There it is. I'm open to having my mind changed", "completion": "The problem with this argument is that coronavirus isn't affecting all countries equally. Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan are all much closer to China and are much more densely populated than the US. But their leaders had far better responses to the virus. Thus their populations are at lower risk of dying and their economies haven't suffered as much when compared to countries with terrible responses to the virus such as the US.  The best boxers know how to take a punch. They know that they are going to get hit at some point, but the minimize the chances of getting punched, and they roll with it when hit. The stupidest boxers drop their hands and stiffen up when hit. Trump did several extremely stupid things to make this crisis far worse than it needed to be.  When the economy is good, you want to save money for a rainy day. Instead, Trump goosed the economy upfront so he could prop up the market and ensure his reelection. He did this by directly giving out a massive corporate tax cut. That's great at boosting the market, but you can only do it once.   More importantly, Trump kept pressuring the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. They didn't listen to them because they aren't stupid. But Trump did several stupid things such as argue with Iran, abandon Europe as an ally, start a trade war with China, etc. All of these things increased geopolitical risk, which forced the Fed to keep interest rates low even though the economy was booming. Low interest rates mean companies spend more and boost the economy, but the problem is that you can't lower the interest rates too much. If you are at 3% you can lower it to 1%. But the Fed was already at 1%. Now it's just above 0%. Now they are seriously considering going into negative interest rates, which is a disaster (it literally means paying someone to borrow money from you).  Trump also fired biosecurity experts and shut down the biodefense team that Obama started to protect the US from Ebola and other diseases. Now he's lying about it even though there are literally videos of him bragging about it from 2 years ago.  Finally, Trump knew this was a problem for months now. But instead of being proactive, he downplayed it to protect the market in the short term. He said it was just a Democrat plot to make him look bad. He mocked Biden and Sanders for cancelling their Ohio rallies, and scheduled one of his own. There are thousands of examples of him doing this over the past 3 months.  Then when he finally started to respond, he didn't do it in a straightforward way. He appointed Mike Pence to lead the task force instead of an actual public health professional. He shut down travel, but not based on COVID-19 risk. Instead he did it based on his personal political alliances (e.g., flights from Merkel and Macron's Germany and France were blocked, but flights from Boris Johnson's UK were still allowed).  Trump did every single thing wrong here. The funniest thing was seeing how little investors respect him. He gave a 15 minute speech in the Oval Office that was meant to reassure the nation. From the time he started talking to the time he stopped, S&P 500 futures had dropped 7%. He gave another speech on Friday evening. This time he learned his lesson and gave a new plan. The market jumped 9% on his speech, and then closed right afterwards. Everyone had time to listen to the message, but not enough time to scrutinize the details. They used the weekend for this purpose, which is why the market dropped 11% immediately upon opening on Monday morning.  It's very difficult for a president to boost the economy, but it's very easy for them to tank it. Economic growth relies on hundreds of millions of individuals working together. Meanwhile, with a push of a button, the president could launch a nuke at Iran or China and plunge the global economy into an immediate and deep recession. Trump's failure in handling coronavirus is not as direct as launching nuke, but it's as bad as failing to respond to an enemy nuke.  But what do you expect? Donald Trump is the world's most famous anti-vaxxer. Mike Pence doesn't believe in evolution. Neither of these men are remotely qualified to handle a newly evolved virus. Neither of them had built a positive relationship with China such that they would accept the US's help in containing the virus in Wuhan.  Ultimately, Donald Trump didn't create the virus. But he utterly failed at responding to it, which is main reason why the US economy has tanked. If he was half as competent as the leaders of countries like Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, etc. then the US economy would not have suffered as badly and millions fewer Americans would die."}

I can say that if you qualify for an APA (or equivalent scholarship) and can get either a fee-free place or a fee-waiver/scholarship for fees, then doing your PhD in Sydney will not add to any debt you may have. I also found that living on the APA was easily affordable, especially if you are willing to live with others.  As for afterwards, I've seen most people manage to land post-docs in Europe and America. It does not seem to be a disadvantage to do your PhD here, especially if your supervisors are well established with connections."}

{"prompt": "CMV: Most of the deaths of military members in Afghanistan did not serve a greater purpose and were in vain. Perpetuating the myth that all of these deaths are heroic & serve some greater purpose is spreading military propaganda & is not in the interest of civilians or enlisted people. I think about this a lot and while it's very not polite and upsetting to people to hear I think it's important to talk about. I think not talking about this is more harmful for future victims of these wars than the harm that comes from talking about it. Nothing can really be undone regarding the people that have already died during wars like Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam but we can potentially reduce future victims by shining some light on this and pushing back on the propaganda that the military has successfully pushed into the cultural zeitgeist.  &#x200B;  My belief is that the narrative in broader US society is that being in the military is a noble and profession, they're some of the most revered people in society today by the general population. Out of that group of people, the military, the most revered are people that were killed in a war. I feel like the general feeling people have is that deaths of active duty military people in war are heroic, they have some meaning, & that they serve some greater good. They're viewed as a sacrifice for something greater.  &#x200B;  In reality I don't know that I think that's true... I feel this way about Iraq, Afghanistan, and Vietnam but we can just keep it to Afghanistan for this conversation since it's in the news a lot right now. If we take a sheet of paper & make a pros and cons list for this war I think it might look something like this:  &#x200B;  Cons: About 241,000 people have been killed in the Afghanistan and Pakistan war zone since 2001. More than 71,000 of those killed have been civilians (source, cost of war project).  &#x200B;  We have 2,352 deaths of US servicemembers and 20,149 wounded in action. That's not counting coalition forces and US contractors.  &#x200B;  I don't even want to talk about the money that was spent on these wars because that's a whole separate issue to me.  &#x200B;  Pros:  &#x200B;  They have a 'functioning' government and democracy?  &#x200B;  Women and girls seems to generally have more freedom now  &#x200B;  I'm going to cut this list short because the things on the pros side I think actually don't matter and I'll tell you why... Anything you can think of to put on the pros side I want you to think of that line item & think if that will still be true in 5 years... 10 years... 15 years...?  &#x200B;  Now look at the cons side, those dead people are dead forever. The wounded people are dead forever. There's orphans and widows and broken people on all sides. Those things I think will be true longer than any positive things we brought to Afghanistan.  &#x200B;  I also want to address a response that I think will be brought up by someone and I think this is just a very successful example of military propaganda. It'll go something like this \"When you're over there you're not fighting for some geopolitical goal or grand strategy, you're fighting for the person next to you and they're fighting for you.\"  &#x200B;  I'm sure we've all heard that before, it's a very common Hollywood trope. Again I think this is propaganda and a coping mechanism by people that are in war zones & suffering casualties. The thing that would most benefit the person next to you is not you fighting for them it would be for both of you to not be at risk of dying or killing other people for something that is unnecessary and unproductive.  &#x200B;  Perpetuating this meme of a meaningful death & heroism is not supporting the troops in my opinion, it's very much the opposite. Young men are very susceptible this kind of messaging which is why it's done by the military. Anyone that is not involved with military recruitment that helps them spread this idea is doing harm to people that might be inspired by it to join the military and become one of these deaths themselves. I think we need to very much push back on this and talk about it openly.  &#x200B;  TLDR: I think that the idea that military deaths in war are inherently heroic and meaningful is military propaganda and it's harmful for society to continue to perpetuate it.", "completion": "I only want to focus three parts of this, which are the phrase military propaganda, the military as a noble profession, and your concept of heroicism. I won't even argue with you about whether it was a just war, although I think we would disagree.   The military did not decide to go to war in Afghanistan, and they don't have the power to make that call. The military hardly even decided how to prosecute that war at the strategic level. The military didn't decide to gut the Afghanistan effort to focus on Iraq, didn't decide the size or composition of the surge, and didn't define the drone policy in the larger Middle East that inspired fighters to go to Afghanistan.  Those decisions came from people in Congress, and of course the executive branch including civilians at the DoD, but that is not the military. When the SEC DEF and President ask the Joint Chiefs about a problem, it is their job to present options. Only when Congress or the White House turns that option into a political tool does it become propaganda. Only when Congress and the Executive decide to act out those options do they become just or unjust or meaningful or meaningless wars.  I think you've erroneously coupled the decision to go to war and stay at war with the ethical standing of the military. The military did not make those calls. The military generates a tiny proportion of the propaganda related to those decisions when compared to Congress and the larger executive branch in the form of campaign material. Even if what you said is true and it was a meaningless conflict, that should reflect on our elected officials and our voting public much moreso than on our military.   So is the military still a noble profession? Well the oath of each service member is to the constitution above all else. This means two things. First, defend against those that undermine our ability to carry out the government described in the constitution. Second (more relevant here) act in the manner prescribed in the constitution, as an apolitical tool for the public as directed by a representative government. Would you consider the military to have been MORE noble for refusing to carry out the orders of a fairly elected government and violating a constitutional oath? I certainly wouldn't.   The military isn't considered a noble profession for the good decisions of politicians nor an ignoble profession for their bad decisions. The military is considered a noble profession because of the willingness to sacrifice in defense of the Constitution. More specifically, because service members are expected to accomplish what is asked of them without violating the law, even when violating the law would be the safer or more sure way to accomplish that goal.   Finally, heroism is a matter of perspective. A firefighter saving a cat is a hero to the four year old pet owner but internationally meaningless. A Soldier who gets killed patrolling the streets of Afghanistan may be meaningless to you. Then again maybe he's patrolling that street because a General decided unobserved artillery and drone strikes were killing too many civilians and that guy was supposed to be the observer on the ground. The same could be said for everyone in Afghanistan. We could have bombed everything that moved in Afghanistan and never lost a life, but we chose not to do it that way and that's why those Soldiers are seen as heros."}

On this subreddit and others, there are many posts on this topic, and they send mixed signals about how getting fired influences your career. Often, people act like being fired is potentially career ending, and can relegate you to an hourly position for the rest of your days. On the other hand, it is sometimes encouraged for people to wait to be let go in order to pursue unemployment benefits or a severance package.  I have read that most employers do not even check references in one thread, and that references are all-important in others.  So, which is it? Is being fired really a big deal?

No one has asked more more about it, and I have references from that position.  I'm also under the impression being fired is a bigger deal for large, or old fashioned, companies. With COVID, a lot of people have been let go. It's not as taboo has it use to be.

{"prompt": "CMV: denouncing protests based on violence or lawbreaking is a copout This is something I have thought a lot about, watching the BLM protests in the USA and the Truckers anti-vaccine mandate protests in Ottawa, Canada over the past few years. There are more examples but those two are particularly interesting because one represents more leftist ideology and the other more right wing ideology, though I'm sure there is plenty of overlap. But for simplification purposes I'm going to talk about how both those opposed to the protests and those in favour of them act.  In all the coverage of these protests, the opposition is always looking to point out vandalism, resisting the police, illegal occupation of streets, looting, breaking by-laws, violence, etc. Basically any infraction of the law is held up as a reason to disregard the message of the protestors. Meanwhile the supporters are always urging 'peaceful protests' and downplaying any illegal activity as being fringe and not on message.  But let's be real here. Protests are the expression of public outrage at a system that is failing them. In both the cases I mentioned, extremely personal and important concerns were on the line. Many African Americans felt like they were fighting for not just an idea, but survival. Many, many people lost their jobs, their small businesses, and their life's work/dreams over how the governments enforced covid. I know several. Regardless of how you agree or disagree with these people, the desperation that makes them stand toe to toe with armored police and risk imprisonment, beatings, fines, etc., is very very real.  It's simply unacceptable to expect these people to hold up a sign during government approved hours in a government approved location and to obey all appropriate bylaws. The entire point of protests is to be disruptive and uncomfortable. Some people will take an incredibly pacifistic approach. But change is just as affected by those with a more extreme approach to things.  In short, I'm not encouraging people to smash store windows or throw things at the police or to block essential traffic. But I do think that A) it in no way should be used to diminish or dismiss their cause, and B) it is very naive to expect real change to not be accompanied by some level of lawlessness, because the 'law' is what is on trial in a protest.", "completion": "Say the same thing about jan 6th and ill believe you have a real view."}
{"prompt": "CMV: Not tipping your delivery driver or server is a dick move and \"they should be paid a living wage\" isn't a good reason not to. There's a post on r/all right now about Dominos having a blurb on their box asking you to tip higher for good service. Which is a shitty thing for the corporation to do when they could just pay their drivers a higher hourly rate. Literally everyone agrees on that.   But if you use that as a reason to 'go against the company' and not tip, you're not doing anything to the company you're just hurting some 17 year olds income, and you as a consumer should be doing all you can to help the people providing you that service.   I currently work in a restaurant as both a cook and a waiter, depending on what they need me as, and was a delivery driver for the Hut before this job. So often Ill engage in conversation with one of the other servers and they will be saying how their tables didn't tip and how just one big party not tipping can absolutely destroy their night.   We're already working for a very unstable income so you as a consumer of our services should be doing what you can to support us, until the company decides to do so itself. Not tipping us and killing our income isn't the way to do it, protest it by supporting a higher minimum wage or better work laws regarding tip culture.

You can\u2019t force customers to pay, unless it\u2019s a displayed added fee customers can see prior to deciding whether or not to eat somewhere, which is the same thing as effectively raising menu prices in order to actually pay their employees more. This is the same thing as the restaurant taking responsibility for their employees, which every other type of non tipped wage business does. The Dept. of Labor found that 84% of restaurants don\u2019t actually make up the difference for employees whose tips don\u2019t add up to minimum wage, so they\u2019re already violating that law. Doing away with tipped wages altogether is a much more straightforward way of solving this issue without guilting customers who are just trying to get a meal.  Tipping as a practice is racist and sexist, BIPOC servers/drivers are tipped less when they are and frequently not tipped at all, women put up with sexual harassment for fear of not getting tipped if they defend themselves and respond in a way the harasser doesn\u2019t like.  It is not fair that someone\u2019s income and ability to earn a living is predicated on others discriminatory biases.  Personally now I am privileged enough that I don\u2019t have to purchase takeout or eat at restaurants. I don\u2019t eat at places that have tipped wages because I believe the practice is unfair. I have the time and money to cook my own food. But oftentimes, and especially in cities where groceries are expensive and food deserts abound (another issue that primarily affects BIPOC in cities as well as rural areas), getting a meal from a restaurant either eating in or taking out costs the same or is even cheaper when factoring in time saved from grocery shopping and doing the cooking.  Not everyone who patronizes businesses with tipped wages are doing so because it\u2019s a luxury, they might be a single mother who needs to feed her kids however she can, or a disabled person who isn\u2019t able to consistently cook. These people don\u2019t necessarily have the money to tip. To someone who doesn\u2019t track every cent, a couple dollars here and there may not matter, but for many they do. You can\u2019t fault someone for having to eat, everyone has to eat. Customers will select businesses based on their menu, and their prices. It\u2019s the restaurant\u2019s responsibility to pay their employees, and to price their product accordingly in order to be able to afford that cost of doing business. Putting it onto the whims of the customer hurts many more servers than the few often white and male servers it helps.  I\u2019m on my phone right now but if you look up \u201cdiscriminatory tipping\u201d you\u2019ll find plenty of information on the predatory history of how tipping came to be, a way to avoid paying   Black freedmen wages now that they weren\u2019t slaves.  Edit: got on my computer to add some external references:  Women make less than men, Black and Latino make less than White and Asian.  6.3% of general US workers fall under the poverty line (the way poverty is determined in the US is outdated, solely based on the cost of food with no regard to local cost of living, but I digress), and yet 14.5% of tipped workers fall under the poverty line. Predictably, as the tipped wage increases, the poverty level of those employees shrinks.  Heres some news articles that go over major points if you want a quick read. They reference many studies as well.  https://www.eater.com/a/case-against-tipping  https://www.vox.com/2014/7/17/5888347/one-more-case-against-tipping"}
{"prompt": "Why is it easier for a Japanese restaurant to get a 4.5+ star rating than a Thai place? I adore Thai food. But I've noticed that even my very favorite Thai spots usually get a max of 4.4 stars on Google. It's very difficult for them to break that barrier.  By contrast, I've eaten at very well-rated Japanese places. And people seem more generous with their ratings for Japanese food. I was wondering why that is?  My current theories: I know there's a 'culinary register' where certain cuisines are considered upper-class and others not so upper class, and I think Japanese food would be considered more upper class than Thai (both a recent history as an Empire, the expense of the ingredients and how difficult it is to make, and the portion sizes), and I wonder where that plays into it.", "completion": "Japanese food is the Italian food of Asian cuisine.

Try real Sichuan hot pot, it's DELICIOUS. Don't even get me started of Filipino food, so many flavors you just didn't even imagine marrying into gorgeous meals.

{"prompt": "[CA] what to do about high turnover for one shift Hello everyone. I work in crisis management in a 24/7 setting. I have had ridiculously high turnover this year for one specific position and time. The other two shifts (identical) have employees of 5+ years who report being satisfied, but this one shift I have is cursed. In the interview I am transparent and let people know why this position sucks and all the worst things that could happen. Everyone says they\u2019re up for the challenge and understand crisis intervention is like that and then they quit. Now I\u2019m going to have a 5th opening in a year. What can I do differently? What do I need to look at?", "completion": "The fact that you have longer-term employees in the other two shifts suggests this isn't necessarily an issue of the direct nature of the work and more an issue of the time of the shift. It's weird you don't specify which shift.  Is it the graveyard? Something around Midnight to 8am? I supported a warehouse that wasn't 24/7 but our 2nd shift (\\~5pm to 1 am) had much higher turnover when I started there. The goal of most night shift employees was to move to day, even though day paid less.  I did a few things, not sure which of these would be applicable in your situation:  \\- started conducting interviews at night - like 7pm. Inconvenient for me but definitely sent the message to folks that it was really a night shift and if they didn't want that time of day they were less likely to even show up to the interview.  \\- started focusing on people who had done night shift in the past. Some people actually prefer nights. Look for those folks.  \\- started overlapping my shift with their by at least a couple hours at least once a week. Gave them more access to me so they felt more heard and important and let me learn earlier if there was stuff going on I could help with. Actually found out there was a bully on shift this way and got rid of him (serious bully, violent threats and actions) which resulted in a big decrease in turnover. The Operations manager also started working basically the same shift as them about once a month, as did the warehouse manager.  \\- loosened up overtime controls for the night shift (but not the day shift). Most folks liked to get an hour or so of OT a day (not always, was never mandatory) so if there was extra work that needed to be done, night shift got first crack at it.  We already had a shift differential in place. Didn't increase it. It was still higher turnover than days, but ended up with stable crews that lasted 9-12 months, which was very manageable, instead of a revolving door."}

How can I sit in a ~200\u00b0 F sauna and not get burned, but water the same temperature spilled on my arm will burn and blister my skin?", "completion": "Both correct answers are here already but neither in the same post with one another.  First, water has high heat capacity.  That means that even a small change in temperature for water = a ton of energy.  So 200 degree water has thousands of times more heat than air for every degree of temperature change, and that's based on MASS.  The density of water is much higher than that of air so there's a lot more of it close to you when you're exposed to it.  Finally, because of the density, it transfers energy much much faster.  Heat is transferred when molecules hit one another - more density means more molecules close together, which means more collisions = faster energy transfer.  For an example of this at work try to bake a potato in a 450 deg F oven while boiling one in 212 deg F (boiling) water.  Should go alot faster in the water.  tl;dr - Water has more energy in a smaller space and transfers that energy much faster."}

{"prompt": "Neighbors child has disabilities and won't stop climbing the fence, entering my house and \"freeing\" my dogs For the past 7 months after moving in to my new house with my daughter and dogs the neighbors child who's 15/16 and has pretty severe downs syndrome has increasingly been entering my property and home.  At first I just talked to the neighbors and they were at first really sorry and vowed to monitor her more while she's in their backyard. However after a few months they just genuinely do not care anymore and brush it off.  I've installed security cameras in the backyard and front yard purely for my own safety insurance wise because we do have a pool.   She will climb the fence into my yard (6' wooden privacy fence) with a ladder from their shed and let my dogs out. I've fixed her letting my dogs \"free\" as she says by using chains and padlocks on the two gates. Before this became a common occurrence she even would let the dogs out of the house and then \"free\" them.   Numerous times if my garage door is open she will leave their backyard and just walk into my house to free my dogs. I don't know what the purpose is other than it's something she just has to do for whatever reason.  When she climbs into the backyard (sometimes when I'm not even home) and she cannot get back out she begins screaming and crying and just shuts down. Before I started chaining and locking my gates because of her releasing my dogs her parents would just walk in and get her and leave. Now since I've chained it they start a huge fit about me having her locked in my backyard and they have to climb the fence, bring the ladder over and carry her back over. Somehow this is my fault.  Now I'm not really blaming her because she mentally doesn't know any better, she has some very severe issues and she's damn lucky my dogs are super nice (purebred German Shepard, an English bulldog and a mix Sheppard/bulldog).  I just honestly worry about her safety in the backyard, climbing fences and her seemingly not being watched as she needs to be. I have a pool and if she falls in when I'm not home she could very well drown. That's why I installed security cameras to cover my own ass if that ever happens, I truly hope it never does but it seems her parents just put her in the backyard and that's it.  I've called the local child and family services office (CPS) several times in the past two months to report it because I feel she is at risk with her parents inattentiveness and their seemingly not caring attitude of her just going into people's yards, garages, houses etc. I have a full garage of power tools, table saws etc that I've now had to resort to flipping the breaker off when I open the doors out of fear she may severely injure herself.  I feel like I've done everything I can, talked to the parents numerous times, called child and family services, installed cameras, locked my gates further. I just have no idea what to do now? I've debated calling the police when she enters but I don't know how that will escalate.", "completion": "Not a lawyer.   My son just went through an almost identical situation.

He always wanted to pet the dogs. Son explained to him and his parents that he needs to knock on the front door when he wants to pet them so the owners can let the dogs know it\u2019s not an intruder.   He warned them the kid continues to trespass they did nothing. He called police when the kid continued to trespass.   He installed security cameras. Three days after installing them the kid falls while climbing his fence and the parents try to sue him.   Police reports helped kill the case even faster than the footage.   Best of luck to you!"}
{"prompt": "eli5 How does Queen Ants get so big? Do they just live longer? Is it that royalty bloodline? She just eat a lot more?", "completion": "We're not sure.  This is not the same as bees, where the worker bees feed a prospective queen with a \"Royal Jelly\" that triggers the genetic maturation into a reproducing female, or queen. For ants, the process is much less well-understood.  But what definitely happens is that ant demographics and resources determine what the larvae develop into. If they are low on resources and have a queen already, all the new ants will be female workers. As the colony stockpiles more resources and has a healthy number of workers, some of the larvae will develop into reproducing females. What we do not know is how they are selected or how the process is triggered. It might be a special diet or a nutritional threshold, or perhaps a critical mass of pheromones.  What is important is that the queen is not genetically different from a worker. She is an ordinary larva until something triggers her development into a princess/new queen. This is the same for all female ants, by the way - all female ants start as the same larvae and what they grow up into is determined by external factors (diet/pheromones). Male ants (used only for reproduction) are an important exception - they are born from unfertilized eggs.  Once a queen has mated, found a nice place for a new colony and started laying, she's tremendously vulnerable until the first workers hatch and begin working. In the meantime she is basically ~~starving~~ not eating, living off the fat from her wing muscles (Thanks u/4991123). ~~Some ant species~~ Most queens tear off their own wings and atrophy their flight muscles to reduce their caloric needs as well. Hatched workers gather food for the new colony and feed the queen.  She eats a lot, because she needs the nutrients to lay eggs. An ant queen eats significantly more protein than workers (and in fact some researchers theorize that protein intake can trigger the development of a larva to reproductive female). This is what causes her to grow so large... but she also grows so large because of her genetic triggers. Depending on the ant species, a queen may not look significantly different from most ants, but there's a pretty universal way to tell: queen ants usually have enlarged thoraxes, the middle \"chest\" part of the ant. Some species also have enlarged abdomens, the back \"butt\" part of the ant. Basically, queen be swole. And often also thicc.  Not every ant species follows this exact pattern. Many colonies have more than one queen. Some ant species do not even need to mate, producing workers that are all genetic clones through parthenogenesis. Colonies with multiple queens can split and even migrate. But the principle is the same - the queen lays eggs, the colony feeds her, protects her, and cleans her with the highest priority, so she gets big.  EDIT: u/Gochaocha has posted an article with more recent information that indicates a queen develops from a combination of genetic expression (that is, how/how much a particular gene is used by an organism), and protein diet.  EDIT: Ok way too many people are asking me how male ants hatch from unfertilized eggs, so I'm sticking my reply into my original post:  >Okay first of all, ants do not have an XY and XX chromosome system. Instead, they have a haploid and diploid chromosome system for the sexes.   >   >Diploids, with chromosomes from both parents (i.e. queen lays an egg fertilized with sperm from the male), are born female. The vast majority of ants - every single worker and majors (\"soldiers\") are sterile females. The queen(s) are the only reproductive females, though some species have workers capable of laying unfertilized male eggs if the queen dies (the males fly off and the colony is still doomed).   >   >Haploids, with only half the chromosomes, all of which are from one parent, the queen (i.e. they are not fertilized eggs) are born male. The male only needs half the chromosomes because his sole function is to fly away and deliver his genetic material to princesses (new queens) from other colonies. After mating he dies."}

{"prompt": "Mexican Melting Cheese?  This may be a really dumb question, but here goes. A few years ago, when I was in grad school, some classmates and I were having conversations over lunch about what we usually bring. One girl starts talking about her lunch, which she already ate.  She said that she had chips and queso. She claimed the queso was exactly like the \"white\" queso you get at an American Mexican restaurant, and she made it herself. The other girls at the table stared at her in amazement and asked her how she makes it. She claimed that all she did was take a chunk of the \"mexican melting cheese\" that you can get at the supermarket. Chop it up a little and then throw it in the microwave for a minute or two, stopping every 30 seconds or so to stir.  So the other day when I was at the grocery, this popped into my head and I was really craving that white queso stuff. I bought a few blocks of the Mexican melting cheese. It claims on the package to be Mexican melting cheese and is labeled: Kroger Ole Oaxaca cheese.  So I am doing searches online for Tex-Mex queso recipes, and not a single one of them mentions this sort of cheese. And also, their recipes call for A LOT more ingredients like condensed milk, chopped chilis, mozzerella, etc. Now I don't know what to do with this cheese.  Did I get duped? I don't feel like experimenting and making a cheesy mess right now, so I figured I would come here first before attempting.

Also, I was thinking I could cool down my job search until the economy gets better and try to learn new things/start a project. I've been learning Python for modeling/simulation, and I'm also interested in getting a cheap FDM printer to experiment around, build something interesting, add to my skills/showcase it on my resume, etc. If anyone has ideas on side projects, please let me know! :) I'd love to learn more.  My questions are: Would it be wise to also look for technician jobs? Am I better off trying to spend my efforts learning more skills or pursuing side projects until economy get better? I heard that once you take a technician job it may be hard to get into an engineering role afterwards, please correct me if I'm wrong! I know COVID19 and the craziness is a first for many people, but I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice/encouraging words on what I can do right now. Thanks again!", "completion": "You landed in a really strange moment in time. Everything is confusing and many of the old standard rules just don't apply right now. I am sorry, that honestly sucks for someone starting out.  Here are the two things that I can give for advice that hopefully will be useful and honest, given the situation.  1. Believe this will pass.  I have been alive long enough to see the world shift around a lot. This is a big one, but after all the chaos gets sorted out there will be opportunities. Probably ones that no one expects. Believe in that and work towards it. Do what you need to now but keep focused on a better future and it will come.  Take a technician job if you need to (and can) but don't let that be your endpoint. Keep looking towards the place where you want to be.  2. Even when you have nothing to do, do significant things.  This is actually the more important one. Don't even let yourself be completely idle. Find something you are interested in or care about and work on it. Do it publicly and collaboratively if you can.  In this, you are lucky. The world is set up for all kinds of challenging, open and collaborative projects. Join one and make a significant contribution.  If you really have a passion for something then create a project of your own. Share the ideas and grow the concept.  The strange truth is that far more innovation comes out of hard times than good times.  By actively and publicly working on something you will get the attention of other like-minded people. These are the people who will be driving innovation in the future. Some of them are already in those roles.  When the time comes for gathering new talent you will be on that list. The best part is these people are also the exact ones you want to work with if you enjoy challenges and new ideas.  When the world sorts itself out again, you want to be ready to take advantage of the best opportunity you can grab onto. You are young and have energy. Use it to do something significant now and that will open doors later.  Sincerely, good luck."}
{"prompt": "How long can I store hummus in a refrigerator? I made hummus at home and I was wondering how long I can store it and use it. Ingredients: Chickpeas, Tahini, Oil, Garlic, Lime, Roast beetroot  Just putting it in an airtight container and popping it in the fridge should be fine right?", "completion": "PA Dutch resident reporting: I'm going to go ahead and say these people meowing about beets turning your hummus faster are full of bovid posterior extrusion. We literally put beets and eggs in vats of highly acidic sugar water here and let them sit a week for fun, and THEN begin to eat on them. I've routinely reused that brine a second time, keeping it a full 3 weeks before discarding. I've been doing that for 40 years and have never once gotten sick from it. With apt lemon/lime juice, your hummus with beets will store just fine for at least a week (probably longer but let's be reasonable) so long as you did your due diligence in washing your hands and containers appropriately.   At the end of the day, hummus is just a starchy simple emulsion, little different form a salad dressing, so you can freeze it just fine for longer storage. If it separates upon thawing, put in back in the food processor for a quick spin and it should come back together."}
{"prompt": "Quit my job as a Quality Engineer??? There is no point in \"sticking it out\" and no this is not a \"valuable experience\" for transferring into other engineering roles. Nothing I am involved in or do relates to other engineering roles. The job is simply not an engineering role in my opinion. So whats the point of continuing to deal with the most uninteresting, dull, and annoying problems everyday?", "completion": "I find it strange that you say Quality Engineering has nothing to do with other engineering roles.  What do you spend your day doing?  If you're doing QA inspections all day, and putting stickers on thousands of identical products, then I would tend to agree with you. BUT if you are in the position to inform design and process decisions, that would be a very rewarding role IMO.  The biggest problems most folks have with quality roles, and quality initiatives, is that we don't understand the importance of doing quality at the beginning, instead of the end of a process.  Make, sort, and cull would be a soul-crushing experience."}

A real one using real scientific measurements. Pic an area and set up a grid of trail cameras. Have a drone with heat vision. Actual do multiple mini studies too.  Observation: continuous accounts of a large animal that is on its hind legs  Hypotheses: An animal,such as a great ape can sustain a small population in [pacific north west].  Methods: estimate by what a gorilla needs to sustain itself (food,water, etc). Look at viable food sources  Use GIS data for different animal populations and when berries ripen though out the year.  Next step in the study is to make a map of the most sightings, find out the densest area, and make a grid of the trail cams I mentioned.  Observation: multiple reports of large ape, does it actually exist?  Methods: tons of trail cameras running for two months. Use GIS data results from last study to strategically place the cameras. Do a few drone flybys (really high up as not to spook animals) and record heat signatures in relations to cameras. Once retrieval of cameras is ready, have a bunch of scientists do a sweep of the area, marking down and photographing signs of any wildlife.  Analysis: count the number of animals on the trail cameras, categorize him by species, and family. Put any unknown in a certain category. Look at signs made by animals, and categorize it. How much is unexplained? Does the drone footage align with trail cameras and the unexplained?   Conclusion: The hypothesis was supported, there was an unknown large animal out there.  They hypothesis was rejected, no significant data pointing to that.  Double benefit of this study:  Have a species count for the area and what habitats they like. Useful in wildlife management  Edit:  I\u2019m talking setting up 3 trail cameras pointed at themselves to get all angles, in sections of 200 ft grid that span a mile or so (distance can vary!).

{"prompt": "If someone performs selfless acts because they feel good for doing them, are they selfish? My friend continuously brings up this question and I've been wondering about some common philosophical viewpoints on the matter.  Any answer would be appreciated. Thanks!", "completion": "It seems like an unconscious assumption that the amount of good to come from an act is somehow finite. I don't see why that would have to be the case. In acting selfless or kind for others, to say we ourselves should not derive any pleasure from it is to artificially separate ourselves from others. Be kind to others. Be kind to yourself. Treating yourself better to the detriment of others is problematic. Treating yourself with the same integrity and kindness as you treat others doesn't seem so to me."}

Over the weekend it took 1 NYT columnist to remove Pepe le pew from polite society. This Cartoon Skunk has not been culturally important in what 10-15 years?  Yet he was canceled all the same.   The reason why conservatives hate cancel culture isnt because they necessarily disagree with whom is being canceled( i thought pepe was a goner years ago) but because only select individuals decide who is allowed to stay and who is allowed to go. lets take Future for example, one of the most popular rappers alive right now and certainly of 2015-2019.  one of his most popular songs is called \"mask off\" the lyrics in the chorus are \"Percocet, Molly Percocet\".   my problem with cancel culture is if we agree that Pepe is contributing to rape culture surely future is contributing to the opioid epidemic no? but the gatekeepers do not ever hold rappers  to the same degree that they do this cartoon skunk and if you ever try to bring it up they dismiss you.

{"prompt": "CMV: it would be morally acceptable to eat lab grown human meat So, the idea grosses me out, but morally I can't see why it would be wrong.   I have long believed that eating animals is morally wrong because it is inherently cruel to kill living beings (obviously including humans). When I first heard about lab grown meat, the prospect was exciting because it removed the moral conflict from eating something that is delicious - burgers, chicken nuggets, etc.  Recently though the idea came to me that this technology, should it mature enough, would likely be capable of growing meat from non-traditional food animals. Picture lab grown hippo or badger or hummingbird. And also....humans. There definitely will be people who want this and I struggle to see why it would be wrong.   No humans would be harmed to make it. As long as the initial cells used to create it were healthy, I don't think disease would be an issue. The only problem I see is an intangible \"ick\" factor. Help me out here.", "completion": "Not a moral issue necessarily, but it could be a public health concern. Even grown in a lab, the human meat would presumably be susceptible to human disease and prions (an issue in some societies with ritualistic cannibalisms of the dead), they are still just human cells after all, so could potentially pose a risk as a disease vector."}
{"prompt": "How do I make the most of my undergraduate research? I feel like the time I'm putting in is worthless right now", "completion": "It's gonna be hard to give a solid answer if you don't provide more specifics in the OP, but I'll try to give some general ideas. I'm going to assume, until told otherwise, that you're working 5-10 hours in a week working in a STEM field for a grad student in a lab basically showing up and doing whatever they tell you to, which is usually some fairly mundane task - that is, you're not getting much in the way of mentoring and doing very little in the way of data analysis or technical writing/communication. I'm basing these assumptions on your feeling that your time is worthless and what I see as being fairly common practice for undergrad researchers in STEM fields.  * The first thing you can do is bring up your concerns directly to your grad or postdoc supervisor, or to your professor/PI. They may assuming or be used to seeing that undergrads aren't interested in a bigger investment into the work (which is often a fair assumption, a lot of undergrads just want the line on their resume/CV more than the intellectual engagement with research as a discipline). By sharing your concerns, they may be able to give you more worthwhile ways to spend your time. I do feel like most PIs at least do want to help and make sure that you benefit from your time with them - if you're benefitting from the experience, the research overall benefits as well, and it makes the professor look good when students who worked under him go on to be successful later in their careers.  * Read papers, on your own time if necessary. Start with papers put out recently by the group you work with, but look at the papers that are cited as well as very recent work by other researchers which cites the work done by your group. Work to build a decent knowledge base about the field you're working in that can help you understand what is being done in the lab.  * Ask questions in the lab, e.g. why is X done in a certain way, or why are you varying Y but not Z. The more questions you ask (without pestering your coworkers, of course!) the more opportunities you have to learn.  * If nothing else is successful, look for a different group and apply to work with them instead. Depending on the PI's policies, you may be able to continue working with your current group while also working with a new group, but I would recommend making the choice between one or the other so that you can devote your full time and attention to one project and get the most out of it.  * In terms of more \"practical\" value, the best thing you can get from a research experience in terms of your resume or CV is to have your name on a publication, especially if you want to apply to graduate schools. Another big plus is if you can present at an undergraduate research conference such as the NCRC or NCUR (link is for 2017 conference). If you want to pursue these things, make sure to talk to your supervisor and/or PI as soon as possible so they can work with you to make this happen."}

{"prompt": "What did Foucault mean when he said that mythological resources of the 19th century were found in the 2nd law of thermodynamics? This is written in \"Of Other Spaces:  Utopias and Heterotopias\".

The nineteenth century found its essential mythological resources in the second principle of thermodynamics. The present epoch will perhaps be above all the epoch of space. We are in the epoch of simultaneity: we are in the epoch of juxtaposition, the epoch of the near and far, of the side-by-side, of the dispersed.\"", "completion": ">The great obsession of the nineteenth century was, as we know, history:  Hegel's dialectic influenced lots of people to believe that history was simply unfolding, and the world was on a set path on which it would continue to resolve its internal contradictions, working towards a stable and steady state \u2014 its 'fate'.  (Note the assumption that this involves: that the world didn't continue to change despite all the 'resolving' that humankind was up to; in other words, this interpretation of 'history' rested on an assumption that the world was simply static, 'dead' even, ready for reconfiguration by humankind however it pleased. This is reflected in the colonialism of the age; even though Marx is just as guilty of this interpretation of history (see below), his claim that the economic 'base' of gold-standard capitalism] creates the ideological 'superstructure' [of interpreting the world as a lifeless treasure ready for the plundering] seems accurate in this case.)   > with its themes of development and of suspension, of crisis, and cycle, themes of the ever-accumulating past, with its great preponderance of dead men and the menacing glaciation of the world.  You can see this interpretation of history in Marx's [inevitable collapse of capitalism in the developed countries of Western Europe. You can see it in Alfred Marshall's proclamation that the price of a good sits at the stable equilibrium between the two curves describing its supply and its demand. I think you can even see it in Gottlob Frege's _Basic Laws of Arithmetic_ and Russell and Whitehead's _Principia Mathematica_, which were attempts to ground all mathematical endeavor in logic, and thus 'glaciate' it as a crystalline superstructure atop a simple static base.  > The nineteenth century found its essential mythological resources in the second principle of thermodynamics.  The 2nd principle is that total entropy always increases. It's 'fate' on a molecular level.  > The present epoch will perhaps be above all the epoch of space. We are in the epoch of simultaneity: we are in the epoch of juxtaposition, the epoch of the near and far, of the side-by-side, of the dispersed.  In the 20th century, people had started to realize that there wasn't simply one static dead world ready to plunder, but many different interpretations of the world (although we still seem pretty keen on thinking that it's adequately dead to plunder, even though climate change's bite at least has made some of us reconsider this position). You can see this in Wittgenstein's famous quote about the lion, claiming that the lion's vastly different interpretation of the world from ours renders the lion's hypothetical speech nevertheless incomprehensible. You can see it in Roland Barthes' _The Death of the Author_ essay, which basically claims that by the time whatever I write here hits your (yes, you) comprehension, it doesn't matter what on earth I intended to say with this, because you as the person interpreting it are a different person to me, with a different set of experiences and a different set of assumptions and understandings derived from those experiences. In summary, in the 20th century, people realized that there wasn't one world hurtling towards its stable fate in which all contradictions were resolved, but instead that there is (as of writing) 7.753 billion different worlds living simultaneously juxtaposed against each other."}
{"prompt": "[Florida] I found out that my younger sister was sent away to a religious camp for her sexuality by my evangelical parents, who lied and took money from me (I believe) to fund it. I am furious. I posted this in r/relationships but I was told to post here. I live in Florida and so do my parents. This rest of this is a direct copy paste of what I posted there.  I posted a thing here a two years ago that helped me with an uncomfortable situation involving a boss at work and it helped me save a good friendship and my job, so hopefully you guys can help me again with a much much more serious situation. I didn't remember that account so I made a new one. I need to give a little background to explain the situation. This will probably be long. I'm shitty at writing so please bare with me.  I work as a computer engineer and live away from my parents. I moved out when I was 18, not because we had a particularly distant relationship, but because I was very hungry for independence and I didn't want to go to college like they wanted me to. I fell in love with programming and got a job a month after I graduated, and I've done that since. I am extremely frugal, and I now make about 70k a year after taxes (go mr. money mustache). Both my parents are in traditional white collar jobs that make significantly more money than I do, and they are horrific with money.  When I was growing up my parents were semi-religious (church on easter and christmas type of deal) and not particularly invested in it or politics. Somewhere in the last three or four years they became interested in it, and in the last year in particular (regarding the last elecion especially) they have become some of the most religious and overfocused political people i've ever seen. I have tried distancing myself from this by refusing to talk about these issues over the phone at all. I could not disagree more with them. I think they have some very hateful views, but I've chosen not to engage them on it.  Growing up I was not close to my younger sister, mainly because of our age gap. However she has grown up and is very pleasant to speak to. We have spoken on the phone daily (I speak to mom and dad much less frequently) since she was around 14. I have not been exposed to to much of this because I intentionally tell both sides I don't want to talk about their drama (although I am generally clear with my sister that I agree with her, but I don't want to badmouth her parents). My sister is a lesbian, which I have no issue with whatsoever, and my parents do not (or did not) know and would immediately be against. We talked about this a quite often. My sister also has political views completely at odd with my parents (she was in trouble for not supporting their favorite political candidate, you can probably guess who) but I encouraged her to swallow it and suck it up at home for her safety and sanity. She mentioned a few times in the last two months about wanting to come out to them and I highly highly discouraged it. I have heard both of my parents approve of a pastor who disowned his gay son and similar stories. I didn't want them to do that to her. I have offered to let her live with me when she turns 18 but imagined that being in the future. I made her promise not to do that and she did.  On her 16th birthday, she came out to them. I was a little angry with her over the phone (I didn't curse or scream or anything, but I was annoyed, but with sympathy for her position. I did chide her a bit, which I acknowledge was dumb.) She was extremely mad at me and didn't call me for four days, which was a long time for us not to speak.  We spoke afterwards and I was much better, but things weren't going well. They didn't kick her out but weren't speaking to her at all. Literally she was screaming at them and they just quietly went into their rooms, not saying a word.  I offered to speak to them for her and she begged me not to, so I did not, against my better judgement.  My Dad, a week later, called me over the phone. He said that he was sick and needed emergency money to have a procedure He begged me \"not to tell\" mom or my sister. He needed about 20 grand. I had refused them money in the past for a car loan and made it clear that I wasn't giving them money, but I did for this, cautious but ultimately trusting him not to lie about his own potential death. I disagreed with him about a lot of things but he had always been so steadfast about the importance of honesty the thought of him lying about something like that seemed ridiculous and I felt guilty for even thinking that.  About another week after that, my sister stopped calling me. I thought she was mad again for some reason but she didn't answer at all. I was worried. I called my parents and asked about her after about a week and they said she was being moody (I thought they thought I didn't know about her sexuality or what was going on).  I checked my Facebook that night and I read an days old message from one of her friends that explained that she had been trying to reach me and that my sister was taken from her house into a van and driven off by men in a program with her and my parents there before kicking the friend out of the house. Her friend visited my parents house several times and they eventually told her they sent her to a religious program. She didn't get the name.  I called up my father, and he denied it twice before admitting it after a long talk. I was so angry. They seriously have these religious camps that parents can send teens to anytime without committing a crime forever. I didn't think it had anything to do with the money, but I looked it up after that and found out that these programs are generally very expensive. I called him up again and he admitted that's where the money went. I demanded that he let her out and he told me it was his money. I told him I'd never speak to him again and he just ignored me. I try calling him up every few hours for the last several days when I found out and they ignore almost all of my calls.  He intentionally didn't tell me the name of the facility or camp, but I've done reading and these are almost always dangerous places. I don't even know if she is in the US anymore. People die and get brainwashed at these places. I feel so guilty for giving them the ability to do this. I don't know the name of the camp, and I did technically give them the money.  My only recourse at this point is to go tell everyone in their neighborhood what they did. I saw a facebook post they made about sending my sister to a snooty christian boarding school and that is NOT what they did. I called the school they posted and she isn't going there. They are very connected to the church/suburban town community and I think it would threaten them to have their image splattered with the truth.  I would completely disown them now if it wouldn't completely destroy my chances of getting her out. I am at a loss. Please help me.  tl;dr: My parents lied to me and took money claiming it was for an illness only to turn around and use it to send my sister to a camp because she came out. They are ignoring my calls.

This amount of money is \"get an attorney\" level, as the max for small claims in Florida is $5,000. The advantage of getting a lawyer, is that he may be able to work out a settlement where you agree to drop the suit in exchange for guardianship of your sister, or some other positive outcome that you would consider worth 20 grand.  As u/Zanctmao mentioned, you do not want to do this on your own as extortion is a very fine line to walk. \"Give me guardianship of my sister or I'll sue you for the $20,000 may be criminal extortion, whereas sueing for $20,000 but offering a settlement of some non-monetary form might be OK."}

How long exactly that is depends on which version of the Tolkien's Legendarium you're reading.  In one version, it would be somewhere between 50-100 years before their achieved their adult bodies. After that though, they do basically stop aging. Tolkien wrote in one of his essays about it, and then his son published it in *Morgoth's Ring*.  >*The Eldar grew in bodily form slower than Men, but in mind more swiftly. They learned to speak before they were one year old; and in the same time they learned to walk and to dance, for their wills came soon to the mastery of their bodies. Nonetheless there was less difference between the two Kindreds, Elves and Men, in early youth; and a man who watched elf-children at play might well have believed that they were the children of Men, of some fair and happy people. For in their early days elf-children delighted still in the world about them, and the fire of their spirit had not consumed them, and the burden of memory was still light upon them.*   >   >*This same watcher might indeed have wondered at the small limbs and stature of these children, judging their age by their skill in words and grace in motion. For at the end of the third year mortal children began to outstrip the Elves, hastening on to a full stature while the Elves lingered in the first spring of childhood.* ***Children of Men might reach their full height while Eldar of the same age were still in body like to mortals of no more than seven years. Not until the fiftieth year did the Eldar attain the stature and shape in which their lives would afterwards endure, and for some a hundred years would pass before they were full-grown.***  Another version is thoroughly covered in *The Nature of Middle-earth*. It operates under a complete different timescale though and gives childhood duration roughly 2880 years in Aman or 200 years in Middle-Earth.  >*1) Elves married late in Aman (usually).* ***They became adult at life-age 20, but that = 20 VY = 2,880***\\*; but they remained very young and vigorous (and youthful in mind and interests) so that often they did not wed until they were 200 life-years old or nearly that: sc. when 28,800 Sun-years old!\\*   >   >*2) But under the Sun (outside Varda\u2019s Domes) all the Eldar had quickened in growth, though they had not lost (at first) much of their steadfastness in vigour and health at that point.* ***They therefore reached maturity 10 times quicker or became 20 when only 200 \\sun-\\]years old***\\*; they then maintained this vigour, ageing only at the rate of 100 years = 1 life-year.\\*  If you're interested, there was a recent [post in r/tolkienfans which covered this pretty well."}
{"prompt": "Is there a particular stigma to being a philosopher and having strong religious views, even if one's philosophy is distinct from them? Is medieval philosophy not taken as seriously for this reason?? Admittedly, I've only had some graduate study, but my perception is that philosophers with strong religious views are somewhat sidelined.  I don't just mean in academia either; after reading Maimonides *Guide for the Perplexed* and looking for secondary literature, I was a bit disappointed that nearly everything published was in Jewish studies rather than philosophy.   This is despite the fact that it seemed to me you could accept a lot of Maimonides' metaphysics without being committed to any of his religious views (e.g. At the end of Book I, he talks a great deal about how being able to imagine something is not relevant to whether or not that thing actually exists [which apparently is something some theologians thought at the time?], and has some interesting thoughts about ontology as to how it relates to imagination and observation of empirical fact)  Based on the philosophical education that *I* received at least, we tended to talk a great deal about Plato and Aristotle, after which philosophy was apparently dead for the next 1500 years, whereupon Descartes appaears on the scene and philosophy rises from the grave.  I can't help but notice that most philosophers during this period tended to couch their philosophy in religious allegory (e.g. Avicenna, Maimonides, Scotus, etc) even if their religious views were only one part of a larger worldview.  The professors I know who specialize in history of philosophy don't seem to know a great deal about a period of between 1,000 and 1,500 years.    So do religious philosophers get pooh-poohed?  And if so, is it justified? (e.g. I could see an argument that people who have rather strong biases should be taken rather less seriously than people who don't, but I think that might presuppose that their religious conclusions are informing their philosophy rather than the other way around)  Is there another reason that medieval philosophy is not studied nearly as much that I am just unaware of?  (I also know that Catholic philosophy and academia tends to be its own insular field of study, but I'm not sure if that's by choice)", "completion": "Are you asking if contemporary philosophers take religious philosophers from the past seriously? The answer is an unambiguous yes, for instance Descartes, Plato and Aristotle are taken very much taken seriously, and these Philosophers religious beliefs were not at all unconnected from their Philosophy.   I think your actual question is 'why isn't medieval philosophy very prominent?' but there is no way Avicenna is somehow 'more religious' than Kant."}
{"prompt": "CMV: Pet ownership should be strictly regulated and licensed; a prospective owner should be required to demonstrate their ability to care for an animal before a pet license is granted and an animal is purchased or (ideally) adopted. Hi folks.  I think it's commonly acknowledged that many pet owners are not fit to properly care for their animal.  Quite aside from active abuse, there is significant passive abuse that has been normalised in western cultures, e.g.:  * Leaving co-dependent pets locked alone in small spaces for much of the day * Providing poor quality, excessive or insufficiently varied diets * Providing insufficient mental or physical exercise * Raising animals in conditions that are antithetical to their natural environment (this is a little subjective, perhaps) * Selling or giving away co-dependent pets when they no longer \"fit for purpose\"  So my dangerous idea, that seems to be quite unpopular amongst everyone I've talked to, is that pet ownership should be regulated and licensed in much the same way as human adoption. It seems odd to me that we bring these animals into our lives to raise them, essentially, as our children, but we don't seem to confer on them the same living conditions as we would a child.  This view does not necessarily cover service or working animals, that's a whole different matter.  Why do I want my view changed? Two reasons:  1. I have locked horns with some of my pet-owning friends about this; their argument being that such regulations would restrict their freedom to own a thing that they want (which is precisely the point). I want to understand where they're coming from, and either they don't have the patience to articulate it in terms I can understand, or I don't have the patience to understand how they've articulated it. I'm not sure which. 2. I would really love to get a dog or cat as a companion animal, but as a city dwelling, working single person, I feel very far from being able to morally do so considering the above. If it were my job to set the terms on which a \"pet license\" is granted, my current lifestyle (and that of most city-dwelling single folks) would not pass muster. **That said, please keep in mind that my CMV appeal is about the wider issue of pet ownership, not my view that I shouldn't get a dog**.  Thanks for reading, I'll try to engage as best I can. :)", "completion": "The argument that anything should be licensed is a very slippery slope and most people don\u2019t seem to realize how one simple thing like this could snowball into more government control, which to anyone that knows any history, is a bad thing"}
{"prompt": "eli5: what exactly is nausea, and how do certain things like ginger, Pepto Bismol, etc. help relieve it?", "completion": "Nausea is one of the internal senses, a feeling of the need or urge to vomit, similar to the feeling of the need to pee. Nausea is a very non-specific symptom, meaning that it can be caused by a lot of different conditions and in a lot of different ways.  One common means by which it can be triggered is via the 5-HT3 receptor, found in the neurons of the vagus nerve that connects the gut to the brain. Many anti-nausea drugs, like ondansetron/Zofran (the current gold-standard anti-nausea medication), target this receptor and in the process block the gut from sending that signal to the brain.  Pepto-Bismol works in a few different ways to reduce irritation in the gut, which in turn reduces the distress signals sent by the gut to the brain. It can directly kill common food-poisoning bacteria, it reduces the acidity of the stomach both directly and through acting sort of like aspirin (which does the same thing), etc. But the exact mechanism isn't known."}
{"prompt": "A hard white bread brand recommendation for my french toast casserole? I'm making a french toast casserole for Easter Sunday breakfast. I've only made it once before and the results weren't exactly as I had anticipated. I used Sara Lee's Texas Toast and the result was a very soft, malleable french toast casserole. Almost like a bread pudding. I think the soft Sara Lee bread over-absorbed the egg mixture making it a little soggy. I still want to use a white bread, but I want to use a brand that is harder, not as soft as the Sara Lee. Any recommendations?  Here's the recipe:  **French Toast Casserole with Streusel**  *For the Streusel:*  * 2 cups packed light brown sugar * 1 cup chopped pecans * \u00bd cups salted butter, sliced (1 stick) * 4 tsp ground cinnamon  *For the Casserole:*  * 12 to 13 cups cubed Bread * 8 large eggs * 3 cups whole milk * \u00bd cup white sugar * \u00bd tsp salt * 4 tsp good vanilla extract *  Syrup for serving  *Directions*  1. Make the Streusel: Combine all streusel ingredients in a bowl, mixing well until resembles chunky, damp sand. Cover and keep in fridge to chill.  2. Grease a 9x13 baking dish with butter on bottom and up sides. Place 12 cups of bread cubes in dish. In a large bowl, combine eggs, milk, sugar, salt, and vanilla, whisking to thoroughly incorporate. Pour egg mixture evenly and slowly over the bread cubes. Gently toss to ensure even coating of all bread cubes. If there seems to be too much excess liquid, add another cup of bread cubes until liquid seems mostly soaked up (there will be a thin layer of excess liquid at the bottom, which is ok.)  3. Cover and place in fridge to chill overnight, if making ahead of time (gently toss soaked bread cubes again before baking.)  4. Preheat oven to 350F. Sprinkle chilled streusel evenly over the top of casserole.  5. Bake for 45-60 minutes, or until topping is nicely browned and bubbly. If it starts looking too browned at the 45 minute mark, loosely tent with foil and continue baking as needed.  6. Allow to cool about 10-15 minutes, and serve warm with maple syrup.", "completion": "Could always go with challah and let it go a little stale, it's butta."}

{"prompt": "Does a bearing need to be secured to its housing? I work for a pretty young company with a lot of great designers/engineers, but we\u2019re a small team and are still working to create our standard OEM assembly\u2019s.   I\u2019m trying to settle a dispute with an engineer and sales manager about a design we employed recently. I\u2019m pretty confident my engineers are being lazy and my lack of title is making me fall on deaf ears (Non-degreed \u201csales engineer\u201d)  I worked as an industrial tech for around 5 years. In that time, I replaced countless bearings, shafts and housings. It was always a good excuse to get out the big hammer.   What was instilled upon me was; your inner and outer race MUST be secured to the shaft and housing. Whether this is a pillow block style bearing or a press fit housing, or even a punch damaging the housing enough for an emergency fix, the principal remained the same. I remember us having a housing redone and polished just be sure the fit was secure, as an unfinished fit allows loosening.   We made a design for the outer race that is 2 parts which bolt together to compress the outer race. I sent a video of this not being done property because with the bolts tight, the bearing wiggles freely.   I was told this wasn\u2019t a problem.   I followed up with saying that we should be using bearing retainer on the inner race+shaft and that the outer must be secured in my experience.   This is a small conveyor that will be belt driven.   I was told \u201cThe tension on the belt holds the outer race against the housing and keeps it from spinning.\u201c  This is incorrect, right? This would exert loads on the bearing (possibly minor?) in directions they\u2019re not designed for, in addition to simply going against design principles.   This isn\u2019t a hill I want to die on - but I also don\u2019t want to watch us ship 50 of these like this.   Thoughts? Advice?", "completion": "Mechanical engineer here. Yes you want to restrict axial movement of the inner and outer race.  The bearing in your description can be walked off the shaft (or out of the housing) by the belt. Belts aren't precision PT components, so they will walk on you. Also, your shaft is rotating, meaning your outer race needs to be held, can be done multiple ways but most common would be a light press fit, but also needs a positive contact retainer.  Also the inner race should be held to the shaft using set screws or something similar.  Hope this helps."}

{"prompt": "I have sole custody of my 1 year old son, and my ex-gf has been contacting my health insurance company trying to get info from them regarding my son\u2019s coverage. They have given her at least some information that I know of. Are they allowed to give her this information without my consent? (OHIO). I have a son with a crazy ex-gf, who has put both me and my little boy through absolute hell over the last few months/years. Thankfully, my little man is one tough dude and has not only survived, but has zero health of developmental issues. It\u2019s honestly a miracle; there\u2019s no other way to explain it. My ex hasn\u2019t had custody at all since roughly the time my son was 2 months old, and he\u2019s now 13 months. She has visitation with him twice a week for 4 hours at a time, and outside of those hours, he is with me always. I\u2019ve handled all Dr visits and literally everything medically related. She\u2019s shown up to most of the appointments, but that\u2019s pretty much where her involvement ends with stuff like that. Well, until recently. For some unknown reason, over the last few weeks she started asking questions about my health insurance.  The only information I gave her was the name of the insurance company, nothing else. A week or 2 after that, she randomly started ranting and raving at me one day, trying to tell me that she \u201cfound out\u201d that I don\u2019t have health insurance for myself or my son. Since she\u2019s literally crazy, I just ignored it, even though she\u2019d bring it up every time I saw her. The one thing I did say to her was that as long as the kid is going to see doctors when he needs to, it really doesn\u2019t concern her whether or not I even have insurance, being that she isn\u2019t the one that\u2019s paying for everything. I still have no idea why she all the sudden cares about any of this.   Anyhow, a couple days ago (Friday), I received a voicemail from my insurance company. The message started with \u201cHello, crazy-ex\u2019s-name, this is ____ insurance, following up with you on your inquiry from yesterday\u201d.  So they called my phone and left a message addressed to her. I obviously don\u2019t know if the ex was pretending that her and I are together and share my phone number, or if the insurance company somehow mistakenly called me when they meant to call her. Either way, the voicemail was clearly directed at my ex, calling her by her first name, and also later in the message referencing my son\u2019s name.  The message goes on to state the effective date of my son\u2019s coverage, and then asks my ex to call back so they can contact my employer\u2019s HR team in order to have insurance cards mailed directly to her. The rep also stated that they would be able to take my ex\u2019s address and list it as an alternative address on the policy so that my ex will receive any and all future correspondence regarding the baby.  The rep then left a reference number for her to call back, and that was the end of the message. By the time I listened to the voicemail it was too late to call them back myself, so I haven\u2019t been able to talk to anyone yet.   My questions are: 1) is my ex allowed to call my insurance company like this being that she doesn\u2019t have custody of the child? 2) is the insurance company actually allowed to give her any of the information that they already have and/or do any of the things they\u2019ve said in the voicemail that they would do?  I do not at all like the idea of my ex having access to any of my information whatsoever, and I would seriously prefer that she isn\u2019t given any information about my son either. She\u2019ll do nothing but cause problems, whatever they may be. Not to mention that I really don\u2019t want her dealing with my employer\u2019s HR department. I can already imagine it now, having to answer to my HR department because this psycho decided to tell them some crazy story to try to get me fired.

{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old Why does time pass slower the faster we move? I always hear scientists say it, but there never are any good explanations. How can moving faster effect biological processes within our bodies like cell division (mitosis)?", "completion": "Because the speed of light is constant.    Let's make a clock.  Now since we know the speed of light is constant, we can do so by bouncing a light pulse between two mirrors and counting how many times it bounces.  Every X bounces is 1 second.  Not the handiest clock, but we need it to explain the rest.  We stick this clock in a spaceship and have the spaceship fly at 3/4s the speed of light past us.  In 1 second we should still see that beam of light in the clock bounce up and down X times inside the clock.  BUT in that same time those mirrors have moved 3/4s of 1 lightsecond as well!  So through Pythagoras, in the time you in the ship see 1 second on the lightclock, I see your light pulse move a longer distance:  sqrt of (1 squared + 3/4 squared) lightseconds, which is 1.25 light seconds.  Normally this would not be a problem BUT we know from experiments that the light speed is constant.     In what I measure as 1 second on my clock, I measure as 1.25 seconds on your clock flying past.  The speed of light is constant.  That vertical distance is constant.  That means the only remaining variable, time itself must have changed.  When 1 second passes for me, I see 1.25 seconds pass for you.  Or vice versa when 1 second passes for you, only 1/1.25 seconds have passed for me.  Hence your TIME itself has slowed down.  Tl;DR: Because the speed of light is constant, time cannot be constant."}

It was all framed as unlikely and he said if my work was used id be notified automatically.  Anyway that was 3 years ago, and I was ruminating on how that professor shafted me on that project/degree and how the only good thing to come out of it was a thesis I was very proud of. I remembered the discussion re the PhD student, and had a Google to see what if anything he ever published.  So I found his thesis, and to be blunt, he was using some of my work, and gave no credit or reference. It's a 300 page PhD so I didn't check it all, but the item I found is a photo I took using an electron microscope. It's of some samples I had prepared, and processed in a very specific way, and it's a distinctive image, there is no doubt that's my sample, I remember being like \"fuck yes I nailed this one\".    He describes it like \"fig x, typical example of sample processed in x way\", and lists it similarly in the table of figures, which also contains author credits for many of the other figures, and it is implied that the figures he doesn't credit are his own.   Now as mentioned these guys kinda screwed me once already, and I know for a fact that they wouldn't hesitate to shaft me if they caught me stealing work. Plus on top of that it feels shit man, it's my work and it's been published as somebody else's. Plus it's basically against one of the core tennets of modern science. I am not happy.  So I guess my question is what now? Do I have any grounds for recourse? My thesis was never published, but it exists, in my and the universities records, and it clearly contains that image, and it clearly predates the PhD by ages.  They could have easily just credited me and notified me, and I would have been fucking pumped, but instead this deceptive shit, plus they could have used one of their own images to illustrate a typical example of that process, but they used mine, because its an excellent image, because I worked my ass off to make sure it was.", "completion": "I'm surprised to see commenters saying essentially that this isn't a big deal or isn't plagiarism. It is a big deal, and it is plagiarism. A dissertation is a published work, and that author passed off your work as his own.   (Does it happen all the time? Yes. Are you going to receive any benefits coming to you from that particular instance? No. Will the offender be punished? No. But that doesn't mean it isn't wrong and doesn't sting, as you note.)  A similar situation happened to me (a figure used in a published work without credit), and I brought it up with my advisor, who apologized and was clearly embarrassed. That's why that advisor and I are still on good terms\u2014because they *didn't* make some excuse about a student's data being \"lab property\" (in the sense of being some type of work-for-hire that doesn't require citation). Industry work is done for hire. Academic work is done for credit and sometimes credit alone.  Why not write an email to that person and your shared advisor and say exactly what you said\u2014that you are disappointed because this action violates one of the core tenets of modern science\u2014and that you expect to be a coauthor on any future work to which you made an essential contribution and to be acknowledged in cases where you contributed a supporting figure, such as this micrograph. I suspect writing such an email (make it professional and succinct\u2014take the high road) will make you feel better."}
{"prompt": "What is the worst job you could get as a mechanical engineer? That's the question, this is just background. When I was looking for jobs, I had a hard time finding a comprehensive list of different types of engineering under the umbrella of mechanical engineering with descriptions of work and work environment. I knew I wanted to avoid project engineering, but I inadvertently ended up doing exactly that. My job entails writing work procedures in an office.

{"prompt": "How to tell my employer that I am quitting after only 2 weeks of working? Will I be blacklisted? For some context, I recently moved to another state for a engineering job (1 year contract) at a really big pharmaceutical company. The people here are very friendly and treat me well so far but I just got another engineering job offer (full time permanent) that pays significantly more at my home state where I\u2019m originally from.  At first I didn\u2019t like the idea of quitting my current job since I had already moved across 4 states to get here but the more I thought about it, the more I want to move back home and take this offer. Not only are the pay and benefits way better, but all my friends, family, and even gf is back home which means I wouldn\u2019t have to do long distance.  I want to tell my employer that I want to quit but I\u2019m not sure the best way to say it. Should I be honest and say I am quitting because I got another offer at a different company? Or, should I lie and say I have to move home because of family emergencies and complications? I don\u2019t want to leave on a bad note and ruin any future chances of potential employment with this company (blacklisted), especially with how nice and friendly everyone is. Not to mention they are one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world. Any help or advice is greatly appreciated.", "completion": "Reputable companies won't blacklist candidates for petty stuff like that.

{"prompt": "Is there such a thing as alternative or research prisons? I'm thinking something along the lines of a prison where they try out different correctional practices, maybe research what works for best for rehabilitation and reducing recitivism. And if not, is there research on what works, and is it being implemented anywhere?", "completion": "The research aspect would be tricky. Prisoners are considered a vulnerable population for research and extra safegaurds are needed for ethical approval of studies to make sure partipants are not coerced. So a prison designed to research new methods might have difficulty with getting approved by an IRB."}
{"prompt": "CMV: Piracy is not morally equivalent to stealing, and \"intellectual property\" is not morally equivalent to \"physical property\" If I go into a Walmart, and grab a loaf of bread, slip it under my hoodie and run out of the store with it, what are the consequences of my actions?  Well, Walmart doesn't have the bread anymore, and they thus can't sell it. So Walmart will lose a sale on bread at the very least. If stealing bread was too easy, Walmart might never sell bread, so the threat of stealing forces Walmart to pay for guards to protect their stuff and prevent stealing, and creates an environment where Walmart wants to vote in politicians who will create a police force that will discourage stealing.  But consider a hypothetical. What if I had a sci-fi gadget that let me duplicate matter down to the atom? I walk into Walmart, point it at a piece of bread and double it, walking out with the copy that I made.  Did I steal anything from Walmart?  Well, the original bread is still there. Walmart can still sell it. And while my piece of duplicate bread is causally dependent on a supply chain of farmers and shippers, the proximal cause of the bread existing is me creating a copy of it.  What's the difference here? Well, most things that we talk about \"stealing\" involve scarcity and exclusion.  Our society is very wealthy, but we don't produce infinite bread with zero human effort. We don't have a matter duplication machine, so we still have to grow all of our food and all of the people involved only get their money if people actually exchange bread for cash.  The only obvious thing is that our current economic model would be a comical mismatch for a world where matter duplicators were widely available.  For all practical purposes computer data works like the matter replicator in modern times. Once I have the bits representing a song, it is essentially effortless and costless to reproduce an exact copy, and a million copies isn't far behind that.  And yet, music producers insist on keeping an economic system designed for scarcity applied to a part of the economy where there is no actual scarcity. It's like if the government outlawed duplicating food, because it was stealing from farmers. As long as we could make mutually beneficial and consensual social arrangements where some people made food, and everyone got the food, we wouldn't need to outlaw duplicating food.  I think that we have the business model of media distribution backwards in society, in light of the fact that distribution approaches being costless for digital products.  Where does a consumer pay into the production cycle in the current system? At distribution - the \"easiest\" part of the process. Essentially, content producers get no new money until after a product is made and distributed, and so production companies need to pay for new projects with the profits of older products.  But what if we paid into the system in a different part of the production cycle?  We have already seen some success with alternative models like Kickstarter and Patreon.  Right now, we \"need\" big studios, because they have the money sloshing around to make projects happen, since all the artists need to be paid while they're making a product, and the studio won't start making money until it is complete.  But what if crowdfunding replaced all of that? Content creators could be paid ahead of time, wouldn't need big studios with lots of prior profit to make new projects, and would be fully paid for their works and thus not care about people distributing their works without permission.  I think that we live in a world comparable to the one where matter duplicators exist, but entrenched interests prevent them from being widely used. In such a world, I don't think it is morally wrong to duplicate food - as long as farmers are able to make a living, a few free riders don't matter, and it is the perverse incentives keeping a bad system in place that make the \"stealing\" a problem in the first place.  It is better to recognize when goods are scarce, and when they aren't and create an appropriate system for each of those kinds of goods in society.", "completion": "I feel like you\u2019re trying to fit a triangle piece in as circular hole. You recognize it required investment to create intellectual property, what baffles me is why you don\u2019t think the people who make that investment should be able to recoup that investment down the line. Take your bread duplication for example, if such a technology were to exist, who would actually produce the bread Walmart would sell? It\u2019s a 100% loss scenario because everyone would duplicate the piece of bread rather than paying for it.   Your crowdfunding argument is bogus because the amount of capital needed for certain projects, such as big budget movies, are not possible to consistently crowd fund. There have been less than 50 projects total which have crowdfunded more than $10 million dollars, source. Plus, it seems likely a single large bust would cause confidence to drop and then you\u2019ll have a large spiral of projects not being made and people not having any confidence because projects are being made. There is also an insane amount of risk involved, let\u2019s say you want to make a movie which costs 25,000,000 to make, what do you do while you\u2019re waiting for that crowdfunded money to come in? It doesn\u2019t happen overnight. When do you start making your movie? Do you start as soon as you have enough money to start production? It\u2019s risky because if you run out of money later, you\u2019ll have to stop and wait for more. Do you wait until you have enough money to make the entire thing? Can your crew wait that long? What happens if you go over budget? Your solution that creation can be consistently crowd funded is just too risky and naive.   Plus, even our current form of crowdfunding is really just designed to get concepts off the ground so they can eventually become self sufficient, which isn\u2019t possible without the project making money."}

{"prompt": "I believe that smoking is a privilege, not a right. CMV I hear often in response to smoking bans that people have a \"right to smoke.\" I feel that smoking is not a right that people have, but rather a privilege that can be taken away. Nowhere in any law does it say that people have the right to smoke, so people getting up in arms about \"smoker's rights\" are essentially, well, blowing smoke.  If a business, organization, or government wants to ban smoking in any area, they definitely have the right to do it, and no one should complain about their right to smoke being infringed upon by anyone, because the right to smoke is not something that exists.", "completion": "Nowhere is there a law that says you have the right to roll over in bed, so if your landlord wants to restrict your ability to roll over in bed should he be allowed to?"}
{"prompt": "CMV: Toilet paper is disgusting! In \"Western cultures\" it's normal practice to use wadded or folded tissue paper ONLY to clean ones rectum and affected areas after defecating, pull your pants up and go about your day.   There are few other cases where cleaning without the use of water and or soap is acceptable. Also no substance comes to mind as being more synonymous with grossness as human poop.    This begs the question how far can faeces be from the anus and still be acceptably dealt with using paper alone?! E.g. if it's on your hand, you'd use lots of soap. Foot? Knee? Thigh? Butt cheek?    Other cultures use water in the poop process from a tabo to the high-tech Japanese pleasure machines. How can I go to a village without running water and have water specifically for poop cleaning, but not have it in places we spray water in our lawns for fun. We obviously care more about our lawns not being brown.   I acknowledge the existence of bidets but really their adoption is very limited.    It baffles me how we have sanitiser in public toilets to clean the seat but not YOUR seat. Flushable wipes came and kind of went once the environmental impact was known. But where's the butt foam you can put on some TP and freshen up?!    I just don't think TP alone has ever cut it, and with the anus featuring more frequently in nocturnal activities a wash as you go process might help a lot of people.", "completion": "I use to use toilet paper only, but now I use toilet paper just to get the majority of the solids out and then I'd clean up with soap and water.

{"prompt": "Is a career in academia in Western Europe financially more rewarding and more balanced with respect to personal life than in the US? Pre-question: I didn't know which flair to choose from the available ones; if there's an issue, could a mod change it?  I get this impression from browsing this sub. A recurring theme is of the underpaid and overworked academic, but it doesn't seem to be as prevalent in Europe; apparently it mostly pertains to academics in the US. Is this mostly true?", "completion": "Generally, the work/life balance in Europe is a bit better, but the overall workload for more senior academic positions that I have first hand experience in was about the same.   Working hours of 50h per week or so is the norm for most European professors in my field, for example, and the pressure to publish is about the same as in the US as well.  Salaries in Europe are typically less than they are at ivy league universities in the US, and more comparable to state schools, but the overall quality of life of senior academics is the same in Western Europe and in the US. In other words, looking at my friends in the US, their take home salary is quite a bit higher than mine, but then, their cost of living is much higher, especially when considering the cost of health insurance, tuition for kids, mortgage costs, and the much worse pension system in the US. This is often overlooked. Just as an example, let's look at my situation in Germany. My private health insurance costs 270 EUR per month (including dental, no deductibles). Since tuition is free in Germany, putting a kid through university will only cost you their accommodation and food, so this costs at most 700 EUR per month, or about 40k/child for a total of 5 years of university education (up the MSc). Since I am a civil servant, my German professorship comes with a 71% final salary pension (which will be inflation adjusted) for which I do not have to pay anything - if I had to save for this, I'd have to save about 25% of my salary for 30 years or so. When folding this in, the salary differential between the US and Germany isn't that high anymore (but, yes, I'm aware that German professorships are at the high end for European academic salaries)."}
{"prompt": "[MCU] If Antman shrunk to the size of an atom, would he be strong enough to split an atom? Also, is that how that works?", "completion": "Short answer. No.  Long answer, he'd need Hulk level strength. Nuclear fission happens when alpha radiation strikes an atom's nucleus.  Alpha radiation is pretty energetic. In order to strike the nucleus it either needs to be very dense matter or very carefully aimed. The nucleus is positively charged, like the alpha radiation so it has to overcome the natural repulsion of same charge particles and then it has to overcome the strong nuclear force. This is easier of the particle is already an unstable isotope like uranium.  Antmans strength doesn't change only.his mass and momentum and density. But once he hits an atomic scale altering his density requires altering quarks, which are govermed.by quantum state rules, where Pym particles.cant go. At an atomic level he can pretty much only alter his momentum. Any smaller and he becomes a quantum particle, existing below the Planck threshold.  Any denser and the entangled Pym particles get lost in the quantum states of his body.  At an atomic scale density becomes a quantum question, classical models cannot describe it. So he could go very fast but only be as durable and heavy as a normal human body."}

I did a couple of years in a faculty role but decided to leave when I had my first child, after seeing so many female colleagues try to be a mom and a full time faculty member- almost all of them felt like they couldn't be successful in either role and it took a heavy emotional toll on them. Even before I became a mom I was stressed out and unhappy, so I decided to take a step back from academia and have a better work/life balance.  I've worked in a variety of other roles (medical education, senior project management, senior research scientist, etc.) and have been much happier. I've still been able to publish even in these other roles, which has been fun, and I've leveraged my teaching skills into leading workshops and doing corporate presentations.

{"prompt": "CMV: It is all but certain that Donald Trump will win the Republican nomination. I searched for this and was surprised not to see it.  I say \"all but certain\" because in the highly unlikely event of his death or conviction for a felony, I don't believe he would win the nomination. In pretty much any other scenario, he will.  The most recent CNN-ORC poll put Trump at 39%, a full 21% ahead of second place. He has held first place almost continuously (barring a brief peak by Ben Carson) since mid-July.  People often say that the Republican party is split into a minority (albeit a large one) who favour Trump and a majority who are waiting for another candidate to rally behind. But at this point it's far too late for a new candidate to enter the race, and even if he did, 40% of the Republican electorate is already gone.  More importantly, looking at this survey shows that Trump beats **every single other candidate** by a significant margin in a head to head. He beats Rubio (the establishment favourite) 57 to 43 and Ted Cruz (the compromise candidate) by the same margin.  He has ridiculed women, the disabled, Mexicans and Muslims, going so far as to suggest banning the latter from entering the country. Every time, his support goes up. There is clearly nothing he can say to lose that support.  And yet, the betting markets still have Marco Rubio way out in first, and Donald Trump only in third (albeit narrowly behind Cruz), so clearly there's still some reason people think he's going to falter.

Everything else being mentioned, like the fact that Trump can't get any higher, his competitors are splitting the vote which causes multiple effects that include Trump getting more screen time AND Trump getting inflated numbers due to that screen time, and the lack of Trumps mainstream appeal (and overall capability of winning the presidency) all come secondary to the fact that THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, THE PEOPLE WHO DECIDE WHO GET'S THE NOMINATION, really REALLY ^really hate the man"}
{"prompt": "My 13 year old daughter is pregnant and I need to know my legal options I live in Iowa. This morning my 13 year old daughter told me she was pregnant. My life has been just a blurry whirlwind ever since. I\u2019ve already contacted the police (the father is 16) and they\u2019ve declined to arrest him or charge him with anything as in our state there is a close in age clause that my daughter is just a 3 months short of falling under and they\u2019ve assed there was \u201cno real crime\u201d. Which is a whole other thing I plan on pressing with higher authorities.   What I need to know now is what are *my* options? My daughter absolutely refuses to get an abortion and won\u2019t even discuss adoption. She\u2019s made it clear she fully intends to birth this child and I have no f-ing clue what to do. I myself don\u2019t believe in abortions and I\u2019ve passed my values along to my daughter as well, but I definitely believe that adoption is the only good option in this situation. My marriage will not survive something like this and we absolutely can not afford to take care of another baby. I just can\u2019t. If I could, this would be another story but I can\u2019t make money appear out of thin air. We\u2019re barely making our mortgage and car payment as it is and we\u2019re living paycheck to paycheck. My husband was in an accident at the begging of the year and our savings have been entirely drained. I just can\u2019t imagine my daughter can just force us into poverty and gift us a child against our wishes.   Is there any way shape or form that my husband and I could compel her to give her baby up for adoption? I know it might sound heartless but can I make her live elsewhere? I just can\u2019t do this. My husband and I work full time and there\u2019s no way either of us could babysit for her. I just don\u2019t see how I\u2019m expected to foot the bill and raise this child and destroy my marriage and livelihood in the process. I know my daughter is 13 and they are selfish by nature sometimes,  but I just can\u2019t believe my daughter would force this on us despite all of my pleas. If I call CPS, what kind of intervention could they provide? I love my daughter very much but I\u2019m at the end of my rope and would even support her through an abortion, or adoption, or whatever, but we cannot and will not raise a baby we had no say in creating. Are there ANY legal options we have?", "completion": "You cannot force an adoption.   At your child's age you are still responsible for her needs.  She has resources available, such as WIC, and food stamps and such.   What you need to do is educate her.  Reach out to an adoption agency and at least talk her into an appointment to explore options.  Open adoption and such.  At her age she cannot consent to sex and she views the act as a sign of love from her boyfriend.   She believes the child is an anchor which will bond her and her boyfriend.  Please convince her otherwise; get her into therapy so she can work through the emotional roller coaster she is about to embark on.  Once she sees her BF retreating and pulling away (which most 16 year old boys will do) she may change her mind.  Consider borrowing a friend's baby and have her watch him for a few hours and hammer into her the full time responsibilities.  Good luck"}

{"prompt": "CMV: The idea that the unvaccinated are \u2018taking up beds\u2019, or undeserving of care is wrong and a profound perversion of liberal values, progressivism, and the antithesis of the compassionate goals of modern healthcare So upfront, I\u2019m an ICU nurse, about ten years into the career.  I\u2019ve worked only in the United States, but have worked in 5 or 6 different states, East to West coast, and the brunt of that has been in Western moderately to overwhelmingly \u2018progressive\u2019 large cities.    Things to get out of the way: I\u2019m vaccinated, I believe the vaccine is scientifically an incredible achievement, safe, and generally everyone who can get it should get it, certainly anyone with any dangerous comorbidities like HTN, obesity, or DM.  This isn\u2019t a discussion about vaccine efficacy.  During the pandemic, specifically the delta waves in late 2020-early 2021, the ICU units I was working on were alternating between waves of dying COVID patients, almost entirely unvaccinated, and being filled with severe end stage alcohol abuse and IV drug use patients. At one point, in a weeks time we went from entirely full of COVID patients, to 100% full of alcohol abuse and withdrawal, suicide attempts, IVDU, and end stage lung disease from smoking, generally in addition to obesity, uncontrolled diabetes, etc.  These other conditions are not new, ICU\u2019s have been this way for decades.  My coworkers were appalled, and the opinion was often that the unvaccinated were taking up ventilators and beds.  I couldn\u2019t help but think; *what kind of supposedly liberal worldview would look down upon the group of people being literally slaughtered by an unprecedented airborne pandemic virus as unworthy of treatment and compassion?*. This concept has bothered me for over a year now, which is why I\u2019m here.  The premise of my position: *healthcare resources since the inception of modern healthcare have been overwhelmingly skewed towards use by people of lower socioeconomic status and poor health illiteracy, and COVID is no different.*  This isn\u2019t rocket science, people with less resources are chronically stressed, make worse health choices, and suffer from more chronic diseases than health literate, well off people.  They spend far more time sick in ICU\u2019s than healthy people.  Robert Sapolsky did a lot of great work on the subject, and \u201cWhy Zebras Don\u2019t Get Ulcers\u201d is an excellent read on the subject.  Not being vaccinated is correlated with being conservative politically, but far more concretely correlated with being uneducated or being poor or marginalized.  *It is still to my knowledge profoundly illiberal to mistreat and look down upon uneducated, poor people in general.  In the setting of a global pandemic and an era of high government mistrust for these communities, acceptance of this view is absolutely embarrassing.*  Common argument I\u2019ve heard and am entertaining; *the unvaccinated simply made one unacceptable behavioral/moral choice, the loads of other chronically ill morbidly obese, long term smokers, and general abusers of their health have biological predispositions for using healthcare resources;IE not their fault.*  Well, yes and no.  Behavioral science is a fascinating and evolving discipline that I\u2019m not well versed in, but vaccine hesitancy seems to me to be an extremely arbitrary point to draw the line between victim and villain.  When a patient is hospitalized for a suicide attempt, we\u2019re saddened that they stopped going to therapy or taking their antidepressants, but we don\u2019t believe they\u2019re taking up a hospital bed, or berating them for this poor choice.  When a patient decides to stop taking their prescribed diuretics, or skip dialysis and ends up on life support, knowing full well of the consequences (this happens *astonishingly* often), we don\u2019t look down on them for it.  We treat them.  This argument is rooted in the idea that some types of people have diagnosed diseases and are incapable of being at fault or making decisions for themselves, but the unvaccinated are not privy to that status.  *This sort of implies to me that we believe smoking addiction or food addiction has biological/social causes and being unvaccinated does not, or that those causes are less justified.* My understanding of behavioral science and human nature is that these processes are more complex and assigning agency or lack thereof in a black and and white manner doesn\u2019t seem beneficial.", "completion": "I've worked in health care too and I think you're dramatically overestimating the kindness and understanding shown to people with mental illness, obesity, and addiction.

I admit I am stupid in many many things but I do not follow through on my stupidity by making wild assertions on topics I have done zero work on (this topic aside, but looking to be proven wrong).  The worst part is, because most people on Reddit are this way, I often see the exact wrong assertions with the most upvotes in topics that I am well researched in (because it is part of my job, and my educational background).

Other people can be confident irrespective of their knowledge, the stupid people you describe. Some people who don't know either way perform the low friction upvote on an idea they like the sound of. They wouldn't have commented, but it sounds plausible, and it's just an upvote - so why not. You don't know how thoughtful this person is really. This starts to rank it higher, so more people see it. The more people see it, the more upvotes - that is the hive mind effect.  All this means is that if the population was 50/50 thoughtful Vs unthinking, unthinking comments would be more prominent. The strength of the effect could mean that there are more thoughtful people on Reddit than unthinking people, but you wouldn't be able to identify it."}

{"prompt": "Why did my deep fried turkey turn black? Like real black: http://i.imgur.com/xL2F7K6.jpg.  I witnessed what started off as a fine bird being fried today. The bird was prepared with the rub from this recipe: http://www.chow.com/recipes/10729-fried-turkey-with-southern-rub  The man in charge of fryer had the oil up at 400, slowly lowered in the bird, the temp dropped, and recovered relatively quickly to around 350 where it was maintained. But within 10-15 minutes of getting the bird submerged, the legs were looking quite well done. When we pulled it up, it was black. We kept cooking it in hopes that the meat would still be delicious. Sadly, it ended up being a total loss, as it was real dry inside (my suspicion was that the dryness was due to an unrelated error --cooking the bird for too long-- 55 minutes for a 14 lb. bird --without much regard for the internal temp).  The general consensus around the fryer was that the blackness was caused by the sugar in the rub. However, a quick scan of internet deep fried turkey recipes seems to suggest that a great many people put sugar on their deep fried turkeys without having this issue, leaving me unconvinced.", "completion": "Similar thing happened to me the first turkey i fried.  Here is what i learned: never, ever, ever use sugar when you brine a turkey that you plan on frying.  The sugar does not caramelize.  It burns at 350.  Also dont use a rub on a fried turkey.  the rub will burn.  The only way to get flavor in to a bird that you are gonna fry is to either brine it, or inject it or both.  We fry 3-4 turkeys every year and have not had the problem since we stopped adding sugar to our brine.  Also, 3 minutes a pound, 11 pounds or less."}

He even lended me his candy thermometer, but he didn't remember the right temperature (and internet didn't help because it was a very old one with an odd scale).  I tried to make some, had to start over 3 times, but finally managed to succeed by letting a drop of boiling syrup fall down into ice cold water to see if it was ready.

My therapist suggested getting tested and to my complete surprise I checked all the boxes. My attention was at the 8th percentile \ud83d\ude2c. Getting the diagnosis was extremely helpful because I finally stopped blaming myself. I educated myself and read literally 20 books and listened to podcasts to understand what I can do to combat it. All of that skill building helped in addition to medication. Within 6 months I made a ton of changes and was able to get my manuscript and thesis published finally. Dealing with ADHD is still a work in progress, but getting the diagnosis was life-changing for me.  Edit - This won't be relevant for everyone but a lot of the negative effects of ADHD were related to a lack of emotional regulation for me. There is a strong correlation between CPTSD and ADHD and solving ADHD alone did not infact rid me of the massive issues that come with CPTSD.

{"prompt": "cmv: LA is an absolute shithole of a city, both to live in and to visit LA doesn\u2019t really even feel like a unified city - more like a jumbled clusterfuck of corporatized, commercialized Americana. It has no core, unless you consider its brutally ugly downtown a core. DTLA literally has no attractive qualities for a visitor or a resident. Its basically composed of soulless corporate and residential towers that are obscenely large, as well as rundown areas filled with the homeless on every corner. It just feels depressing, like something went terribly wrong somewhere down the line. It fails to serve its purpose as the focal point of a massive city, leaving its visitors and residents alike running around like headless chickens in search of some kind of belonging. All the belonging they\u2019ll find is on the comically overburdened freeway system...  Other parts of LA are equally or, if not, almost as indicative of a culture in decline that is America. It\u2019s just a straight-up boring city. It\u2019s one of those American cities where what are considered its \u201cnice\u201d parts bare literally nothing of cultural value other than some half-decent restaurants and a shopping mall filled with boomers who \u201cwanna buy a pair of sneakers with lights in them,\u201d to quote George Carlin.  Chinatown is extremely underwhelming. Compared to the chinatowns of SF, Vancouver and even Victoria, it is absolutely soulless and unreflective of LA\u2019s vast Chinese community. Japantown is similar.   Venice Beach has become resemblant of a rundown 3rd world country in parts. Rodeo Drive is nothing but rich Arab pricks walking around as if they have class. It kind of makes me want to throw up. Hollywood Boulevard is a depressing shell of what it used to be. The Persian community here basically all have had inches of plastic surgery, even the men. It is a town of fake, plastic people trying to display their status in some superficial manner.  Maybe most disappointing to me, personally - LA is probably my favorite city from the history of punk rock. Its atmosphere in the 70s and 80s was gritty, vibrant and revolutionary, or at least that\u2019s what they tell me. But even that\u2019s dead today. Melrose Avenue, which is supposed to be the city\u2019s punk rock heart today bares nothing but a couple interesting record stores. Other than that it is resemblant of any other boring American street, with its own collection of fast-food restaurants and parking lots.  I do admit areas Iike Newport Beach and the Hollywood Hills would be pretty nice to live in. They\u2019re pretty luxurious, but the wealth divide between these areas and places like South Central, East LA and countless other places in between is starkly obvious when you\u2019re here. I\u2019m not saying this isn\u2019t present in other parts of the world, or even in other American cities - it just feels much more apparent when you\u2019re here than other American cities. Maybe this is because of the chaotic organization of the city - there\u2019s a feeling here where if you go like two blocks away from the expensive stores you start to hit dead industrial areas and lower class \u2018burbs that make you want to run away. I know New York feels nothing like this, even though there might actually be an even bigger wealth gap there.  If I\u2019m wrong about LA, let me know. If it\u2019s a fantastic city with a cultural identity and amazing tourist opportunities other than going to Disneyland, sitting in traffic, or going to a mall, change my view!", "completion": "I see your point but I\u2019d like to share some of my counter arguments:  First of all, LA has maybe the most authentic food of any culture outside of that country. You do have to know where to go in order to find them.  Chinese food - go to Monterey Park/ San Gabriel Valley and you can find every branch of Chinese food (Sichuan style, HongKong style, Beijing style, etc.) I.e you\u2019ve heard of boba tea but have you had Hong Kong style milk tea?   Japanese food - go to Torrance. There are traditional Japanese restaurant that serve food outside of ramen or sushi. Try visit the grocery stores or home goods store.   Korean town has the best Korean BBQ that opens late. Imagine having great meaty dinner with some friends, walk to a Karaoke place then hit up a korean ice cream joint after.   Other cuisines too and they are so easy to find. Anything you can think of, you can find the most authentic flavor easily in LA. I\u2019ve lost count how many times a native from another country tell me what they had in LA is equal or better than their hometown can offer.   Besides the food, I\u2019d say the best thing about LA is the weather. You can party almost everyday of the year. It hardly ever rains and the temperature is always warm enough for a night out. The night life is great. The clubs/pubs/bars are always packed with crowds and good music.  If you live in LA, eventually you will get to see the celebrities or whatever you dream of. I saw a Van Gough at the Getty museum. Met my favorite sports star. I even bumped into a movie star I loved for years at the back stage of a show. You can\u2019t ever have those experience anywhere else. Whatever you are into, they will make their way to LA. Bands, theater shows, sports teams, unique trade shows, etc.   Also, the beaches are so different from one or another. If you drive 5 mins south of Santa Monica at night, the beach has nobody and you can get a relaxing walk. Zuma beach has the softest sand I\u2019ve ever felt. If you just look outside from those few popular beaches, you are literally in a different world.   As far as culture go, I agree that LA has no real strong \u201cLA culture\u201d if you compare it to NY or Philly or Chicago. BUT, if you are a person of minority, you can always find a strong community of your own culture. I.e. a person of a foreign culture can find everything they need like restaurants, temples/churches, schools, services, jobs in their language. They can survive easily without knowing a word of English. Or if you are someone who lives  a non-main-stream life style, they can find local community/support as well.    So don\u2019t give up on LA. The traffic sucks major balls, as well as many other things. But it is able to offer things no other places can.  P.S. Here are some tips that may help you navigate LA as a tourist in pandemic: 1. Yelp is your best friend when it comes around food. Look up restaurants with the most review. There is a list for every type of food you are into. \u201cBest___ in LA\u201d. A few of my must try places: Porto\u2019s for pastries, Baycity Deli for Italian sandwiches, Sugarfish for sushi, Monterey park has several amazing Dim Sum restaurants.  2. Join a movie studio tour in Burbank.  3. Hike. Consider joining a meetup group from MeetUp.com.  4. Visit some famous movie/TV show filming locations around town.  5. Rose bowl flea market in Pasadena.   Whatever you decide to do, plan ahead according to traffic or you\u2019d spend half a day driving."}

As a result, housing is in more demand than ever. Homelessness is at an all time high in America which is sad for being one of the richest countries to live in. Part of the reason why homes are so unaffordable has been because of investors partaking in bidding wars with each other for limited supply. This inflates the price higher than if it was a market of only individuals actually looking to live in the homes that they are purchasing. Because of high home prices, this actually increases rent around the surrounding area which increases the cost of living and will result in less money for non-home owners overall. If this goes on longer, most people will be priced out of housing forever and the ruling class will be people who either bought land 20-30 years ago when it was cheaper or corporations that own all the housing to rent.  Suggested solutions: Make it more attractive to invest money in the stock market by reducing capital gains tax, Increase property taxes for individuals/corporations owning a second property that is not a primary residence. Properties outside of a primary residence can only be purchased in full cash, no mortgage. Prohibit corporations from purchasing residential real state, They may only invest in apartment communities or office buildings.", "completion": ">Suggested solutions: Make it more attractive to invest money in the stock market by reducing capital gains tax,  Sure - but realize, these are different investments with different risk profiles and payment structures.   > Increase property taxes for individuals/corporations owning a second property that is not a primary residence.   This is already the case. It also does not really impact people the way you think. Those with a 2nd house don't normally care. (unless it is a lake house/shack). Landlords already just pass this cost on to renters.   >Properties outside of a primary residence can only be purchased in full cash, no mortgage.   This is functionally impossible. The loan is a separate financial  instrument than owning a home. The loan is secured using the home but it does not have to be.   > Prohibit corporations from purchasing residential real state, They may only invest in apartment communities or office buildings.  This is another functional impossibility. I was a small business owner, had an LLC. Could have set it up a corporation. This was all done for liability protections. Did I mention I never had any employees.   You see the word corporation and think 'big company' and there is no reason to make that assumption. Just about any lawyer will tell you that if you run a business, like a landlord, you need to incorporate (C-corp, S-Corp, LLC) to protect your personal assets.    If I was a landlord, I would simply have a sole proprietorship parent (or partnership) who owned the physical properties and leased them to my LLC/Corporation who in turned leased them as rentals. A little more tax paperwork but it would be clear, the 'Corporations' didn't own the property.  Instead of trying to limit ownership, why do you instead solve the root cause and that is housing supply? What you propose is not going to impact housing supply at all."}
{"prompt": "I'm thinking of giving my younger sister a cat for her birthday. What do you say? A little background. I've a younger sister and she is 9 years old. A few months ago, she said she would like thai cat for her birthday. I knew she wanted a pet, but I didn't expect her to want this particular breed of cat. But she loves anime and everything related to it, and I guess that's why she wanted something of a similar theme. Apparently she's ardent fan.  &#x200B;  Let's get back to the point. It's not a problem for me to find this breed of cat and give it away. But yesterday I searched Google for at least some information about this breed and found something that made me doubt whether it was worth giving this particular breed.I found out that they have increased mortality and morbidity compared to other cat breeds. I just don't want it to somehow traumatize my younger sister if suddenly her cat dies from some disease. It will be a big blow for the child. I'm at a dead end right now.  &#x200B;  I need your help or at least some advice. Perhaps someone has or had this breed of cats. Tell me do they really have problems with morbidity? I read about thai cat that they have a huge number of diseases that they suffer from during their lifetime. I don't know if I should trust what I found, but it seemed very true to me. I'm sorry if I can't post information from other portals here, but my sister's birthday is very soon and I really need to know if I can still give this breed. I ask you not to comment that I am too trusting, that I believe any information on the Internet. I have not dealt with cat breeds and therefore the Internet is the only thing that has given me at least some information so far. But I also want to know about some personal experience with this breed and that's why I turned to you. What do you say?", "completion": "Having a 9 year old daughter I can 100% confirm that they are entirely unqualified to be the sole caretaker for another living creature.   Don't do it.

{"prompt": "CMV: The average US American is uneducated, uninformed, ignorant, and ignorant of their ignorance. First off, I don't blame them, it seems that their situation is deliberately externally imposed upon them. But the objective reality is that the average American person lacks a basic critical understanding of history, politics, geography, physical and natural sciences, philosophy, and language.  I was visiting my mom's house (long trip from her basement, because that's where all we redditors live) where she has French TV channels. On the regular TV channel during prime-time hours, they were having an in depth discussion with a prominent contemporary French philosopher. The dialogue was far reaching and analytical, and the audience was rapt. They brought on other public intellectuals and engaged in a debate. It wasn't entertaining in the American sense of sensationalism, yelling, and wild attacks that we are used to during such discussions on TV, and the language being used was decently sophisticated. It was eye-opening to see how this was on prime-time regular TV.  Next I watched the newscast and was floored to see comprehensive reporting and foreign correspondents covering a wide range of current events.   During the intermission, they had a brief section on the etymology of a French word. I doubt most Americans even know what etymology is!      Finally I saw some interviews with French politicians and the media, and holy crap, American politicians would melt under that pressure and scrutiny. They didn't let them weasel out of anything with hard-hitting follow-up questions. I could only imagine how the White House press conferences would unfold with such questioning.  Overall, I saw that French TV was for an audience of adults, while American TV is for an audience at the intellectual level of tweens.  I don't mean for this to sound like pretentious BS, because it was honestly startling and alarming how dumbed down we've become in this country. We should be at their level, but we're not.  &#x200B;  Obviously, it is a big stretch to go from watching an evening of foreign TV and making large assumptions about the general population, but it was telling. Americans are poorly educated, and are either proud or ignorant of the fact that they are so far behind the rest of the world.", "completion": "This sounds very /r/iamverysmart. Like \"they said etymology and I bet most of you guys have never heard of that word!\"  There are dumb Americans, dumb French people, dumb German people etc etc. Americans might just do a bit better job at putting it out there for the world to see sometimes."}
{"prompt": "CMV: TV Series are a better medium for most existing books and similar IPs rather than movies When making an adaption of a book a limited series or recurring series for multiple books.   Most people agree that movie adaptations of books are usually sub par.  There are some exceptions.  When adapting a book you either need to leave out interesting B plots, or move the story faster and give up some character development.  You often lose nuance and the tenor and tone, and in worst cases have plot holes that make no sense.  Harry Potter for the most part did a good job.  The main story was told well, made sense and hit on the main points. But some B plots were left out, deeper details like more of Voldemorts family history were left out.  This is rare.   Let's look at Stephen King.  Many of his books have sucked as movies.  Why?  He has generally long books with lots of background of his characters that is important for the story.  The ones most well done like Shawshank Redemption and Stand By Me (The Body) were novellas so not much needed to be left out.  And mini series did well the original The Stand was good, so was It, The Outsider and even Mr Mercedes (although few saw it).  These are single books told over 8+ hours. Much easier to tell the whole story.  This past fall I watched Queens Gambit, it felt like a movie, the way it was filmed the pacing ect.  It told the whole story, it wouldn't be nearly as good in 2 hours.  Same with Big Little Lies (1st season).  Very movie like, nuance and being a mystery no major plot holes for time.   Now does this mean there shouldn't be movies?  No, comedies and action movies even dramas that can be told in 90-150 minutes would be great. Original dramas or short stories..   And with movies like Wonder Woman and Soul and Mulan being released on streaming services we see that money can be made from our sofas.   Is this going to solve the problem of bad book adaptions? No, but I think it would do many more books the justice they deserve.", "completion": "I think OP is misunderstanding the cinematic adaptation process. A good adaptation captures the tone, feeling, and overall elements of a novel\u2019s story. A good adaptation does not **specifically** have to follow the novel\u2019s plot beat for beat. This is something a lot of people criticize adapted films for, that they\u2019re *different* from the source text. I think that\u2019s a pretty sophomoric way of looking at adaptated works. I\u2019ll cite some examples.  Alfonso Cuaron (who also directed arguably the best Harry Potter film, a film series OP mentions-I won\u2019t get into the idea of a \u201cseries of movies\u201d)\u2019s *Children of Men* is a really good, interesting, well made adventure-thriller-whatever you wanna call it based on the novel by P.D. James. In James\u2019 novel, much like in the film, women are unable to conceive children, and the human race is slowly dying out and becoming geriatric. The novel follows an English professor trying to protect his pregnant ex-wife and ultimately becoming head of government after a climactic confrontation between him and his aristocratic brother.  In Cuaron\u2019s film, however, the protagonist is vaguely similar to James\u2019 protagonist and women cannot conceive children, but his ex-wife, portrayed by Julianne Moore, is shot dead midway through and the child is actually carried by a young African girl. The rest of the film though is more about the violent dystopian apocalypse that comes when man cannot procreate, showing refugee camps that evoke holocaust imagery, factions of rebel groups, and lots of guns and intense action scenes shot in an incredibly cinematic way. Cuaron\u2019s film inarguably is more relevant and topical and does more with the core concept than James\u2019 novel because it reimagined the source material rather than directly adapting it.  Andrei Tarkovsky\u2019s *Stalker* too reimagines the Strugatsky Brothers\u2019 *Roadside Picnic* from science-fiction genre-gore into one of the most beautiful films about a couple guys in the woods. Only a small portion of the novel is used to adapt the film. One of the beautiful parts of the adaptation process is taking a small part of one text and turning that into an entire other text of its own in conversation with the source.  This process could alternatively called be **appropriation**, but in truth these two concepts are one and the same, perhaps opposing ends of the adaptive spectrum.  My point is that I believe OP\u2019s criteria for what makes an adaptation good are inherently flawed. What works in a novel simply does not work on film. You can have a novel like *\u00c0 Rebours*, about a rich guy who just wants to be left alone and sit in his special little room that he\u2019s painted a specific shade of yellow, that\u2019s very introspective and filled with omniscient character insights and hangs on its description of every detail. But you can\u2019t really do that in a film. Your audience can\u2019t read character\u2019s minds.  By saying \u201coh well books are too long to make into a film, they should be television series instead,\u201d you\u2019re dismissing the actual content of the book. Sure, maybe *Dune*\u2019s story is impossible to tell in one feature length film because it\u2019s so incredibly long and filled with so much plot. But I think most books are long because of the author\u2019s style. Just like a movie, the author paces his novel in a specific way for dramatic purposes. Each paragraph and page creates tension and drama, hopefully making you want to turn to the next page and keep reading to find out what happens, much like you\u2019re hooked watching *Twin Peaks: The Return*, hoping every episode for Coop to snap out of his Dougie state.  I guess what I\u2019m saying is that the actual essential *story* of any given novel could probably be reduced down to a few sentences highlighting key elements of the plot or whatever, or it could be stretched to fill three 1,000 page volumes. *The Hobbit* could\u2019ve been one really really good film. Instead, Peter Jackson wanted to make a lot of *money* and made it a series of three films. Did it being a series with room to breathe and flesh out Tolkien\u2019s story make it better? Personally, the first *Hobbit* movie was my first huge letdown in the movie theater, having grown up on the *Lord of the Rings* films, which I think work excellently as individual films in a way that would not have worked as a television series.  TL;DR\u2014adaptation is a lot more than being faithful to source material and to say that you need a lengthy television series to properly adapt a lengthy novel is na\u00efve.  A bit more on Stephen King:  I personally believe Stephen King\u2019s books are only so great in length because he sits in his office and does a bunch of cocaine to write as much as he can as fast as possible. That\u2019s also why he has so *many* books and why there\u2019s so much stuff that doesn\u2019t make any sense or feel like the delusions of a madman. (Ex: the sewer orgy and the space turtle that\u2019s actually god and pennywise in *It*).  King is also an egomaniac. When Kubrick diverged so greatly from the source text in *The Shining*, King was outraged. In one scene, Scatman Carothers drives past a car accident with a red Volkswagen: the car the Torrance family drives in the novel. Kubrick literally crashed King\u2019s story into a fucking tanker truck and made it his own. OP is like Stephen King, getting mad that his books aren\u2019t getting adapted faithfully line-for-line into multi-season television series like *Under the Dome*.  Along with reading up about the author a bit, my opinion on him is informed by an anecdote about Stephen King from a teacher I had in high school.  It\u2019s the early 2000\u2019s, maybe even the late 90\u2019s. Every high school English and theatre class in the city (there are 12 public high schools in my hometown, so maybe it was just one grade of English? That\u2019s a lot still) was crammed into the convention center to hear a talk by popular novelist Stephen King, where he was gonna give one of those \u201cwriting is great stay in school\u201d talks.  Well, once everybody settles in and he\u2019s introduced, Stephen King walks out onstage with a glass in his hand and a lit cigarette. He approaches the microphone and says \u201cI fucking hated school. I hate writing and only do it for the money.\u201d Then he sat down in a chair and sipped his scotch and smoked his cigarette.  Then all these teachers are scrambling trying to get busses to send all these kids home and organize this mass exodus from the convention center, all while Stephen King is up there thinking he\u2019s cool as fuck. Well Stephen, if you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019re not cool and I think your books suck."}

It is on the parents or guardians to prove they are teaching their children if an investigation is opened and they can get into trouble if they aren't actually teaching their kids.   Denying access to medical care based on not believing in medicine is ridiculous. I get some people not believing in NEW vaccines but to not believe in medicine at all is a little ridiculous considering the world we live in and the diseases we have to deal with, that medicine can help, cure or alleviate symptoms of.

My advice is to go into an Asian market with a recipe in hand and only buy what you need. Look for pictures and names of vegetables you are looking for on the internet and write them down to take with you to the store.  If you see a video recipe on Youtube and they are using a condiment, like fish sauce, try and memorize the label so you can look for it.

{"prompt": "Would it be ethical to observe uncontacted tribes via satellite, making the data available to anyone? When the technology becomes widespread enough to be affordable, would it be ethical to use it to spy on people unaware they're being spied on?", "completion": "This is really not a question about anthropology- it's a question about ethics in general, because you really won't get any actual anthropological knowledge by spying on people from afar.   It's tempting to equate the 'clandestine' aspect of such a setup with a sense of 'objectivity', as you might think the people you're watching are behaving 'naturally' (as they don't know they're being spied on). But whatever information you gather is quite useless unless you've embedded yourself in the contexts of the people you're observing, and gleaned something about their conceptual universe. It's only with this deep socio-cultural understanding that you can scientifically make sense of why people behave the way they do.   So this sort of clandestine observation wouldn't add anything to what we already know about humanity, because it's so methodologically incomplete as to not even qualify as a valid, scientific form of ethnography (i.e. 'data collection').  Taking this into account, the question really becomes an ethical one- is it ok to spy on people for whatever reason? The short answer for me is 'absolutely not', but for a deeper discussion on this and similar questions, you can perhaps check out scholars such as Michel Foucault or Judith Butler. (I'm not well versed in literature on ethics, but I'm sure others here can help you out).  Of course there's no clean line dividing ethics and anthropology (or for that matter any other scientific practice) as any ethical system is itself socially constructed- but for practical purposes, a good rule of thumb is: if it's unethical, don't make a methodology out of it.  I'd recommend having a look at Clifford Geertz's classic essay 'Thick Description: Toward an Interpretive Theory of Culture' in his book 'The Interpretation of Cultures' (PDF), specifically, his example of how a simple wink can have countless meanings, depending on countless cultural factors (Geertz actually gets this example from philosopher Gilbert Ryle).  Additionally, if you'd like to know more about similar (and more pertinent) ethical issues central to ethnographic research, the book 'Writing Culture' edited by James Clifford & George Marcus is a great place to start. The book was part of what some call the 'reflexive turn' in anthropology and to this day continues to make scholars think about the way they do research, their relationship with the subjects of their research, the extent to which anthropologists 'create' ethnographic knowledge, and so on."}

Glaciers grind tough mountains to a pulp, without any dead plants lol. Volcanos erupt into huge mountains of ash and pebbles which is great for plants.  Soil doesn't come from dead plants. There was soil before life: Basalt from volcanos gets compressed into metamorphic rock and seperates into crystls like Gneiss, feldpsar, quartz, and then the wind and rain and ice crack the mountains of gneins and feldspar and quartz and turn them into mountains of pure sand, regardless of life.  Volcano rock is also fine for plants to grow on... look at iceland, very little life to transform the rocks. Ancient stratovolcanos can actually make very little rock, most of the material lands as little rocks and ash which becomes clay and soft-rock which you can break up with your hand and that roots can get into. The only thing that creats super tough rocks is very high compression and some kinds of basalt flow from non-violent volcanos, most of the planet was created with the violence of a shaken cola bottle."}

However, the analogies are NOT the math. You cannot draw conclusions from them - they are meant only to simplify the theory for consumption by the rest of us.

{"prompt": "CMV: Piracy is not morally equivalent to stealing, and \"intellectual property\" is not morally equivalent to \"physical property\" If I go into a Walmart, and grab a loaf of bread, slip it under my hoodie and run out of the store with it, what are the consequences of my actions?  Well, Walmart doesn't have the bread anymore, and they thus can't sell it. So Walmart will lose a sale on bread at the very least. If stealing bread was too easy, Walmart might never sell bread, so the threat of stealing forces Walmart to pay for guards to protect their stuff and prevent stealing, and creates an environment where Walmart wants to vote in politicians who will create a police force that will discourage stealing.  But consider a hypothetical. What if I had a sci-fi gadget that let me duplicate matter down to the atom? I walk into Walmart, point it at a piece of bread and double it, walking out with the copy that I made.  Did I steal anything from Walmart?  Well, the original bread is still there. Walmart can still sell it. And while my piece of duplicate bread is causally dependent on a supply chain of farmers and shippers, the proximal cause of the bread existing is me creating a copy of it.  What's the difference here? Well, most things that we talk about \"stealing\" involve scarcity and exclusion.  Our society is very wealthy, but we don't produce infinite bread with zero human effort. We don't have a matter duplication machine, so we still have to grow all of our food and all of the people involved only get their money if people actually exchange bread for cash.  The only obvious thing is that our current economic model would be a comical mismatch for a world where matter duplicators were widely available.  For all practical purposes computer data works like the matter replicator in modern times. Once I have the bits representing a song, it is essentially effortless and costless to reproduce an exact copy, and a million copies isn't far behind that.  And yet, music producers insist on keeping an economic system designed for scarcity applied to a part of the economy where there is no actual scarcity. It's like if the government outlawed duplicating food, because it was stealing from farmers. As long as we could make mutually beneficial and consensual social arrangements where some people made food, and everyone got the food, we wouldn't need to outlaw duplicating food.  I think that we have the business model of media distribution backwards in society, in light of the fact that distribution approaches being costless for digital products.  Where does a consumer pay into the production cycle in the current system? At distribution - the \"easiest\" part of the process. Essentially, content producers get no new money until after a product is made and distributed, and so production companies need to pay for new projects with the profits of older products.  But what if we paid into the system in a different part of the production cycle?  We have already seen some success with alternative models like Kickstarter and Patreon.  Right now, we \"need\" big studios, because they have the money sloshing around to make projects happen, since all the artists need to be paid while they're making a product, and the studio won't start making money until it is complete.  But what if crowdfunding replaced all of that? Content creators could be paid ahead of time, wouldn't need big studios with lots of prior profit to make new projects, and would be fully paid for their works and thus not care about people distributing their works without permission.  I think that we live in a world comparable to the one where matter duplicators exist, but entrenched interests prevent them from being widely used. In such a world, I don't think it is morally wrong to duplicate food - as long as farmers are able to make a living, a few free riders don't matter, and it is the perverse incentives keeping a bad system in place that make the \"stealing\" a problem in the first place.  It is better to recognize when goods are scarce, and when they aren't and create an appropriate system for each of those kinds of goods in society.", "completion": "So replace Walmart with Local Bakery in order to humanize the workers (because I know you don't see any of the wage slaves at Walmart as real people).

How long is the Local Bakery going to stay in business if you and everyone else starts magically creating bread out of thin air?    \\-------------------------------------------------------------  In addition to this, as others have pointed out already - the stuff you're stealing (pirating) costs money because it took *time* to create it.  Think about going to a sporting event.  The only tangible thing your ticket is getting you is a seat to sit in.  Do you think you're paying $80 to rent that chair for a few hours?  Or are you paying the athletes?  The coaches?  The trainers?  The field crew?  The office staff?  The janitors who up after the game?    \\-------------------------------------------------------------  \"But what if crowdfunding replaced all of that?\"  You know it's called when lots of people buy a product: crowdfunding.

He was very smart, went to an exceptional undergrad, had several patents as an undergrad, and was accepted for his PhD with one of the best labs in the world, so he picked his research based on impact potential, which would legit have been immense - had he completed it.

{"prompt": "CMV: If the ABC Diversity Rap video is representative of Privilege theory, I believe it is then a greatly harmful belief So this video has gotten some notoriety lately, partly for being removed after some backlash for the concept of privilege being pushed on children. But rather than focusing on that aspect, I would like to focus on how they portray privilege theory and why if that is truly how people feel it is best to represent privilege theory that I feel it is an overall harmful method to get a message across.  To start, first I say \"if this represents\" because I know that people will come in here claiming that this doesn't represent what privilege theory is (just as often people will do the same for other Social Justice concepts), that of course they portray it wrong but it's still very helpful. If that is the case, I would like some sign that people have taken issue with its portrayal here from people who support Privilege theory rather than the words of the individuals who will comment on this topic. An article preferably. I say this as this video basically represents how Privilege theory has always been portrayed to me and seems accurate to how people apply it in other areas.  To give a summary of the video and their presentation of Privilege, they present privilege as the ability of crossing the \"river of dreams\" with two separate participants, Ross \"Straight, White, Wealthy, born in a peaceful nation\" and Stevie \"Refugee, does not speak English not well off, has a cough\". Ross is portrayed as being able to teleport across the river of dreams while Stevie has to swim. It says this is not fair and gives a more succinct definition of Privilege as being \"born with advantage, unfair gifts that his life was granted and might not think about his perks\".  Now with that pretext out of the way, I can finally explain my issue with the video itself.  My biggest issue is with how it first portrays the advantage of privilege. In this video we see privilege as granting Ross the ability to instantly cross the River of \"dreams\" due to teleportation, while Stevie has to swim. The person with privilege is portrayed as not having to really do anything to succeed in life (it's the river of dreams, so presumably Ross had his dreams come true) while Stevie both had to Cross the river by swimming, but also with a cough. If you are accurately going to be portraying what privilege is, you would instead have Ross swim across as well, and maybe say Stevie has a cough, or maybe is carrying some weights. It should be saying that it's still something both people need to put effort into but one person may have some disadvantages that hinder them. That both may fail or succeed despite their circumstances, that privilege isn't your life is great and awesome.    This in turn brings me into my next major issue, the portrayal of lacking disadvantages as privilege. While not really fully explored in the video as their one example of privilege is fantastical (I mean, they could have at least gave him a boat or something), but it does say advantage and unfair gifts. While indeed privilege does grant an advantage in the most literal sense of the term, most actual advantages of privilege I see listed tend to always be phrased as \"Privilege is not facing this disadvantage\" Ie. If a traffic cop pulls me over or if the IRS audits my tax return, I can be sure I haven't been singled out because of my race (that is one of the earliest papers on privilege theory I believe, and all the privileges are easily and more effectively able to be presented as disadvantages). This focus on privilege as lack of disadvantage seems incredibly misguided as I would presume (as well as prefer) the state of being described as privilege as a default rather than a state of one person being placed as advantageous over one another. I believe it is more accurate to say that discrimination is a disadvantage that some people face rather than saying not being discriminated is a benefit. One sets up a world where discrimination is seen as expected and the baseline that people are treated, while the other says discrimination is not good and that not being discriminated should be the baseline of how people are treated.  Now we have privilege being portrayed as an over exaggeration of what it's benefits are along with the fact that it is a benefit in the sense that one does not face disadvantage and little else. It seems unnecessary to use the term privilege to describe this phenomenon, especially when the term carries pretty strong connotations. I find when most people hear that someone is privilege, their reaction tends to be that it is unfair and tend to dislike the one perceived as privileged due to that unfairness. That seems extremely common (I mean the video doesn't really give a good impression of Ross does it?), and it seems odd to me that these benefits of not being discriminated are labeled as privileges that people have. This seems pretty harmful honestly as it places these things that should be the standard for how people are treated as things that are actually bad. This topic was partly inspired by the other CMV on the front page recently about the guy who feels like the bad guy partly due to all this rhetoric and they were several people in the comments that seemed to echo that sentiment. These are adults who agree with the message but began to feel horrible due to this rhetoric. And if I can be somewhat extreme for the moment, but a lot of propaganda used by the Nazis and Communists portrayed the Jewish people and the Bourgeois as people to be blamed for the problem of the people and had great advantages in society. I'm not saying that is what is being done here (instead I'd probably say this terminology is to take advantage of a lot of people's desires to be helpful and liked by painting their normal existence as negative the way that many people can feel a sense of white guilt), but I do have to point out such similar rhetoric was used to cement dislike and hatred of their victims. I don't feel we should be promoting such language and attitude in these discussions as they just seem to cement more and more dislike and guilt then understanding and unity.  As it currently stands, I just can't really see privilege theory as not being harmful as it seems to both make people feel bad of their place in life by misrepresenting what benefits privilege actual grant and uses terminology that paints those people in a negative light. This video meant to be shown and help to educate kids both emphasizes these issues by downplaying what Ross's life is actually like and not going into any depth on the difference of the collective view of privilege and taking it at an individual level, something that many adults seem to take issues with. I would like to hope that privilege theory is just a bunch of people not realizing the way they are portraying people is harmful, but there seems to be a reluctance to acknowledge the problems it may have. _____  > *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

Can you link us to an academic source that you have read that portrays and applies privilege theory the same way as this video?"}
{"prompt": "I've seen some bakers put syrup directly on cake when making layer cakes. What is the benefit of this? Wouldn't it make the cake overly sweet? As the title mentions. When making a layer cake, I've seen several bakers pour a bit of sugar syrup (or similar) on the cake itself before adding icing/filling when making a layered cake.  I'm assuming they're doing this to make their cake more moist and more sweet, which would make sense if your cake came out dry or whatever. But some people do this -all- the time. Wouldn't it just make more sense to use a different batter/recipe?", "completion": "Many sponge cakes, ones without butter or oil, are very dry and they need syrup if not they are too dry."}
{"prompt": "Roasted Chicken (6.48 lbs) in the oven for over 5.5 hours at 350 F. Cut into it: Still Raw. What went wrong? So I'm in an apartment that I've recently started renting for myself over the summer. As a poor college student, it isn't exactly the White House, but it has a stove, an oven, a sink, and a place to sleep so it serves my needs pretty well.  Or so I thought. Tonight I tried to make a roasted chicken dish that I've made once before here at this very same apartment in the very same oven. Before it was about a 7 lb chicken and it roasted for about 5 hours before the white popper came up indicating it had cooked enough. I basted it then about every 15 minutes in the chicken stock I put in the cooking pan. It also was stuffed with a ton of vegetables, so I wasn't too concerned with the above average cooking time.  Tonight however, I go to make the very same dish, the very same way in the very same oven. Yet, it took over 6 hours and still, the white popper had not popped up. I basted about every 15 minutes until about 4 hours in, at which time I basted about every 7 thinking that it was close to being done (wrong I was).  My ultimate question is this: what went wrong? My thoughts are that I either basted too frequently (causing all the heat to escape the oven?), or that the cuts I put in the breasts of the chicken and along the legs to check to see if it was cooked released all the heat and prevented it from cooking correctly. More fearfully however is that there is something wrong with the oven and it is not getting up to temperature. While I know it would be the landlord's responsibilty to get fixed, I'm really hoping this isn't the case, nor would I really know how to check if this is the case or not.  Any thoughts? Thank you in advance, I'm about to settle on some left over Chinese for dinner tonight I think...  tl;dr I roasted a chicken the same way I have before, yet took far too long for not even being cooked. Did I do something wrong, or is my oven on its way out?", "completion": "I agree with the majority of comments already posted. But, just wanted to add, \"A watched pot never boils\" for future reference. Opening an oven every 7 minutes for 2 hours is too much. AKA a pan shaker."}

Edit: for TN visa you get a job offer from the company saying So and So is coming to work at XYZ we will be paying them $$$. Please give them TN visa. You show up at border with degree and transcripts (showing you in fact are a professional under TN designation), job offer, some immigration paperwork (can be done yourself or through a lawyer). And then you get TN stamp/visa. I think my whole border crossing experience was 20 minutes or less.   I gave up my EIT/Peng route. For me it didn\u2019t add anything (salary or role), given it doesn\u2019t transfer to the USA (as far as I know). It also doesn\u2019t hurt to get it, just need to pay fees and take exams, so no real harm either way.

{"prompt": "CMV: Allowing androids (or robots that looks human) to live among us would cause more problems than they would solve I get how humanoid robots could help us automate the boring stuff, that's being done right now by non-humanoid robots and software scripts that are made of pythons.  But I can't see why anyone would think that an android that is indistinguishable from humans is a good idea.  Some pre-conditions and assumptions made about this post:  1. Androids does not necessarily possess fully autonomous AI, it could be a pre-programmed human-looking robot.  Although I'm not limiting the discussions to pre-programmed behavior, I am stating that sentient AI is not required for my arguments below. 2. Robots and by extension Androids while initially designed to obey some form of \"Three Laws of Robotics,\" can still be tweaked by hackers and the safety mechanism would inevitable be removed similar to how modern devices have jailbreaks to open up restricted functionalities. 3. The androids have crossed the uncanny valley and could pass for regular humans, if you're not an expert in looking for androids you'll probably think they're human.  Of the practical applications that Androids can fulfill the most subversive is that they could be developed for military applications, like Soldiers and Spy infiltration units.  While the benefit of easier \"training\" is possible the issues with software and ownership could be a problem.  Which furthers the point that developing androids would be problematic because machines run on software and could be turned against their directives just by hacking their software.   Another application is for the lonely or horny people could use them as companions or sex toys.  Which would incur the risk that those machines could either be spy androids which already exist in today's world as apps that collect our data and sell them to buyers.  As androids, these units would be expendable version of human spies and could potentially be produced in bulk.  From here all I can see is smart bombs disguised in human skin being deployed coyly in unsuspecting targets.  While dangerous machines always have fail-safe installed, nothing can be fully safe if a terrorist group or just some rogue employees would go out of their way to creating a back door.  Also let's imagine a scenario where androids was marketed to the world successfully and become ubiquitous some time in the future, what's to stop a hacker ring from creating some firmware that allows them root access and causing worldwide chaos to society?  Right now smart phones have vulnerabilities and our data can get scammed and our bank accounts can get drained but if androids that could potentially be stronger than humans could exist then that scene in iRobot is not only a possibility but there would be no centralized server that could \"turn off\" the rampaging androids from wiping humanity from the face of the earth.", "completion": "Back up. What makes you think we'd ever create robots indistinguishable from humans? That requires far too much effort on many levels. Sure, the fun experimental, solve this particular problem, type of robots are interesting, but when it comes right down to it, those are not particularly profitable. Don't forget, we pretty much only develop things if they provide a good return on investment and a machine nearly identical to a human is not profitable.   Humans are general purpose tools. When it comes to physical tasks, we can a lot of things but not do them as well as the machines we've built. The thing about the machines we build is that they're all specialized. The tree cutter can't dig a hole but, man, can it cut down trees WAY better than humans. So, we'll have very specialized machines to do all the things you need.   All machines are subject to problems, but we've been dealing with that for a couple centuries.   Artificial intelligence is the scary one (you can read up on that one). I doubt we'll be able to create a proper AI. Our brains are much too peculiar to create artificially."}
{"prompt": "What is Not Academic Freedom? One project I have is outcomes assessment for our department's basic course. Going through the other courses, I realized that most courses outside of the basic course have outcomes that are impossible to assess (e.g. \"Overcome gendered stereotypes\") and/or are totally unrelated to the course description.  I pointed this fact out to our lead faculty member, and she said that putting outcomes in a course would limit academic freedom. I'm pretty sure that's not what the phrase means, but it got a lot of nods in the room. I understood academic freedom, mostly, to be about the idea that research and scholarship should (in most circumstances) be allowed to exist without censure from the institution.  Am I missing another essential part of academic freedom, is my colleague off-base, or are we both wrong in our own way?", "completion": "A lot of faculty fail to understand what \"academic freedom\" actually means and how we (in the US) came to institutionalize it. Far too many of my colleagues seem to interpret it as \"I can do whatever I want in class and nobody can tell me otherwise.\" Others conflate it with tenure \"As long as I don't sexually assault anyone nobody can fire me for anything.\"  As a department chair I often have to explain this to other faculty. Academic freedom means nobody is going to fire you for pursuing scholarship or teaching that is unpopular for political reasons, but it still must be justified intellectually and within the context of your departmental or institutional curriculum.  If I'm hired to teach Shakespeare and instead develop a class about the feeding habits of deer, that's not protected by academic freedom at all; however, if my Shakespeare class empasizes gender roles and class-- and some rich right-winger on the board of trustees objects --academic freedom should protect me.  OP is correct. As a department chair I have a *reponsibility* to enforce departmental and course-specific learning goals. My colleagues have a responsibility to deliver courses that meet those goals. While it's fine for them to create additional goals-- including some that may not be assessible --they certainly are not \"free\" to disregard goals that our department or institution have linked to their courses."}

{"prompt": "CMV: \u201cGatekeeping\u201d nature\u2019s lesser known beautiful places a bit is okay. I\u2019ve had some of the best moments of my life in nature, and I wouldn\u2019t want to keep those experiences from anyone.   IMO as much as I love the amazing Grand Canyon of Yellowstone, the overlooks are usually pretty crowded and you only get a few seconds of a view of the waterfall before you feel like you need to let other people see.   \u201cDevils Bridge\u201d in Sedona is an amazing red rock formation with a stunning background.. but you have to wait in line for 30 mins to get your turn to go across, all while putting up with blasting music from four competing music speakers.   Angles landing? Super fun and thrilling hike that can make you feel alive\u2026 not super fun gripping the chains in a traffic jam with 1000 drop right underneath you as people are literally climbing over you to go the opposite direction.   I really do still enjoy these extraordinary places and there\u2019s a reason for the hype, and not much I can think of to stop it at this point.   However as amazing as these places are, I don\u2019t think there is anything that beats having a remote mountain lake practically to yourself, a slot canyon where you don\u2019t see anyone all day, a stretch of wilderness for miles with no signs of human in sight.   To find these places, you need to put some effort in usually. It involves research, finding out the right approach and season, and any other red tape with permits and such.   I\u2019m arguing that it should stay that way.   Something that has been increasingly getting on my nerves is people who have large followings posting about these lesser known spots, with exactly how to get there and specific instructions.   I\u2019m not talking about posting about the Grand Canyon or spots that are already pretty busy\u2026   but any spot or trail where it\u2019s likely you will only see maybe 10 people or less through the whole day.   Anything with more natural traffic than that\u2026 I don\u2019t really have an issue with.   I can think of one social media account in particular that was posting about a trail where you\u2019d maybe see 0-4 people on daily.   They have more than 100k followers. Obviously not all of them are just gonna flock over there\u2026 but if just 1% of those followers go check out the area, the normal usage amount for the year doubles instantly.    Here are my main concerns summarized.   1. These lesser known places are fragile and cannot handle the increased traffic that irresponsible social media posts can generate.  2. These places could be dangerous to those just going off a social media post without doing more research.  3. It doesn\u2019t actually take THAT much effort to do your own research and find these areas, and anyone who puts in the extra time should be rewarded with the solitude they seek.  4. Humans tend to ehm\u2026 ruin everything. The more people can easily find a place (where typically more research would be needed) the faster that place runs into the problems that all the other hot spots face.   Solution ?   Don\u2019t post geotags or specific location information to these lesser known spots.  Keep using the #keepthewestwild to spread awareness that it\u2019s a good practice.   It should be more socially accepted to roast these accounts that share too much.    Instead maybe give tips on HOW to find these places and leave it up to those willing to put in the effort.

{"prompt": "CMV: American football will never catch on outside the US As I see, American football has reached thirteen or fourteen countries. However, outside the US, there are very few or less league teams per country. Articles like this one can say what they wanna say about American football outside the US. However, I'm not optimistic about the sport's future.  I see very few or less successful leagues. As I found out, European League of Football was established two years ago. Very few agencies or organizations cover the League, whilst NFL still as always receives a lot of attention. Furthermore, each country has teams in several, few or less cities on average, which is a lot less than NFL.  The sport itself has more complicated rules and scoring, which can be intimidating for an average non-US local to learn about. I wonder whether they'll learn what \"1st & 10\" is, but I think they'll know \"Touchdown\" (scoring goal).  Furthermore, wearing gears and body protection requires a lot of money and resources, especially for an impoverished and poorly-skilled team. Without such protections, even the team would more likely get injured severely and would increase the risk of having its members killed.  Even building a football stadium requires more money and resources and consumes more land space than it should, especially for a poorer or smaller country.  In contrast, basketball has done extremely well outside the US. Even baseball has been popular in Japan.  Historically, the sport hasn't fared well outside the US. I wonder why American leagues are investing money on building a team outside the US. I also wonder why foreign leagues have been established recently. I can't help wonder whether global popularity of the American football was the reason, or the sport itself is unpopular outside the US.  American football players can receive nationwide fame all they want, but I wonder whether they'll earn global fame. I've not yet seen such player become famous around the world.  I wonder whether such player sought non-sport fields, like OJ Simpson did in *Naked Gun* trilogy.... before his infamous murder case. Being a sports announcer is one of sports fields to me, so that doesn't count as a \"non-sport field\". Coaching is a \"sports field\" as well.  I wonder which sport can overtake American football's popularity in the United States, if neither rugby nor soccer (association football) nor cricket nor baseball can stand the chance.", "completion": "Football is already popular in Canada, they've had their own league for over a century with slightly different rules. In Britian American football has a sizable minority fan base, similar to soccer in the US. NFL games there sell out months in advance. Football is also popular in Mexico, where NFL games have sold out and where the Dallas Cowboys are incredibly popular.   The NFL is a $16 billion+ league and in the US college football has to be a $10 billion business, maybe more. The game is growing overseas. It's already caught on overseas amongst a minority of fans in various countries. There is no reason to believe the sport won't grow. Particularly in Britain, Germany, Australia, Mexico and perhaps South America."}

{"prompt": "CMV: The anti-harassment slogan should have been \u201cBelieve accusers\u201d, or \u201cListen to accusers\u201d, or \u201cListen to victims\u201d, etc. Not \u201cBelieve women\u201d. The main reason is accuracy about what you mean. If a man makes an accusation of being sexually harassed at work (against a person of any gender), should we tend to believe him? If a person (of any gender) makes a harassment accusation against a woman, should we tend to believe the accuser? If your answer to these questions is Yes, then the slogan aligning with these beliefs is \u201cBelieve accusers\u201d, not \u201cBelieve women\u201d. The fact that accusers are disproportionately women, is irrelevant \u2013 why settle for a slogan that mostly aligns with your beliefs, if you can use one that aligns 100%?  In a previous CMV, someone argued that \u201cBelieve women\u201d was illogical because you should not automatically \u201cbelieve\u201d any person; the top-voted counter-argument was that there was a historical tendency not to believe accusers, so the \u201cBelieve women\u201d slogan was intended to counteract this. Fine \u2013 but then this should apply to other accusers as well, to the extent there\u2019s a tendency not to believe them.  (In particular, if a man accuses a woman of unwanted sexual advances, he is likely to get some ribbing from friends about how he couldn\u2019t have \u201creally\u201d minded all that much, especially if the woman is attractive.)  And, frankly, I think all of this is obvious enough that the slogan \u201cBelieve women\u201d has a whiff of male feminists sounding deliberately irrational in order to impress the women in their lives, when they should just say what they mean: Listen to accusers.

I will be teaching art history and film studies - both are humanity subjects which requires loads of texts  in their discussions and nothing much more, apart from clips and screenshots of films or photos of artworks and artists. For me personally, this has made it very hard for me to think about more engaging ways of doing my powerpoint.  Besides, I personally do not have much previous teaching experiences. Meanwhile, the way lecturers from my MA study teach these subjects cannot give much inspirations for me. They tend to just read from their slides, instead of using it as to assist and elaborate lecture contents... So I do not really have anyone to learn from.", "completion": "Slide 1: Tell em what you\u2019re gonna tell \u2018em.  Slides 2-19: Tell em.  Slide 20: Tell em what you told em.

You don\u2019t need more than 20 slides unless you\u2019re planning to lecture for more than two hours without break (don\u2019t do this).   Slides should have no more than six bullet points and no more than 35 characters per bullet point (the fewer the better). Talk about each bullet point for about a minute on average.  Light background, dark text. Serif fonts are easier to read. Don\u2019t get fancy. Your information, delivery, and anecdotes should be the presentation. The slideshow is just an aid.  Good luck!"}

Well of course my grandmother decided to do whatever she wanted with the tomatoes before delivering them and juiced them instead of just giving them to us.

Recently I made it in a food processor for the first time and found it was so much better as a result. I was just curious to hear, is this the most common method? Do most people use food processors for pie dough now? If you do it by hand why do you prefer it that way?

Larger pieces of butter (walnut-sized) will leave bigger pockets that when baked will result in a flakier crust.  Smaller pieces will make the crust more \u201cmealy\u201d.  It depends on how you like your crust and how much time you want to spend on it.  I prefer flaky crusts and do a little rough puff folding, but it takes more time so sometimes I opt for the food processor.  Sometimes it\u2019s too darn hot and I can\u2019t keep the butter cold so I use a pastry cutter or a food processor."}

{"prompt": "CMV: trans women should not be allowed to compete in women's sports, they should rather have a new category. To start off, since this can't go without saying: I have no problem with the concept of dysphoria, or trans people. And in my post, \"male\" and \"female\" mean phenotypically XY and XX, and have nothing to do with gender.  I firmly believe that trans women (who were born male) should not compete in, or be allowed to compete in, women's sports.   The male body is inherently bigger and stronger than the female body. This is true in sprinting, combat sports, lifting, and what-have-you.   If an MtF person, whose muscles, tendons, and bones have \"soaked\" in high levels of testosterone for years and years, transitions, the physical advantage does not just disappear. The bone density, contractile strength of their muscles, and even their work capacity, though they won't remain as high after hormone replacement, will still be superior to those of the average female. Even if you can demonstrate that they regress to the average female levels post-transition, the bone structure and stature of a person are fixed, and the male skeleton is inherently bigger and has better leverages for physical activity.  As has happened in the past, MtF people will not find it very hard to dominate the charts, giving cis women a severe disadvantage.  I believe MtF and FtM athletes should have their separate categories in sports, to prevent unfair handicaps.", "completion": "Obviously Ver_Void's answer takes the cake in this CMV, but I just want to add one point that is less empirical and more philosophical.   Suppose transwomen were (or end up being) actually at a disadvantage in sports.  Do you think people would be up in arms saying that they should be given a head start to make up for it?    Nah, of course not.  People would shrug and say, \"Well, it was their choice to transition.\"    But then, if a transwoman wins *anyway*, will she be celebrated?  More likely, a transwoman winning would be taken as evidence that the sports scientists were somehow wrong and transwomen really do have an advantage.  (Not necessarily by *you*, I understand, but in general.)  Fairness in sports is a cultural phenomenon.  And right now, our culture has a strong bias against the idea that a transwoman should be allowed to *win* against a female.  But why, really?  We don't freak out if a very large female with lots of testosterone wins against a very small female with no testosterone -- not even if the smaller female trains harder.  This whole question of transwomen in sports came from concerns about fairness, sure, but our cultural sense of what's fair is already biased to regard transwomen as \"not real women.\"  Our sense of what's fair is part of the problem.  There is nothing inherently unfair about a transwoman having an advantage over a female in sports -- no more so than a large woman having an advantage over a small one.  What people are really balking at is the idea that a transwoman should be compared to a female at all."}

{"prompt": "Why are my cakes so flat? My cakes have been coming out very flat lately.  They puff way up in the oven, get lots of cracks on top, and then flatten down when they cool. They don't collapse in the center, they are fairly even,  just very small and dense. I just opened a need box of baking soda,  so it shouldn't be that.  What is going on?", "completion": "Is this happening with recipes that worked well in the past? Because my first thought is that there is too much levener. The fact that the cake is rising quickly, cracking, and then collapsing points to a batter that cannot support itself. (Best to double check that you didn't mix up baking soda and baking powder. One is much more powerful than the other. So, you need to scale the levener if you wish to substantiate them.) So, the ratio of ingredients would be the most likely culprit. You can also get a batter that doesn't support itself by adding too little flour (maybe you recently switched from the scoop and sweep method to using a scale? Maybe your eggs are smaller than the ones you used previously?)  It could also be about your technique. There are various schools of thought especially around creaming butter. Personally, unless a recipe specifically says to cream the butter until it lightens in color, I keep my creaming time relatively low. There are others who default to always creaming butter for multiple minutes. There are pros and cons to each approach, but the length of time that you cream your butter has a direct effect on the texture of any baked good.  If you know that the recipe is solid, then it's probably time to blame your oven. An oven cooling down in the middle of baking will cause a cake to collapse. If you open the oven before the cake is set, then you're guaranteed to see in collapse shortly thereafter. But, you can also get a deflated cake if your oven doesn't maintain heat. You can get an oven thermometer on Amazon for ~$8 and it's well worth it. Then, you'll have objective evidence about whether or not your oven is at the correct temperature (maybe it's too hot at the start) and is maintaining temperature (maybe your oven isn't kicking on to keep the heat up).  ETA: I don't know which country you're in, but in the US, AP flour isn't standardized. Your rising then falling issue wouldn't be caused by a specific brand of flour, but the density of the cake is influenced by the brand of flour. For me, KAF results in my cakes being too dense. So, I use Gold almost exclusively and Pillsbury occasionally. Gold and Pillsbury are closer to what is called pastry flour in parts of Europe. It's almost like a hybrid between cake flour and AP flour. That said, I avoid using KAF recipes because they don't turn out well with my preferred brand of flour. (FWIW, people who use KAF flour swear by their recipes.)"}

{"prompt": "CMV: Dating and finding a relationship is easier for the average woman compared to the average man Now, this isn't a post to bash women or how dating is easy for women. It's about how when you compare the experience of the average woman compared to the average man, it's easier for the woman to find dates and a relationship.  Let's start with an example from my personal life. Last year some friend of mine broke up. So far the woman has gone on multiple dates with three different dudes one after the other. Essentially when she decides that she doesn't like one guy she just moves on to the next one in less than a week. While my male friend hasn't had a single date so far and that's not due to a lack of trying. Now even though at the end of the day they are both still single, the women at least go on dates which mean she has a higher chance to find someone compared to the man who hasn't been on a single date.  This brings me to my first point. The average woman has a lot more options compared to the average man. I remember reading a survey that said that on average women are asked about 12 times a year compared to asking less than 1 guy out. And when we introduce online dating it gets even worse. On average a woman has a match rate of 30% while a man has 0.013%. This means that statistically, women have a lot more opportunities to meet the one compared to a man. More options are better than fewer options.  My second point comes down to the average dating strategy. The average woman is a lot more passive than a man, in the man is still the one doing the asking out and trying to impress the woman. This means that women have the option to just passively exist and they just pick and choose from their options. In addition to that, they always have the option of becoming proactive and going after the guys they want if they don't like their options. Compared that to the average guy whose only option is to actively go out looking for women and initiating stuff, since if he just stayed and waited for women to approach he will remain single.  And finally, there is the problem that till about the age of 54 there are just more men than women.", "completion": "Okay, so I have to surmount this in the most obvious way possible -  **Who do you think these women are dating?**  **Men. They're dating men. The out lesbian population is smaller than the gay male one.**   The issue is that there's a lot of women who are single for long periods of time *but don't make a song and dance about it*. There are a lot of women who are single for long periods of time *but don't see it as a feminising trait*. Combine this with the fact that societally we teach that boys should be the ones to chase girls, and are we surprised that men feel agonised and that it's 'so hard to date' in comparison?  It just isn't that hard to date. It's just that a lot of men have very warped views and expectations. And with a lot of guys honestly being quite shit at dating and relationships (not their fault, they are taught the opposite of these skills growing up) it's really not hard as a guy to grow as a person, learn those skills, and begin being very attractive to women, no physical traits past basic self-care and grooming required.  Dating is hard for everyone. But I think it's the *perspective on that difficulty* that is different for guys, not the difficulty itself."}

Circuitry attached to the wires forces the wire's voltage to be either high, or low. We typically use a low voltage to represent a 0, and we use a high voltage to represent a 1.   If you wish to make a circuit that adds two binary digits, then you just need to design a circuit that outputs a high voltage when only one of it's two inputs is a high voltage. See the table below.   0 + 0 = 0  0 + 1 = 1  1 + 0 = 1  1 + 1 = 0 (well, really it's 10)  It's a bit more complex than that because, just like decimal addition, there are carries. So 1 + 1 does equal 0, but there is an additional output wire that must also be a high voltage in this case because there is a carry to the next binary digit. Being more accurate now, the circuit we seek must have two outputs such as:  0 + 0 = 0 and carry 0  0 + 1 = 1 and carry 0  1 + 0 = 1 and carry 0  1 + 1 = 0 and carry 1 (this is the 10 mentioned above)  So this is how a computer does addition. Subtraction is very similar, we just need to negate one number first, then add similar to above. Negative numbers in binary do exist, but I won't go into it here. The phrase of interest if you'd like to learn more is 2's complement.   Hope that made sense. It'd be worthwhile to understand addition, before jumping into multiplication or division."}

{"prompt": "CMV: It should be illegal for employers to ever require a doctor's note if they don't provide you with health insurance. I have seen a number of posts across Reddit (particularly r/antiwork) that how employers exploit employees when it comes to calling in sick. One such situation I have seen mentioned a lot is that employers are requiring doctors' notes on, or after taking a sick day or face punishment. I can't wrap my head around how this is not already illegal or at the very least the subject of a great many lawsuits.  If your employer does not provide you with health insurance, but still requires doctors' notes to call in sick (or face punishment) you are in a situation of forced exploitation. This forces poor people/individuals without healthcare, to choose between going into work sick or paying massive money out of pocket to see a physician just to prove that they are unfit to work. This incentives people to go to work sick. Correct me if I'm wrong but *Requiring* people to work while sick is already illegal, but this means of coercement somehow is not.  An expected rebuttal to this might be \"Well if employers can't punish people for calling in sick without a doctor's note, then people could just call in sick every day and never face repercussions. Is that what you want?\"  yes, yes, yes, 100% yes. Your job shouldn't be able to punish you more than they already do by not providing you with health benefits. If there is no employer accountability for keeping employees healthy, then there should be no expectation of employee accountability for proving health-related issues.", "completion": "This is ridiculous even if you have health insurance.

{"prompt": "Is the mortar and pestle really as prevalent/necessary as food personalities (youtube cooks, foodnetwork, etc) make it seem? (Specifically in lieu of a good food processor) I'm specifically thinking about pesto, Thai curry paste, and chimichurri; but I've also seen them promoted for Indian spice mixtures, hummus, and masa for tortillas (made fresh from nixtamalized corn). I have what I consider to be the ultimate (domestic, I'm sure it's a child's toy to most of you) food processor for stuff like that, and I have a tiny mortar and pestle that I use only for peppercorns when I make steak au poivre, and that's about all I could make with it, but it's perfect for that. I understand the difference in the mechanics of a mortar and pestle and a food processor, with the blades vs crushing, but couldn't I just run the food processor for longer? I've seen videos of chefs doing side by side taste tests and saying the texture is subtly different, but I've also seen a lot of people with...let's call them \"enhanced palates\" saying things that just plain don't apply to most people. If I were to do a side by side comparison, what difference am I looking for? (Answers more specific than just \"texture\" please. Is it smoother? Does it release more or less oils in the food? Does it just play towards the \"I worked harder on it so it better fucking taste better\" mentality?) Thanks everyone.", "completion": "> but couldn't I just run the food processor for longer?  Well no, for two reasons. First, no matter how many times you slice it, you are still slicing. At a certain point, the food matter becomes too small to be effectively sliced and just gets mixed around. There is a limit to how finely a food processor can process certain foods. Secondly, the longer you run a food processor, the more energy is introduced into the food, and the hotter the food gets. Generally this isn't an issue, but if you are running it for a long time to get the particles smaller, you are actually just cooking the food."}

Typically, in industry they want you to specialize as it is more efficient and cheaper for them. But in grad school you have to wear all the hats.

{"prompt": "CMV: The views on abortion from republicans and democrats are inverted from how they \"should\" be based on each party's overall philosophy. This is a fairly unusual view though I've seen it expressed rarely by some other people before. I find it really interesting and I would love to be challenged on it, but also perhaps make some people see where I'm coming from even if they disagree.   Based on everything I know about common views shared by individuals from the two major parties, I would except that the usual view on abortion would actually be the exact opposite from what it actually is. Meaning, I would expect Republicans to be pro-choice and I would expect democrats to be more pro-life.   Let's start with republicans. Republicans are generally more fiscally conservative, and they generally would like less tax money to go to programs like SNAP or other welfare programs. Being pro-life flies in the face of that. More babies being born, usually out of wedlock contributes to more poverty and requires a lot of help from the state to raise these children.   This next part is a little controversial, but Republicans have tendencies to have some people in their party be more racist and less friendly to Americans of other racial and ethnic groups. However, hypothetically limiting abortions would have the biggest effects in these groups, meaning more babies being born to black Americans and other non-white racial groups. Again, the really is the opposite of what Republicans actually want to see, at least a certain part of the party.  Republicans are more commonly associated with freedom and individual rights. There is a vein of libertarianism that runs through the Republican party. I would expect Republicans to say a woman's \"right to choose\" is more important. It's bizarre that it's the other way around.   Let's move on to Democrats. In general we see Democrats being more associated with being more ready to redistribute wealth to help out the \"little guy\". Democrats are more likely to be vegan for moral reasons, and stereotypically the left is very associated with hippies or \"tree-huggers\" and various things like that. Which brings me to the point - it's very hard for me to understand how the left is so pro-choice. One would thing that there would be many people who would try and stick up for the unborn babies, and that they would believe that these babies have inherent worth and should be born. The DNA is there, we known that eventually a fetus would develop into a human.   Democrats feel more comfortable limiting freedoms if it's something that will benefit people. It's democrats who want more gun control, it's democrats who feel more comfortable imposing restrictions if it means more public safety. Yet, uncharacteristically Democrats take an unusual hardcore libertarian stance on abortion, and say that the woman's right to choose is elevated above all - because the government ought to stay out of abortion! This is unusual, because Democrats are very comfortable with government regulation and government force in many other areas of life.   Many Republicans and Democrats agree that late stage abortions are a step too far, but it's always democrats who support late state abortions for the ones who do.   I could say a lot more, but I think it's time to end here. I look forward to discussing this.", "completion": "I'm going to address HOW the Republicans joined the Pro-Life movement, and I think it will help fill in some gaps as to why their views *seem* a little out of sync.  After Nixon the Republican party had a problem... they weren't very popular.  One of the things that was still heavily supported by the Republican party was a lot of racism.  But with the Civil Rights movement they knew that over time this would be less of a vote winner.  They needed something else.  Roe v. Wade was not very controversial when it passed.  Most churches didn't think abortion was against the Bible (which makes sense, it isn't).  The Catholic church was an outlier with being directly against it.  FYI Evangelicals in the 60s and early 70s used to joke about this stance and the fact that it wasn't biblical (I was in the church for the tail end of the 70s and most of the 80s).  But the small group of very vocal anti-abortion groups were starting to put together some pretty effective propaganda about abortion, and the thing about abortion is that you can get people that aren't paying attention to crank up their anger by presenting horrific situations to them and getting them to be angry at extreme scenarios.    I was in the church when this started to show up (late 70s), I was still a kid but found it strange that they could just completely swap their view on such a big issue in such a short time (it was fast).  However, I was young and impressionable and the images I was forced to look at (I not a teenager yet) did make me angry.  And the idea of a partial birth abortion was maddening.  Why are all these women just getting pregnant to KILL THEIR BABIES! IT IS INSANE.  It was, and many of these pastors and leaders and speakers were sued for lying about abortion.  They went to court (I remember reading the information, but was before the Internet so I don't have the details anymore).  I remember that under Oath they had to admit that while 'under the current laws this could theoretically be allowed, they have no direct evidence of any of these things ever happening.'  So why did they do it?  The Republican party promised to help the Evangelical church have influence over the government in return for voters that would vote without thinking about what the Republican party was actually going to do, which was going to be extremely detrimental to the lives of these people (Starve the Beast).  Everyone involved knew these stories are lies, that this army of women getting pregnant and aborting a baby for no reason at 8 or 9 months is insane and makes no sense.  But if you hit someone fast and hard with a lot of scary images and loud noises from the pulpit about the horror it engages the fear and anger responses and shuts down critical thinking.  It's very effective.  As for what did the Evangelical Church get out of it, look up the Assemblies of God.  They were a small shattered set of churches almost exclusively in the US.  Look at their history through the 80s and 90s and how they turned into an International Powerhouse church."}
{"prompt": "What is the strangest thing that happened to you during your PhD? Here is mine.  I spent three months abroad at a laboratory in Spain. The experiments required that I was there on the weekends. I only spoke a little Spanish and on weekends the university was practically empty except security, so I was often there alone.  One weekend the security guard came down to the lab and started talking in Spanish to me. I couldn't follow everything he said, but I thought he said that he had to inspect a nearby building so my building would be empty for a while.  A couple hours later I had finished for the day and went to the security desk. They have to lock you out - if I left at my own volition the doors unlock behind me and anyone can enter.  The desk was empty. No security guard.  I looked around and down the hall was an open door with light coming out. I presumed it was the security offices or something. I peered around the corner and this is what I saw: The security guard from earlier sat naked on a chair, legs crossed, staring into space. The chair was in the middle of the room. It was an office, not a changing room.  Embarassed, I walked away and was to about leave, but remembered I couldn't. I waited a few minutes and then approached again, this time making loud footsteps and knocking the wall. When I looked this time, the guard had gotten dressed and was buttoning his shirt. He asked if I was leaving and I said yes. He let me out and I left.  I told my colleagues this, and now this is has become the highlight of my stay abroad. Even my hosts and colleagues in Spain first and foremost remember this incident better than anything else from my stay.

He said \"I will not stop until I win the Nobel Prize for Computer Science\". When we told him there was no such prize, he did not believe us (obviously). After like 20 minutes of arguing we showed him online that it, in fact, did not exist. He was SHOOK. His life mission cut short because he did not bother to do basic research before declaring it.

I've noticed that some people often post things I would consider to be private or highly personal on their professional accounts, while others keep their accounts strictly for academic purposes. I have to say, I admire the courage people have in putting so much of themselves out there and enjoy learning how multidimensional people are. And it's also great for increasing awareness and visibility on a number of issues which are super important and necessary. But there are times where I think certain things are a bit cringe and may be best left not in the public space.  My question is: people of academic Twitter - why do you post such personal information and are you afraid of potential negative consequences? Are you concerned it might affect others perception of you in a negative way or your employment prospects? Or has doing this already affected you negatively in some way? Please know these questions come from a place of admiration and curiosity.", "completion": "Most of those private stories have to do with their professional lives actually: denied tenure/job impacts their private life, having to move for a job impacts their family and friends.

{"prompt": "Denied the ability to record absence as FMLA time off, and subsequently terminated for the absence. [MO] MO  Earlier this year, I was approved for intermittent FMLA time off at my previous job. For context, I worked from home for a call center. I got this job during the beginning of Covid, and worked strictly remotely. I had actually only been to the office to pick up my work computer.  Things were going well, and I was able to address a lot of my health issues.  One Friday at work, I had to take off from 4-6 PM for medical issues. Typically, I would call an automated phone system and be able to record the absence reasoning as FMLA, but unfortunately that phone line was down.  I called multiple times with no luck.  Most of the time, I would\u2019ve been able to contact my supervisor, but of course she gets off work at 4.  I had no ability to report the absence.  My next shift was the following Monday, and that morning I get a message from my manager who seemed frantic about my absence.  I told her the situation that I took FMLA time off, the phone lines were down, and I was going to ask her to change it. She messages me that HR was denying her to change my absence to unexcused to excused?  A hour later, I get called into a meeting, and my supervisor told me since I missed those 2 hours that I was terminated immediately.  I didn\u2019t know what to say. I was confused since there hasn\u2019t ever been a problem before.  Later, I had the company conduct an internal investigation for any FMLA violations. They found that my termination did not violate any FMLA laws, and that I was fired for the absence being unexcused. In that same email they attached their attendance policy which they claim I violated.  In the policy, it says \u201cEmployees must notify the reasoning for absences by the end of their next scheduled work day\u201d.  I asked for it to be changed to FMLA, but simply was denied the ability. If the phone line had been up and running, I would have never been terminated!  I didn\u2019t have any performance issues or anything.  I\u2019ve learned a lot about FMLA law after losing my job, and this doesn\u2019t seem right to me.

I can't communicate with any of my doctor's fluently enough to fully understand what is going on. I usually rely more on the paperwork and printouts they give me which I can translate on my own time.

{"prompt": "UPDATE: My landlocked neighbors, the sheriff and me So many people have been asking for an update and so I wrote something up and had my lawyer review it just so people can stop bombarding my inbox.  He made some changes and cut it down a bit but here is the approved statement (TL;DR at end for the impatient):  Original post here  So when we left off last, my neighbors had resorted to actually parking on my land in order to block me in and were using the police to try to strong arm me into giving into their demands.  Thanks to the suggestions here, I set up a meeting with a highly recommended real estate lawyer in the area.  We discussed the entire situation and he suggested a few options for trying to resolve this whole mess.  He warned that lawsuits, especially about land rights, can take years and years to work through the courts and of course, that means they cost a fortune.  Instead, as a cheaper and faster alternative, he suggested that the neighbors and we go to what's called \"non-binding mediation\".  As he described it, it's a process where both sides meet and a neutral mediator tries to find a \"middle ground\" that everyone can agree on.  If they do, some sort of contract is written up and everyone signs it.  This way you can avoid the time and expense of a lawsuit.  So we figured, why not give it a shot since there was really nothing to lose at this point.  So my lawyer makes the arrangements with the neighbors directly and although it was not an easy or quick process, they eventually agreed.  Then there were more weeks spent trying to agree on a mediator.  Once that was finally done, we set up a date last week at some other lawyer's conference room for everyone to meet.  My lawyer spent a lot of time preparing and discussing the various possibilities and outcomes and going in, I was super nervous and second guessing the decision not to just file a lawsuit.  But my lawyer was really great and assured that this was the best decision for this kind of situation.  So on the way into the meeting, we get stuck in the elevator together on the way up.  No one says a word and they just looked like they wanted to kill me right there in the office.  We get out and are eventually split into two separate rooms, and are told to meet in the conference room when we were ready.   So after calming me down again, we head into the main room and the mediator, another lawyer, introduces himself to everyone and explains the process.  Immediately, the neighbors start giving him a hard time and asking him questions that basically accused him of working for us.  But he stayed calm and kept repeating that he was neutral and that while he hoped to broker a resolution, he did not work for either side and it was entirely up to the parties how this would end.  And so began World War III, right there in the conference room.  My neighbors, true to form, proved to everyone in the entire building that they were plum crazy with all their red-faced ranting and raving and yelling, most of which was directed at our lawyer and the mediator.  So we get split up into separate rooms again I guess to try to calm things down.  It's now been a half hour in the separate room and I am just about to tell my lawyer to pull the plug on the whole thing when the mediator comes to our room by himself and says he has a proposal.  He explains that he was able to calm the neighbors down and got the feeling that this wasn't just about them landlocking themselves, but rather them feeling that somehow, I had taken advantage of them!    He quickly explained that he did not agree with their \"assessment\" but it was his job to find some middle ground anyway.  So my lawyer asked him what their proposal was.  The mediator says that the neighbors were willing to go after their seller for an \"easement by necessity\" and not use my land (or block my gate), but that they could not currently afford to pay for a lawyer to file the lawsuit they needed.    Worried, I asked what they wanted to get from me out of this whole deal, since this seemed almost too good to be true.  Even my lawyer was surprised.  So the mediator takes a deep breath and warns us that we're probably not going to like the offer, but that it was just the first offer and that everything was still potentially negotiable.  Really worried now, we ask again what the neighbors wanted.  The mediator says \"As I explained, [the neighbors] can't afford to pay for a lawsuit right now, so they would like you to pay for it in exchange for them abandoning their claim to use your land.\"  I was too dumbfounded to even say anything, but my lawyer had the presence of mind to ask just exactly how much these lunatics expected me to pay them to go away.  That's when the mediator pulled his chair up real close to us, leaned in, and said \"about three fiddy\".  And that's right about when I realized that our neighbors were a three hundred foot tall monster from the paleolithic era.  Let this be a lesson to you all - be careful who you ask for updates!  **TL;DR**  Hired lawyer.  Tried to avoid lawsuit via mediation.  Crazy neighbors finally agreed but, as expected, showed their true colors.  Now I need to find change for a dollar.", "completion": "YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE!! I HATE YOU WITH EVERY FIBER OF MY BEING!!!

{"prompt": "My father died two months ago. My half sister says that his assets totaled less than $5K and barely cover the expenses related to his death. Is it worthwhile to get a lawyer? I live in Washington. My father lived in another state and worked for the same company for 20 years. He had five children. Myself and four half-siblings from a previous marriage. He and my mother divorced when I was young and he more or less disappeared from my life. At the time of his death, he and I were estranged. The same was true of his relationship with three of my four half siblings. My oldest sister however, had a close relationship with him. She chose to handle everything related to his death and his estate. My siblings and I signed documents making her the executor.   He did not have a will at the time of his death. She claims that he had no life insurance policy, and that his 401k totaled less than 5K. I believe that this may be false. I know that he made a fair amount of money and do not see why he would not have been contributing to his retirement during his long career. It does not make sense to me. I also recall him mentioning many times that he had a life insurance policy that would take care of us when his time came. My sister claims this is not the case.   The question is, what should I do? I have no valid reason to believe she is lying and do not want to accuse her of wrongdoing. However I do know that death has a way of bringing out the worst in people.

{"prompt": "Is there a better way for society to determine how many PhDs to train/award each year? The rates of PhD holders obtaining a meaningful career in academia have declined precipitously.  This makes one wonder whether we are making too many PhDs, which in turn makes me wonder how would we make the \"right\" number in the first place?    Should society even care about making too many PhD holders, or should society look at this the same way we might think society is buying too many iPhones?", "completion": "We need *more* PhDs, not fewer.   Human knowledge has progressed far past the point where an undergraduate education can offer anything even remotely meaningful about the state of our knowledge, *in every field.*  The days of Albert Einstein, where a brilliant guy with a BA can contribute to a field like Physics are long gone.  Physics doesn't work like that anymore.   But neither does Anthropology or English Lit.  The history that I teach to my undergrads is *extraordinarily* dumbed down:  my smartest history major will struggle to comprehend my most recent book... and will certainly not understand it enough to offer any critique or insight about it.  They'd need 3 years of coursework just be able to engage with the argument.     It is *impossible* to understand modern science without a Phd;  just as it is *impossible* to understand modern social science or humanities fields without a PhD.     That is simply the specialization of modern knowledge.     It is an advantage.  In fact, it is the only way that humanity has even a chance of surviving.  (see also:  climate change;  international relations vis-a-vis bioweapons;  etc.)   If we had more climate-science trained PhDs, for instance, and fewer oil company execs, we would not be headed towards extinction.   The problem is (as you sort-of hint at), our society has indeed not created enough positions for most PhDs to have careers in their speciality (be it Physics or History).   Strangely, we've created plenty of positions for brokers and hedge-fund traders... who soak up the best minds for the crucial goal of... redistributing wealth to the wealthy.  (!)  Making the rich richer, and giving the smart a cut of this to bribe them in.   This is a catastrophic social failing.... a failing that, if only we had *more* PhDs in the Social Science and Humanities--fields which grapple with social and cultural organization, and don't parrot centuries-outdated paradigms (Smith, Rand)--we would be actually able to try to correct.    But given the current (mis-)apportionment of social resources (with the best minds sucked into wealth-reallocation rather than knowledge-creation) what do we *do*?    In STEM fields, PhDs can contribute to the advancement of knowledge, and then transition into \"industry\"...i.e. do their time in knowledge-producing fields, then shift over to the more socially-permissible wealth-reallocation.   This is not ideal, but it is better than nothing, and it's one reason why STEM-based technologies continue to advance so rapidly.   (If we cut off the PhD spigot, biotech and most  other innovative and/or money-making tech areas would screech to a halt.)    Again, this \"transition\" (to industry) model is not ideal... but better than nothing, given our society's messed-up priorities.    It's the Social Sciences and Humanities that offer the most challenge.  These PhDs are *necessary.*  (without progress in the knowledge in history, for instance, we'd still be socially-crippled by 19th century narratives...) And we need MORE of these PhDs, not less!!  But there's less space for them.   (tangential note:  this is not accidental.  PhDs are the ones who have the intellectual tools to challenge the mis-allocation of paying positions to pro-wealthy wealth distribution fields... ahem.)    A temporary solution is to follow the Europeans (who, as in most social/cultural areas, are ahead of the rest of the world), which is:   promote PhD work as a recognized first-step in careers such as politics, law, etc.   In many countries of the EU (especially Germany), a PhD in History is the most viable credential to enter politics.  (as it should be.)   But PhDs in various social- and humanities fields are often considered crucial to get high-ranking government positions as well.  And often, you need a graduate degree in Social Science or Humanities just to study law...which is how it should be.  (American lawyers, who become judges, and American politicians--who largely have law degrees--are all shockingly ignorant about the way the world actually works.... the study of law is so technical as to be almost vocational... it's not an entry-point into social/cultural knowledge.  But I digress...)   A model here for Americans is the State Department:   PhDs are strong credentials there, and--shocker!!  spoiler alert!- it's the most sophisticated, most successful, and (frankly) most intelligent branch of the US Federal government by far.   So I guess I'm challenging your entire framework.  We don't need to cut more PhD training slots.  We need to AGGRESSIVELY get more of our PhDs into the broader economy.   As a first step.  (toward reallocating wealth from brokers to intellectual endeavors)   Every single one of my PhD students (I'm in history) who winds up in government, or at an NGO, or in public policy, or in public education (museums, libraries, community organizations) is a WIN for my field.  More PhDs."}

At one point in my life, I ate out alone a lot because of business travel.  My strategy was to find breakfast and lunch places that I liked, then fit my meal timing, tipping, and attitude into that place.  I developed a family at those places.  For dinner, I moved around, bringing reading material to use if needed.  Mainly though, I found that if I was open to the immediate experience, the people around me kept me engaged in the social aspect of a meal.  Now, I am cooking for 2 which I had only done in the first year of marriage.  Then the other was a young man, who could happily consume 4000 calories a day and still be skinny and a bit hungry.  The second person now is my youngest child, a senior in high school girl, who at heart believes anything over 1200 calories a day will require bariatric surgery and has been vegetarian, vegan, and vegetarian in the last two years.  As a cancer survivor with absorption issues, I have been doing a lot of cooking for one and have been fiddling with the fact that in August, I will be cooking for one all the time.  The one thing that I now know is that stages/stopping points matter to me.  I can make a curry right up to the point I add the veg and stop to divide it into 3 meals.  Slap two into the freezer, then add spinach to one.  Different veg (and associated tweaking of flavor) makes two different meals from the same base.  Poached chicken yields stock and meat that both have infinite possible destinations. Quick pickles round out a meal without daily attention.

When I get frustrated with quantities for one, I check with my church to see who might benefit from a meal delivered."}

{"prompt": "CMV: The current ideas around sex/gender is just confusing as well as arbitrary and most people, specially younger ones, who identify based on these views are really confused.    The current views on sex/gender specially on Reddit and in \"educated\" circles is well known. I am not going to try and go into too much detail because I think we are all aware of most arguments out there, to simplify they go along the lines of; there are many genders with which you can identify, and the way you identify can change and evolve.  Let me say one thing, I have no problem with how you identify, I will address you however you want to be addressed, live your life however you want, it does not affect me and it is not really my business. With that being said I think people are just confused and all of this is becoming too confusing as well as arbitrary to the point of it all losing meaning. Here are some examples I came across on Reddit which made me go \"hmm\";  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/ttmtbm4h60091.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e53bcdb7a3759035fe258b661fc2716398a80f62  This was on r/pansexual, the question was \"Why do you identify as Pansexual over Bisexual?\" I came across the post on a friends Instagram and decided to take a look. Because I thought to myself I don't know the difference between these. I was quite surprised by the answers like you can see above, seems they don't know or care either. People, probably younger ones too, are identifying with a gender because they \"like the flag better\". Why do genders even have flags is a different topic of conversation but it is clear these people are confused and make the \"choice\" in an extremely arbitrary fashion. A choice which is supposed to be rather important to their identity.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/x4rypcpi60091.png?width=692&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=14d96afe12e7b0e4f2f6bd9435aa52b5c2a18293  Here is another example from the same place. Someone says \"if you are nice to me I will like you\", well that is pretty much every human being regardless of gender. It really has nothing to do with gender. Another says because it is my nickname and it is funnier.  To sum up, people think everything should be about gender when it comes to interacting with people these days and it is getting more and more confusing and arbitrary to the point of it all losing meaning.", "completion": "I think what you are seeing among young people is that they are finding who they are, how they want to express that, and who they are attracted to. People's identities change over time, and particularly as they are maturing. Young people have *always* been confused about sex, it's almost definitionally a part of adolescence.  That young people especially are \"confused\" is normal. It's just that we had structures in place when I was younger and when my parents were younger that made it especially uncomfortable--and often dangerous--to express that confusion or that set of interests and identities. The default was you should just \"man up\" or \"act like a lady,\" and this had a set of narrowly prescribed (and proscribed) behaviors around them--those that excluded a range of feelings many people were experiencing.  In sum:  1. Yes, young people often encounter confusion around their sexual desires and identities. This is not new. 2. What is relatively new is that there is more acceptance, at least among enlightened, or \"educated\" as you say, groups around the diversity of gender expressions and orientations people have.  The examples you give, as others have already noted, are largely playful expressions of that confusion and a fraught public dialogue around \"What *are* you?!\" This is *especially* true among bi- or pan- youth who have been ostracized from mainstream heteronormativity, and then in some cases marginalized further by mainstream gay/lesbian discourses.   When you say \"current ideas around sex/gender is just confusing\" it is a great first step to examine your own sexuality and figure out what you find confusing. While that confusion is common among young people, it's far from uncommon among older folks, and worth engaging to see whether you are comfortable with the ways in which you express your own sexuality. And you can be thankful that you will be slightly less judged by society as a whole for how you may decide to express that."}

{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old: How did we decide the value of a single unit, such as 1 watt or 1cm?", "completion": "It depends on the unit.  Originally most units were defined in terms of an artifact\u2014a physical object that you can measure.  You define that that object is the perfect representation of the unit in question, then you measure everything else relative to that (or relative to some other measurement apparatus that you've calibrated against the perfect artifact).  A notable exception to this is the second.  You can measure the length of one day, then divide it into 24 equal pieces (hours), then each of those into 60 equal pieces (minutes), then each of those into 60 equal pieces (seconds).  This allows people far apart to standardize their definition of how long a second is.  The big problem with this approach is that as science marches forward you get better and better at measuring things.  At some point you get good enough at measuring time that you can tell that the length of a day varies by just a little from day to day.  This has pushed most units to be defined in terms of more universal things.  For example, the second is now defined as \"the length of time it takes for <very large number> of periods of oscillation of the radiation emitted from <specific isotope of cesium>.\"  Anyone anywhere in the world can set this up and get exactly the same length for a second.  Similarly, the length of a meter used to be defined as the distance between two marks on a platinum-iridium bar, but now it's the distance that light travels in one second, divided by the speed of light.  This means that the speed of light is *exactly* 299,792,458 meters per second by definition.  These days the one fundamental unit that is not defined in a way like this is the kilogram.  The international standard kilogram is a lump of platinum and iridium, and we can tell that its mass is changing over time (which means that the definition of a kilogram changes, since the item is always 1 kg exactly, by definition).  There are various calls to change this definition to something more universal, but thus far none has gained enough traction to overturn the long-standing definition.  That covers the base units, but there's still derived units like the Watt.  For this you just combine base units.  For example, a Watt is one Joule per second.  A Joule is one Newton \\* meter.  A Newton is one kilogram \\* meter / second^(2).  If you know kilograms, meters, and seconds then you can come up with the magnitude of a Watt.  Then there are units that are just multiples of the base unit, like cm.  Here you just take the base unit and scale it, so 1 cm = 1 meter / 100.  Finally, there are completely separate unit sets, most notably Imperial.  In this system these days you actually have units defined in terms of their SI counterpart.  One inch is defined as *exactly* 2.54 cm.  This means that as long as you can follow the procedure to generate a standard meter you can also find the value of an inch.  Each time one definition is replaced by another there is a lot of effort put into making sure that the new definition is essentially the same as the old one, just with more precision.  This is why you get things like the meter being defined as the distance light travels in one second, divided by 299,792,458, not just 300,000,000."}
{"prompt": "Is 32 too old to start down the path of becoming a physicist? I am having a late in life love affair with physics. Five years ago  I was turned on to a few videos that explained Einstein's thought experiments. Since that time, what seemed like a passing fancy has become a full blown addiction.    About six months ago I decided that I ought to see if I could curb this obsession by focusing on what I thought was the less sexy side of the profession.

I am really interested in acoustics.  I wish I could find a way to spend the rest of my life exploring a topic like that. Honestly, every single sub-branch of physics that I have come across is fascinating. I have a bachelors and a JD already. Unfortunately my bachelors is in international relations. Yes, I was the guy who didn't think anything was interesting in college, and I am ashamed of how I spent that time.    Am I insane?

{"prompt": "CMV: It is morally wrong to allow a baby to be born with a serious mental/physical birth defect, and the more morally right option is to abort it. For the summer, I am working at a sleep over camp that hosts different events per week. This week is what is known as \u201cbridge camp\u201d which means it\u2019s for children with special needs. The primary affliction here is Down Syndrome, however there are also kids with autism, major OCD, cerebral palsy, and a handful of others. After watching these kids for a few days, it is incredibly obvious to see that they suffer. We\u2019ve had an incident where some silverware was dropped in the kitchen, and a child with a sensitivity to sound started to panic because of it. It took nearly half an hour for him to calm down, and he had to be separated from the other campers so he wouldn\u2019t worry anyone else. We also have a lake, and the children are allowed to swim in it (under intense supervision of course). All was going well until a girl felt something brush up against her leg, panicked, and started to push her helper camper under water in fear, trying to get out of the water. If a few other helpers didn\u2019t jump into action quickly, I\u2019m sure that helper would have drowned, due to the size of the special needs girl compared to her. While I agree all life is important, what right do people have to decide that someone needs to live their entire life this way? Fear and panic are absolutely no way to live a life, especially for someone that doesn\u2019t understand the world around them. I think that making the decision to force a child to live with something so damning is wrong, and it would be better to simply abort the fetus early, if the condition is known about. Otherwise you\u2019re cursing your child to suffer all throughout their lives.", "completion": "Where would you draw the line, that's the question. Do blind babies get aborted? What about babies with Asperger's syndrome? Are people who are genetically prone to depression allowed to have children in your world?  I work with someone with Down's Syndrome and to be honest he seems unhappy most of the time (I think he's just intelligent enough to realize his limitations, which must be incredibly frustrating), but I have seen him have happy moments.  I get abortion being a reasonable choice when you're talking about extreme defects, but I'd hate to live in a world where people chose to only give birth to \"perfect\" children. Just because someone is born with a handicap doesn't mean their life isn't worthwhile necessarily. I also think society would lose some element of empathy if there wasn't anyone who needed others to look after them."}
{"prompt": "Does turning a box of icecream on its side with the top off make it melt faster? I have been pondering this with my grandpa. He usually does this to make it melt faster. It does seem logical; given that cold air is heavier than warm air, it would presumably \"spill\" out, or the air that has been cooled in the heat exchange will fall down and allow new warm air to exchange heat. But maybe the thermodynamics are more complicated than that.", "completion": "I agree with the argument saying that the contact with countertop increases temperature.   Another reason could be that you\u2019d increase the pressure applied on the ice cream towards the side of the box, since that side would be supporting more of the weight. As pressure decreases the melting point, this might also cause the ice cream close to that side to melt faster. Sure, if you didn\u2019t turn the box on its side and kept it upright, the same would happen with the ice cream at the bottom. But, unless you\u2019re already at the end of the box, they are not accessible, are they? Sides, on the other hand, are completely accessible and yours to enjoy."}

For context her dad (my grandad) worked on the canals in the UK and he would sometimes be given small amounts of the food that was being transported on the barges. As many foods were rationed during the war, treats were few and far between and obviously one of these has stuck in her memory.

{"prompt": "CMV: until college is made free in the USA, canceling student debt is useless and selfish Let me start by saying that I am for passing both free public education and student debt forgiveness together. My issue is there are a lot of people who only advocate for one and I think it is damaging to the movement.  As someone who is about to pay off his student debt after 15 years, I can say I'm not really mad about the concept of cancelling student debt even though I sacrificed and saved for all of college and ever since on. It's definitely unfair to people in my situation but the focus should be on future generations not having to go through the same thing.  That's why student debt cancelation is useless without first making public college free. It helps a very small amount of people compared to sustained programs that could last centuries. Its leaving younger generations out to dry. It's very low impact compared to government paid tuition.  The rationale needs to be, education is a human right and thus college should be free and it is only right to forgive student debt.   This is the major problem with the left replicating itself in a new way.  People are only looking out for themselves which makes it impossible to create a winning coalition. Everyone in the left has their own issue and then Biden or Hillary wins the primary because the issues become secondary.", "completion": "We get this one a lot here.  The general gist is that unless we address the root cause of the problem, anything we do to treat the symptoms or effects of the problem is misguided.  While that is true to an extent, the reality is that people are suffering from the effects of the problem _right now_, and addressing the root cause years from now won't help that one bit.  Someone who is suffering under tens of thousands of student loan debt and is unable to start their adult life (buy a house, start a family, etc.) isn't going to be helped by fixing college tuition for _future_ students.  They need help with the debt, not a solution that would have been great 10 years ago when the debt was accumulated.  Take an analogy - if an overweight man goes into the ER having a heart attack, we don't convene a panel of doctors to talk to the man about how he should have had a better diet or exercised more to avoid this heart attack.  No, what we do is we treat the heart attack the man is having and _then_, once that immediate threat is over, we talk to him about improving diet and exercise so it doesn't happen again.  We absolutely need to address the issue with college tuition in this country, but that is a long-term fix that will take years to implement and decades to see the benefit from.  Absolving a portion of student debt can be done _today_ and will have positive effects _today_, so there is no reason to wait."}

{"prompt": "Everything I read insists that you must rest a grilled steak for 10 min, but then the steak isn't hot when j eat it. I've experimented with tin foil the resting meat but I find it tends to further cook it, maybe even steaming it, ruining the crust I worked so hard on. Please help.

When you rest meat the crust will always get a little soggy, but it is really easy to re-crisp the steak by heating some of the leftover fat from the pan and pouring it over just before serving, alternatively if you are grilling and don't have leftover fat in the pan you can use the broiler setting on your oven for 20 seconds."}

Was more modern media like film/TV just poorly preserved, was it somehow lost, or are officers on the Enterprise just kind of pretentious?", "completion": "Sherlock Holmes, 20\u2019s gangster serials, hard boiled detectives, Horatio Hornblower etc. were never considered high art, they were considered trashy lowbrow pulp fiction, not unlike Twilight. Even Shakespeare was considered popular entertainment for the masses, unlike the supposedly more sophisticated Greek tragedies. Picard definitely wasn\u2019t being pretentious, quite the opposite in fact  I\u2019d chalk it up more to just personal taste. Janeway liked role playing as an old timey governess and chatting with Da Vinci, Tom Paris liked schlocky 60s B movie sci fi, Sisko liked baseball, Mariner liked murdering her coworkers etc.  It\u2019s also worth noting that human pop culture comes to a full stop some time in the 90s because of the Eugenics Wars. They never got their Breaking Bad and Marvel movies and Call of Duty and Twilight and whatnot. What they got were superhuman Augmented tyrants like Khan, and decades of brutal nuclear warfare, deprivation, and totalitarian rule. All the time travel/flashback/Q episodes depict the 21st century as varying flavours of hellish and impoverished, much more so than the real life 21st century  That\u2019s why \u201cmodern\u201d Federation people don\u2019t appreciate what we consider to be contemporary media - they never had those things in the first place. 21st century arts and culture in the Trek verse probably consisted of things like stale Augment warlord propaganda about dying in battle for the Glorious Leader and depressing subversive poetry about how the radioactive corpse and cockroach stew tastes bad after mother was dragged away to the slave mines.   Federation folk like the culture that was popular in the mid 20th century (including works written earlier like Sherlock Holmes and Shakespeare\u2019s plays), because that was the pinnacle of human civilisation and cultural development before they crashed and burned, were rescued by the Vulcans, then emerged as the comparatively boring, saccharine sweet root beer swilling utopia that was the Federation. Fiction from that era occupied that Goldilocks zone of excitement that came from a culture where scarcity and adversity was common - but not to the extent of the Eugenics Wars and the post apocalypse that came after"}

To me, the concept of \"love\" as we express it commonly is bigger than the roots of the emotions that we can verify.

{"prompt": "CMV: Having a UBI for all people reduces the need for minimum wage and gives everyone more freedom for employees and employers alike. UBI for those that don't know, is a concept that involves a basic income for all people that is handed out by the government. It would be enough to cover only living expenses such as rent, basic food and basic bills. Many countries have taken the idea seriously enough to have pilot programs to test UBI with pretty positive results.  In a world where unemployed people have enough to survive on, the power to turn down exploitative work is very valuable.  On the flipside, it opens up jobs that normally wouldn't be worth it for the employers unless they pay very little. As an example, food delivery jobs such as doordash/skip do not typically pay enough to live on and are typically done as a secondary job. If every job you do isn't to survive but rather to improve your quality of life, it could be much more rewarding. You do it to build up your wealth rather than to avoid getting behind.  Other benefits of UBI worth mentioning are reduced crime and violence, reduced drug and alcohol abuse, improved mental health and less overall stress.  It also goes without saying that AI and automation will replace more work every year. Even if most people keep working and more jobs are created, the hours we work are decreasing, and that can be a good thing.", "completion": "I dont think most people appreciate how much of a disaster UBI would be. You have to consider the unintended consequences of how it would play out.  For example, suppose a 3 bedroom townhouse rents in your area for $2000/mo. That means there are enough people in your area w $2000/mo that they can put towards rent. Now give everyone an extra $2000/mo of UBI. The people who could previously afford $2000/mo can now afford $4000/mo. So, what happens to rent for that 3 bedroom townhouse... it goes up to $4000/mo. Rents skyrocket.  The people who benefit most are home owners. UBI doesn't affect their monthly mortgage, cause it's locked in. So they now have an extra $2000/mo to spend on a new car or a vacation or food or whatever. So the price of those things goes up. If your a renter, it's then much harder for you to buy a car or go on a vacation or whatever, too.  So, what do renters do? They push to buy a house. But now every other buyer has an extra $2000/mo that they can put towards a house, so prices get even more jacked up than they already are. Great for current home owners but sucks for renters.  The last thing to think about is where is all that money going to come from? Roughly 300 million adults in the US. To give them each $2000/mo, it would cost $600 billion per month, or 7.2 trillion dollars a year!! That is twice as much as the US collects in taxes each year, and that money is already used for other things. Even $1000/mo of UBI is totally unrealistic financially for the government.  Lastly, pilot programs are a terrible way to evaluate UBI. if you gave 100 people $2000/month it will be awesome for them. But, if you give everyone the same amount (making it universal), it's a mess."}

{"prompt": "Are there any moral problems with the stance that getting to Heaven is based solely on faith and moral actions have no bearing on it? I was raised around this belief that Heaven is secured only for those who have faith and that one's moral actions don't matter in terms of getting to Heaven. Obviously they still subscribed to the view that morality was objective and there was objective conditions for morality, it just had no bearing on whether you are going to Heaven.  I haven't looked much into moral philosophy but I already feel like there holes with such an outlook, one being that God, for all intents and purposes, might actually be supporting morally objectionable behavior. It was very common in church to think that Hitler, if he had repented right before killing himself, would be in Heaven (something which I find absolutely detestable).  How does one go about critiquing this sort of view?", "completion": "The fact that moral deeds aren't what is meant to bring salvation is a consequence of the doctrine of grace, which holds that when humans act rightly, it is through the direct intercession of God, so that no human unaided can act rightly. So, the only way to do moral actions is to do then with the grace of God. Augustine is the person who championed its acceptance as a tenet of Christianity, and it continues to be one in Protestant and Catholic Christianity alike (it's less important, or held in a less severe fashion, in Orthodox Christianity). Protestant and Catholic understandings of grace differ quite a bit, and this is of the main places that the two traditions split from each other (hence the mention of Sola Fide elsewhere in the thread). It means that when you want to see why the claim that moral deeds can't garner salvation, you can (and should) look into the reasons why Pelagianism is a heresy (Pelagianism is the view that moral deeds can garner salvation), or the extensive and sophisticated discussions of the doctrine of grace in its own right.  There is an epistemic problem with the doctrine of grace, which is that of an action is good only though the direct intercession of God, then it means that nobody who hasn't seen grace in action would be able to learn what good action is like, from a lack of examples. But our moral concepts, especially our virtue concepts, are in actuality learnt from repeated everyday experience: compassion or honesty or the like isn't some exceptional thing, but a feature of our everyday lives. For communities that are already diffuse with the kind of faith in question, this isn't a problem, but we know that people learn virtues in much the same way across societies, whether they have any Christian faith or not, and all societies understand the virtues in robustly similar ways. So, either the virtues, which are meant to be our moral categories most directly involved in recognising good action is not concerning good action after all (which is incredible, since the Bible and all Christian authors, Augustine included, is shot through with virtue talk), or there is some imperceptible difference between the good actions of Christians and non-Christians which matters for salvation but not for learning what good action is like (which is again incredible and again speaks against how Christians are meant to learn and teach the goodness of Christ), or everybody has grace as a default (which sends to defeat the point, and also is another heresy, universal salvation), or the doctrine of grace is false. None of these options are attractive on reflection."}

There was a pediatric ophthalmologist who had a case where a kid had a firework explode into his eye.

The only instance I\u2019ve heard of the eye \u2018attacking itself\u2019 (other than predisposed factors) is as a result of ocular trauma, this case being a textbook example. I tried to get her to explain why afterwards and remember it had something to do with cranial nerves and the optic chiasm.  Thinking the brain would send signals to the traumatized eye, the chiasm interferes with the signaling, and subsequently causes blindness in both eyes. Essentially both optic nerves/discs become severed from the rest of body as the body\u2019s method of protecting itself. In theory goes back to the \u2018self\u2019 and \u2018non-self\u2019 in immunology, your body is not going to recognize it anymore and will try to protect the rest of the body from the damaged or now foreign signals.

But at present, in the USA, more people are dying from COVID every day than are from car accidents. If you have a patriotic or sympathetic bone if your body you should be ok with wearing a mask in indoor public spaces when required.

On the flipside covid isn't all that deadly and most people dying from it are basically dying of old age and covid was just the straw that broke the camels back. Being young and healthy and you know not morbidly obese covid is no real threat to me, I'm also pretty sure I already got it once or twice.   There's also the effectiveness of the thing to consider, a mask reduces the spread somewhat but you're still spreading it and it's not like you'll not get it if everyone wears a mask it just means it'll spread slower not differently on the flip side a seat belt is an insanely effective safety device, it turns certain death into something you can walk away from, masks aren't even close to that efficient. Sure you can argue it's theoretically possible for both to safe your life but then why not mandate everyone wear a bulletproof vest in chicogo because of drive by shootings? Effectiveness matters."}

There is no symbol for two in binary, exactly how there is no symbol for ten in decimal. \"On\" or \"off\" simply refers to '1' or '0' in binary.  Just to make sure that makes sense (as its super important):  01 = one;  10 = two;  11 = three;  Make sense? Cool (if not google \"binary\").  Ok, now for something completely different, but related.  Theres something in computer theory called a \"logic gate\". It's a device. It has two inputs, and one output. The only input it accepts is \"on\" or \"off\", and the output is the same, \"on\" or \"off\". You might see the relation to binary.  A logic gates output is based on its input. An example of a logic gate is a \"AND\" gate. When both of the inputs are on, the output is on. Otherwise, the output is off.   You still with me? Don't worry, the cool stuff is coming soon.  Another logic gate is the \"NOT\" gate. The NOT gate has one input. If the input is off, the output is on, and vice versa. The output is *not* the input. Get it?   Now, if we put the input of a NOT gate on the output of an AND gate, we get a NAND gate. Creative, I know. We nerds don't get out much.  Anyways, try to figure out what the output would be for all the four different possible combinations of the two inputs for the NAND gate.  Anyways, heres what a NAND gate looks like drawn.   Now, you have probably heard of computer memory right? **ta da!**#mediaviewer/File:SR_Flip-flop_Diagram.svg)  It's not going to make total sense at first, but that diagram shows a memory-holder-thingamajig. Look at it for a while and try to figure out what it does. Basically it holds a \"bit\" of memory. You could say that a bit is like one digit of a binary number. You line a bunch of these in a row, and you can start holding numbers.  But what do you *do* with those numbers?  This is where it gets cool. You do math with those numbers. This next device is called an \"*adder*#mediaviewer/File:Half_Adder.svg)\".   The gate on top is called an XOR gate, its output is on if only one of its inputs is on. If there both on or off, then the output is off.   Now, make it a little more complex and you can add multiple bits at the same time, by linking the last ones \"Cout\" to the next ones \"Cin\".  Cool, now we have a basic calculator. How can we turn this up to 11 and make a computer?  Code.   Now, you know what data is, and so code is easy to explain. Its just data. Thats all it is. Really.   The reason why its different then other data though, is because the CPU interprets it as *instructions.*  If we wanted to do math for example, and we got to decide the instruction definitions we could use a system like;      00000001 = *add* a number to another number;      00000010 = *subtract* a number from another number;  With this, we can set what logic gates are being used based on data.   Now, real quick, memory is organized on a computer by something called memory addresses, basically they just allow the CPU to ask for memory at a specific location. Generally speaking the addresses are sized by \"bytes\" which is just another word for \"eight bits\". So if we wanted to access memory location five or whatever we could store that as '00000101'.  Lets go back and add some more to our table;  00000011 = move this data into some location;  Cool, now we can say something like:  \"add the number at location #5 in memory to the other number at location #7 in memory.\"  By breaking it down into:      (add) (memory address #5) (memory address #7)  Which is really just      00000001 00000101 00000111  Pretty sweet right?  But hold on, how does the CPU know where to get its instructions?  On the cpu, Theres a tiny amount of memory, it does various things, such as hold something called the \"instruction pointer\". The instruction pointer holds the address of the next instruction, and increments itself after every instruction. So basically, the cpu reads the instruction pointer, fetches the next instruction, does it, adds one to the instruction pointer, and then goes back to step one.  But what happens when it runs out of instructions?  Lets go back to our table. Last time, I promise:   00000100 = set instruction pointer to address  Basically, all this instruction does is set the instruction pointer to a number. You ever wonder what an infinite loop is on a computer? Thats what happens when an instruction pointer is set to instructions that keep telling the instruction pointer to set itself to that same set of instructions.  Thats computers in a nutshell."}

Shit burns on medium heat.  Washing them is a pain in the ass.  Just the thought of attempting eggs or pancakes in a steel pan gives me the chills.  The fine thin layer of overcooked batter or egg makes it impossible to flip.  When I use \"lots\" of butter or spray, sure the first batch of pancakes turns out ok.  But the second you try to cook a 2nd pancake, it sticks.  And if I reapply butter/spray, it seems to burn or build up and turn into a brownish liquid that stains the food and doesn't work as well as the first application.  Each round of lube gets progressively less and less effective.  I have to wipe the pan out and almost let it cool down after each item gets cooked.   Teflon - Can't use metal on it, understood.  However the plastic pieces I have seem to \"melt.\"  So I can never use them on high heat.  Example, making stir-fry erodes the edge of my plastic spatula.

Yes you can use fresh potatoes. Personally I prefer using Yukon golds, which I can never find frozen and which are a bit sweeter and have a better texture.

I put mine into a mixing bowl, which I then fill with water, cap with a strainer, and drain. I repeat this process 3-4 times, until the water runs clear. Then I let them sit in the strainer to get rid of any leftover water. Not too long, otherwise they\u2019ll start to oxidize and turn gray.

Do you guys think this is reasonable? Half of it is usually primary source material, half academic discourse, and then sometimes media pieces. So it's not like it's easy reading either.  And then, and I'm not upset about it but it just makes me feel a bit embarrassed/rejected, he hasn't answered my last three emails!  The first email was about something we were discussing in a meeting I had had with him. I thanked him for the meeting, sent him a picture which I had asked him a question about during the meeting, and commented about my interest in a memoir written by an academic he knows really well.  No answer. That's fine, I guess, the email didn't have any action items.  The second email was about my research proposal. I mentioned an author we had both been talking about, linked to a really interesting interview with him, and then asked the professor if he might be available to meet sometime in the next few days to help me refine some things for my research proposal, which would be due the following week.  No answer. Ouch! I was really embarrassed. After this, when I went to class, I was a bit quiet. He noticed, and he was like, you're quiet today. have you done the readings?  I was like yeah, of course I have. He said, so what's going on?  I didn't say much. But I was actually a bit hurt that he hadn't been answering any of my emails, and I was also really tired...  Anyways, I sent the third email a few days ago. In the email, I explained that I've always done the readings, all of them, take them really seriously, annotate extensively (my annotations document is about 70 pages now!), and then I mentioned that I find upwards of 200 pages of readings to be challenging (something all the classmates and I had agreed on - they were just too afraid to broach it with him), but that I still appreciated the readings and learned so much from them, and would even miss them after this class is over. I also asked if he assigns about this much in his grad classes. A few weeks ago, he'd said that I could take a grad class with him, so that's why I asked about that.  No answer!

{"prompt": "AskScience AMA Series: We've discovered that pancreatic cancer is detectable based on microbes in stool, with the potential for earlier screening in the future. AUA! Hi Reddit! We are Ece Kartal (u/psecekartal), Sebastian Schmidt (u/TSBSchm) and Esther Molina-Montes (u/memmontes). We are lead authors on a recently published study showing that non-invasive (and early) detection of pancreatic cancer may be possible using stool samples. Ask Us Anything!  Pancreatic cancer is a horrible disease: although few people develop this form of cancer, only around 1 in 20 patients survive for 5 years or longer after diagnosis. This is in part due to late detection: symptoms are unspecific and often occur only when the disease has already progressed to advanced stages, so that diagnosis if often too late for therapeutic intervention (surgery and/or chemotherapy). This makes the earlier detection of pancreatic cancer an important goal in mitigating the disease, yet no approved non-invasive or minimally invasive, inexpensive tests currently exist.  We studied a Spanish population of patients diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC, the most common form of pancreatic cancer) and clinically matched controls that were either pancreas-healthy or suffered from chronic pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas, an important risk factor for the development for PDAC). We found that a set of 27 microbial species detected in feces provide a very specific signature for PDAC patients, even in early stages. When combined with a blood serum-based cancer progression (not diagnostic) marker, prediction accuracy increased even further. We confirmed this finding in an independent German cohort, and also made sure that this microbiome signature did not falsely predict PDAC among thousands of subjects that were either healthy or suffered from other diseases. Moreover, we were able to trace some of these signature microbes between mouth, pancreatic healthy tissue, pancreatic tumors, and the gut which suggests that they may be more than just indicators.  Our study is freely available online in the journal GUT (Kartal, Schmidt, Molina-Montes, et al; 2022): https://gut.bmj.com/content/early/2022/01/26/gutjnl-2021-324755  A commentary by R. Newsome and C. Jobin in the same issue puts our work into context: https://gut.bmj.com/content/early/2022/02/21/gutjnl-2021-326710  For less formal introductions, check the press releases by one of our funding bodies (Worldwide Cancer Research) or the lead institutions EMBL Heidelberg, Germany and CNIO Madrid, Spain (text in Spanish)]( https://www.cnio.es/noticias/una-colaboracion-internacional-propone-un-analisis-de-heces-para-la-deteccion-temprana-del-cancer-de-pancreas/).  Our work is an early proof of principle and will need to be further validated on larger and independent cohorts. Yet our findings hold some promise for a future inexpensive, non-invasive screening method for pancreatic cancer. Such a screen could initially target risk groups, e.g. above a certain age or with a family history of PDAC. Ideally, with further development and in combination with other biomarkers, our approach might be developed into an actionable diagnosis method in the future. That said, none of us is a medical doctor; we cannot and will not provide any medical advice, and none of what we post here should be construed as such.  We will be on at Noon Eastern (16 UT), and are looking forward to your questions, AUA!

One thing that several people have asked already is about **timing**: when would a possible screening test for PDAC become available for patients?  &#x200B;  It is very difficult to make a prediction on this, unfortunately. Our work is early and proves principle that such a test should be feasible. However, to get this out of the academic lab and into practice, several things need to happen:  * **Validation**. This is the most important point for now. We describe a microbiome signature that worked in a well-characterised and clinically matched, yet relatively small population of Spanish patients. We validated it in a likewise small-ish German PDAC population. We further made sure that this 'signature' is PDAC-specific (i.e., does not raise a 'false alarm' in healthy people or patients with other diseases) by validating it against thousands of publicly available datasets. Yet more work will be required, on larger and geographically distinct cohorts, to establish how robust this is at scale. * **Development.** In our study, we used shotgun metagenomics -\u00a0meaning that we 'randomly' sequenced the DNA of all microbes in a stool sample to then explore which ones are predictive. This would be impractical to do as a test and would also cost $$$. Now that we know more specifically what to look for, the next step is to develop a more targeted test for only the species that *are* predictive. Such a test will be much cheaper and has to be easy-to-use for people who are not trained physicians or microbiologists. This has been shown to be possible for other diseases (e.g., colorectal cancer), but the translation will certainly take time. * **Certification and Approval.** Obviously, *if* we have a working test, it will also have to be approved by the relevant agencies before it can be used by patients.  &#x200B;  It is also important to note that all of the above costs $$$ and cannot really be done by academic labs alone. So we are working with clinicians in different places, but also with diagnostics companies to get this rolling. It is difficult to estimate how long all of this will take, but if all goes well (and as cautious scientists we have to say: that's a big *IF*), a screening test could hit shelves in 5 years or so."}

{"prompt": "What happened to my cake? https://imgur.com/a/irbalvf  What the heck happened to my cake on the left?  It\u2019s a lemon chiffon cake. The difference between the two is that the one on the left was made with AP flour because I was out of cake flour that the recipe called for. The one on the right used cake flour. I had to run out to the store after that disaster and redo the recipe. Technique was all the same.  Basically beating egg yolks to ribbon with sugar and adding stiff egg whites. Not only did the first cake collapse, but the texture was all weird and rubbery.   Does cake flour really make all that much difference?  Apparently so!", "completion": "Opened the image, and immediately knew the problem was a gluten issue. Read your post, and yup, flour used was a bit wonky. You made a weird cake bread brioche! Use cake flour next time.  A more in depth explanation would be that different flours have different levels of gluten and different particle size. Cake flour doesn't have a lot of gluten and is very finely ground. Bread, or \"harder\", flours are larger pieces and have more gluten. AP is somewhere in the middle.  Gluten and particle size are two factors that contribute to the size of the crumb, or little holes in the cake. As you can see, AP can stretch a lot more than cake flour and the crumb is much larger (Although the high moisture chiffon exaggerated this effect; a similar snafu wouldn't be as apparent in a drier recipe)  Because of the chiffon method (whipping whites and adding oil/fat) you've made a sort of cloud bread/brioche frankenstein. I'd just cut off pieces and slather it with jelly."}
{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old why does CPUs/CPU cores seem to be capped at 3 - 4 Ghz since almost a decade?", "completion": "In addition to what everyone else said, there are some fundamental physical limitations at play.  When you turn off voltage in an electrical wire, there's still some remnant current flowing through it (imagine going in a car. When you hit the brakes, it will still be moving for a while). This current lasts for a couple hundred ps (picoseconds), so the maximum theoretical frequency of conventional electronics is around 7,5 GHz. So even if we could create small enough CPUs/GPUs, we simply can't move the signal fast enough through the wires.  There are a few areas of modern physics that are trying to overcome the issue. Instead of using electricity, these methods use light to move information. The two most promising options now are plasmonics (you shine light onto a metal and the light travels along the metal's surface) and magnonics (you shine light on a magnet, you locally change it's polarity and this \"polarity wave\" travels through the material).  Explain like I'm five years old analogy: electrical wires are like a garden hose. When you turn off the water, there's still some water dripping from the hose. Plasmonics and magnonics are like throwing water balloons."}

I know what it\u2019s like to feel silenced or misunderstood by people who disagree with me politically. I\u2019ve felt the frustration of our party (Libertarians) not being allowed on the debate stage, or being told our ideas don\u2019t need to be considered because it doesn\u2019t fit within the left-right paradigm.   But I\u2019ve never felt like I hated the \u201cother side\u201d. We\u2019re all Americans. Our ship rises or sinks together. That doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t fight for our values. But it does mean we present reasoned and rational arguments, with a willingness to change our minds.   My ideas that I hold are mine, and mine alone. When I go into the grave my ideas will go with me. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t get overly attached to them being the sole correct position of how the world should operate. I believe in my values. But I believe in the rights of others to have values that differ from mine. I also enjoy learning about other people\u2019s opinions on issues. I think criticizing my own ideas sharpens my mind and makes me more knowledgeable about the issues. If someone has a differing opinion, they got their by seeing something I must not have seen. It doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll agree. But I assume they\u2019re presenting a legitimate argument based on something they\u2019ve experienced or felt.   The Democrats and Republicans to me seem to be so obsessed with being correct. They never entertain the idea that they might be wrong. This seems like a dangerous trajectory to be taking. A trajectory that necessarily makes peace impossible.   I\u2019m not saying Libertarians aren\u2019t guilty of these things, we are. But I think because we\u2019re not in a position to actually grasp the wheel of power we can see with more objectivity what this desire to wield power has done to both parties. It\u2019s gone from a genuine belief in debate and rational argumentation. To a hatred of those who disagree.  It saddens me to see us in this state as a country, and as a union. Part of being a member of a bigger system is understanding the value of compromise. It can\u2019t turn into a battle for the soul of the United States every election cycle. It\u2019s not sustainable, and more importantly it\u2019s not morally right that those who attain power feel the need to \u201cget back\u201d at those who currently don\u2019t have power.

I just don\u2019t want to see a situation where we become so morally bankrupt that we would wish failure on each other.   As a Libertarian (who might run for office one day, once I get more experience and knowledge) I want my philosophy to be one of self reflection and admission of fault.

{"prompt": "CMV: False Accusers Should Be Punished As If They Did the Crime While people making false accusations occur less often than some subreddits claim, they absolutely occur. But when it comes to light that the accusations of murder, assault, or rape were falsified, the false accusor (referred to as \"The Liar\") often is not charged or receives a much shorter sentence than the person they accused.   And to be clear, I'm not referring to people who accuse someone of a crime and the alleged perpetrator isn't convicted. Nor am I referring to someone being mistaken. I am only talking about someone lying and fabricating evidence to get someone in trouble for a crime they didn't commit.   This feels very wrong to me. The Liar attempted to get an innocent person in trouble, potentially costing them years of their life and staining the innocent persons reputation. The Liar should receive, at a minimum, the same level of punishment that would have been given to the person they lied about. It seems only fair, and would serve to put a greater deterrent to false accusations than what is currently in place.   Tl:Dr, if you purposefully lie about someone doing a crime, you should be punished just as much as someone who did the crime you lied about.   Change My View.", "completion": "Unless you can suggest a way to differentiate between malicious false accusations and those caused by mental illness, impairment, coercion, or fear, and also provide a criteria under which police even can consider something a false accusation, then it's entirely moot.  The other aspect of it is that right now, due to the difficulties listed above, whether or not a person is charged with giving a false statement (not testifying in court, which is something different) is largely discretionary. Based on what I've read, it would seem that most of the time when someone is convicted of giving a false statement, the police got a confession to such from them before it ever went to court. This would never happen if they were facing potentially long sentences in jail, and how can you allow police discretion to continue to rule if the penalty for these crimes is now potentially imprisonment for decades? Surely at some point the police will feel compelled to bring these charges against someone who they aren't totally convinced they have reasonable evidence to say beyond a doubt that they were guilty. What level of evidence is sufficient to say beyond a reasonable doubt that someone made a false accusation with malice? Would a system like this even differentiate between malicious and non-malicious offenders?  If we agree that our justice system can be manipulated to send an innocent person to jail for a serious crime by means of false accusation, that also implies that our justice system could be manipulated to send an innocent witness to jail by means of fabrication of testimony against **them**.  All this would do is have an extreme chilling effect on victims coming forward, or people giving statements or testimony against perpetrators of crimes. Why would any bystander give even a statement to the police about a murder they have witnessed, when they could be opening themselves up to life imprisonment?  TL;DR, it would be practically impossible to accurately identify those you would want this law to apply to, it would be a logistical nightmare to determine where the responsibility for determining whom to charge lay, and expecting any justice system to be infallible on these matters is absurd."}

{"prompt": "How to make Thai curry more authentic Hey,   Not sure whether this is better for /r/AskCulinary or /r/cooking but here goes.  I've never been able to make a Thai curry (red, green) in the same way as a Thai restaurant. Obviously styles differ wherever you are but I've tried Thai food in the UK, US and Singapore and it seems to consistently have a consistency which I can't crack back in my kitchen.  I generally use a sachet of red or green thai curry paste and follow the ingredients on the back (which is usually to just simmer the contents of the sachet, meat (in my case chicken) and a can of coconut milk, until the meat is cooked through). I've toyed with making my own curry pastes in the past with mixed results, but gave up when I realised that, in the UK at least, it is generally a LOT cheaper (and a lot more authentic due to lack of fresh Thai ingredients) to use a curry paste from the local oriental shop.  Whenever I try this it just ends up really watery. Once served with a bowl of rice I just end up with a puddle of water at the bottom of my dish.   I've changed the brand of coconut milk a few times and found one which seems to have a consistently greater quantity of coconut (much thicker and a greater amount of solidified coconut milk in each can) with only a minimal improvement.  I've also tried adding coconut flour (something I have on hand for indian cooking) as I know that it can have a thickening effect, or at least soaks up a lot of moisture, but that hasn't really affected the consistency either - I just get lots of coconut floating in an otherwise indifferent puddle.  Flavour-wise it's fine for my tastes - I occasionally soften some chopped onion and garlic first before adding the rest of the ingredients, sometimes chuck in any random vegetables we need to use up (carrot and sweet potato work surprisingly well), tweak the sweetness (I suppose this is a western thing), add fish sauce and lime juice to taste etc. Tastes great. But just can't nail the thick creamy consistency.   Any advice, or thoughts on a more authentic preparation would be gratefully received! Thanks.", "completion": "I've done a cooking course in Thailand and these are the things that I learned: First off, simmer your meat in conocut cream (v\u00e9ry important), the thick variant of coconut milk from the first squeeze, milk is from the second squeeze. Simmer meat until done, then mix in your curry paste (jarred etc is fine as long as the ingredients are nothing but herbs and a bit of salt/oil). Then and only then thin it out with coconut milk, add veggies and cook it a bit more to your likings. Season with fish sauce helps a lot too and add some palm sugar of brown sugar.  The coconut cream makes a huge difference. Thai curry is supposed to be a bit runny, but not watery."}

This is pissing off people and making them double down on their views. Also its driving people with those opinions away from reddit. While a lot of people prefer them not on the site, it's my view diversity of people on reddit is something very valuable because it gives insight to what and why other people are thinking. No discussion on that post was allowed. If it were allowed then maybe people might have a better understanding of eachother leading to maybe a mutual respect between the great divide of abortion.

If corporations don't like the rising costs, they can put their lobbying money into reducing them. Housing getting too expensive? Lobby and/or incentivise home builders to build more affordable housing. Healthcare getting too expensive? Lobby for socialized medicine.  I also believe minimum wage should be treated somewhat like tax brackets, where smaller companies can pay less while gigantic corporations are forced to pay more.

Because this is how you get hyper-inflation.   Think about what you\u2019re suggesting, OP. You want the government to force businesses to increase their labor costs and peg that to the price of housing which is itself a function of interest rates which are a function of prices (inflation). This is a recipe for disaster as businesses increase prices to pay for increase wages; those increase prices make the dollars in our pockets worth less; the Fed increases interest rates (the costs to borrow money) to reduce inflation; thus making housing more expensive; thereby triggering another round of minimum wage increases. Repeat until a loaf of bread is $100,000 and minimum wage is $450,000 an hour.   What command economy advocates fail to understand (and yes, the minimum wage is an anti-free-market concept) is that currency doesn\u2019t matter. Monetary value matters. Price controls don\u2019t work because the numbers in your bank account mean nothing beyond what those numbers can purchase in the marketplace. Always remember that labor is an economic market like anything else. And a minimum wage is just a price control. You\u2019re controlling the price of labor artificially.

{"prompt": "I suspect I might have participated in a rigged search, this time as a candidate! Mostly just venting but would be happy to hear others' thoughts on this. Since this is \"ask\" academia my question is: \"am I just being paranoid?\"  Several years ago I was on the search committee side of a hiring situation where the top candidate was clear to nearly all members of the committee but the provost had already decided on one person and we eventually learned that we were there just to rubber-stamp the process. I remember being livid at the time--not only had the committee's time been wasted but it felt so incredibly *unjust*. The fact that the \"chosen\" candidate was not only an arrogant ass but also less-qualified than the committee's recommend candidate made it even worse.  Fast forward to a position I recently learned I would not be offered. I went all the way through a nearly day-long (Zoom-based) \"campus\" visit, presentation, met with all department faculty individually or in small groups, conversation with the dean, etc. Early on I had my suspicions about the position (red flags listed below) but the faculty I interacted with seemed genuinely interested in me/my work and had nothing but positive feedback for me.   I was actually somewhat surprised to receive a rejection e-mail post-interview. The qualifications were quite narrow/focused but I met them all. The application window was so short I couldn't imagine that many qualified people applied, especially since it wasn't advertised in my field's typical venues. Then my thoughts turned to my own experience on the other side of the search process--I had been just as enthusiastic about the *real* top candidate as those faculty I recently met with were enthusiastic about me. Even though that previous search was truly a sham, most of the people involved in the search process weren't aware until we'd already met the candidates and discussed the pros and cons of each. What if the same thing happened here?  Anyway, maybe I'm just being paranoid, or don't handle rejection well, but...the red flags:  * The position was never listed in my field's primary job advertisement venue, only on the university's HR site and the Chronicle of Higher Ed jobs site.   * The application period was open for only one month.  * They asked if it was okay to call my references but never contacted any of them. IME in my field references are usually contacted for all finalist candidates.  * The start date was mid-academic-year and only about 3 months after the application close date. The successful candidate would need to either be unemployed or have an extremely flexible position (thankfully I have the latter) to be able to start mid-year. Or already be on campus...  * There's a long-time adjunct in this department with specific (course name/number) teaching duties identical to the courses listed in the job advertisement, with exactly the course load stated in the job ad. The adjunct's spouse has an upper-level administrative position at the same university.  Any one of these alone I would brush off, but I've been on the other side of a process that felt very similar. I also think that this happens more frequently than we might expect--I know of a handful of cases like this. In fact, now that I think of it I can think of four cases off the top of my head where I was at least tangentially affected, either on a search committee or in a department, by a rigged search that was either attempted or successfully carried out. (The score is 2-2 if you're curious).   What I suspect here is that the \"candidate\" already on campus was promised this position but according to the institution's rules, they had to do a national search. I happened upon the job listing just by chance and they had to play along; maybe having me in the pool even helped at some level. Faculty and many/most committee members were in the dark until the final \"decision\" had to be made.  As I wrote at the beginning, this is mostly just me venting. It may just be me coping with rejection. The position was really ideal, though--I've never seen such a perfect fit (from me-as-candidate point of view). This might be one of the final straws that gets me out of academia.  Thanks for reading my rant :)", "completion": "Definitely happens. I think you're right that that's what happened to you.  FWIW I've also heard of it going the the other way -- a candidate is promised a position but they just have to advertise it for legal reasons, but then the department decides they do want someone else, leaving the person the position was made for in the lurch. Ghost positions really just suck all around."}

{"prompt": "Is it Unreasonable to Work From Home One Day a Week as a Postdoc? Hi All,  So I recently started a postdoc and so far I really enjoy the research! During my PhD, my advisor was very hands off and allowed us to make our own schedule. I was good at setting my own hours and found that I worked efficiently and well by working 4 long days in lab (12-15 hr days) and working from home one day a week doing writing, reading, data workup, experiment planning, etc. I really liked this schedule as it allowed me to principally focus on lab when I was there and then focus on desk-related work once a week. Additionally, it gave me freedom to have weekends to spend time with family, friends, and enjoy hobbies to keep myself sane!   However, now that I have started my postdoc, this schedule seems to be viewed as lazy and not putting enough work in. My new advisor is younger and more hands-on, but before joining the lab, I clarified that her metric for evaluation was on project progress rather than hours worked. My question is whether you think working this schedule is unreasonable or not enough for a postdoc. My standpoint is that if I can complete the work necessary to move my projects forward at a reasonable pace, then the hours worked in lab is irrelevant. However, I also understand that for many labs, the culture for postdocs is to have a very high output that necessitates longer hours in lab.  For context, I am a chemist with plans on going into industry after my postdoc.  Thanks for your input!", "completion": "One thing that you didn't mention, but that might be important, is the supervisory capacity of your new role as a postdoc.  Does your new PI have other postdocs? Does she have undergraduate or masters students who shouldn't be lone working in the lab? Is there a health and safety aspect to your presence that you've discounted? Does your new role include a large degree of technique transfer to junior lab members?  With what you've posted here, I don't have the information to say whose expectations are off-base. That said, I'm struck that, when you listed your outputs, none of them involved the lab as a whole, only you, your hours and your projects. A lot of PIs never set foot in the lab before COVID (and far more these days), which necessitates Mon-Fri coverage by the postdocs for basic supervision of junior staff - regardless of how productive you are in your chosen hours - and that's a large and often missed component when making the shift from PhD to postdoc."}
{"prompt": "Young grad kid at work told me to change my dimensions...was I wrong for saying no? I recently was hired as an engineer at a defense manufacturing company in new jersey along with a couple of other younger folks.  I am \"non degreed\" and got my training via my uncle who is a well regarded PE, along with the work force since the age of 18 (I am in my 30s now)  , the other guys are degreed.  One in particular graduating from a top 10 school in california.  &#x200B;  Anyway I was recently put on a project and partnered with one of the younger kids. It is his first job out of school fyi. We basically did some parts of a project separately and then combined our detail sheets at the end.    &#x200B;  He opened mine up and said \"ok change yours and make it look like mine\". In a rather sort of disregarding way.   &#x200B;  I spent a great deal of time on my drawings as there is a lot going on and I tried to make it as clean as possible. I avoided redundancy, called out items once with a \"typ.\" note if they are called multiple times within the drawing etc.   &#x200B;  I also recently funny enough posted on here about how exactly holes and cuts should be shown correctly within a drawing.   I was told by some folks that my holes should be dimensioned in relation to each other if they are paired or mated with holes on other parts. Prior to this I was basically calling out my holes and showing each one from the edge of the sheet metal/material.  I came to learn that this was incorrect or maybe not the best since I was not highlighting the critical dimensions, which is the spacing between the holes or cuts, since this is specifically related to the function of the part and how it is mated or constrained to other parts within the assembly or overall product.    &#x200B;  However the coworker I was partnered with wanted me to change my dimensions to his format, which were all shown with their location relative to the 0 point. In an ordinate style.  &#x200B;  I decided to look thru my companies prior drawings and saw that others as well as the top engineer in the company over the past 10 years...all make their dimensioning similar to mine. Simplifying duplicate dimension, avoiding redundancy, and calling out dimensions that are specifically related to the function of the part.  &#x200B;  I kind of was upset because I felt this kid thought he was right by default since he graduated from this awesome school...and automatically wanted me to change mine to his.  Btw he also had a bunch of lines intersecting and his sheet was pretty messy.   &#x200B;  &#x200B;  But maybe I am missing something?  Anyway, am I correct in how I am   dimensioning and thinking of my detail sheets or am I wrong?  &#x200B;  I kind of felt offended to be honest and I guess I am insecure since I am the only guy without a degree...  &#x200B;  I told him I wont be changing it and told him why. I then told him he could change his to match mine but its probably not a big deal...  &#x200B;  Thanks", "completion": "Naw. Both ways of dimensioning are legitimate ways of dimensioning. Ordinate dimensioning I find is easy for machinists and relatively simple parts that you set up in a mill or lathe etc. Relation dimensioning can become messy but it's good for QC drawings and more complex parts. While the other engineer sounds a bit less team oriented I always like to dig into why someone does something a certain way. You can learn from anyone regardless their age or experience! I will also say if your company has a standard that should always be followed! (Unless you want to take up the task of changing their standard!) And also on the fact of not having any engineering schooling... that should not matter in this scenario as long as you are good at what you do"}

Not every school has advanced classes either and I know my hs only had 3 AP classes. I think that schools should place students in classes based on their ability level. Instead of having someone fail a class, they can take a lower level class so they are actually learning and have a better change of comprehending what's going on. The students that are exceeding may be put in higher classes so they don't become bored with the curriculum.   I don't mean that students should be put in different grades.

{"prompt": "Help me make better fusion dumplings I've made dumplings following this recipe from Serious Eats several times. They turn out pretty well flavor wise, but I am unsatisfied with how the filling seems to turn into a bit of a puck inside the wrapper during cooking. When eating the dumpling in two bites, there's a decent chance the other half of the filling might fall out of the dumpling between bites.  &#x200B;  I made them last year for a large family gathering (a very long afternoon of wrapping beforehand). They liked them a lot, and have requested I make them again. Obviously I could make the same thing and it would be a people pleaser, but I'm unsatisfied with making EXACTLY the same thing because it didn't meet my expectations. I have done a few test batches with different types of filling to see if I can get a better texture and different flavors, and I hope that you all can help me refine these to make something I really enjoy.   &#x200B;  My real goal is to make tasty smoked pork dumplings with an Asian flavor, thus the 'fusion' in my title. On try number one, I smoked a pork butt with a traditional BBQ rub containing sugar. The pork was good, very smoky with a sweet and savory bark. I mixed it with typical Asian flavors (garlic, ginger, scallion) plus a little Memphis BBQ sauce and gochujang as something to bind the meat and veggies. It was ok, but very strong on the BBQ sauce. The gochujang provided a nice spicy kick behind the sweet BBQ sauce but in general I felt that it was too sweet. Texture was more like what I wanted - because the meat was already cooked it did not clump as it cooked.   &#x200B;  My second attempt was yesterday, and I tried to build on what I learned above. Here's what I used in the filling:  * Smoked pork that had been rubbed in salt and gochujang pre-smoke, chopped to 1/4\" peices * Shredded napa cabbage, about 1/2 the weight of the pork. * Garlic * Scallions * Ginger * The accumulated juices from the pork from cooking/resting. Thanks Chef John! I wanted to make sure some of the fat that had rendered off got back in since I removed most of the solid pork fat pre-shred.  Served with a dipping sauce of rice wine vinegar and soy sauce.  &#x200B;  I really liked it - it no longer had the loud sweet note from the BBQ sauce and the filling texture was loose, but not *too* loose. The vinegar dip really completes it for me, cutting through the heavier pork flavor. I would have appreciated a little more \"Asian\" flavor here, which is surprising because I was almost sure I overdid the garlic/ginger/scallions. The smoke was also really prominent. I actually liked that but my wife did not - she said it tasted like a smoked pork dumpling. To me, that's her agreeing that it needs more zing. Here's a couple ideas I had on what to try next, I'd love any comments on those or suggestions on how to to get better.  * Less smoke during the pork's cooking time - I smoked with apple chunks over charcoal and kept the smoke going for the first three hours of the 8 hour cook. I could just go with one hour to cut the smokiness in the final product and let the other flavors shine through. * Use more cabbage - in the serious eats recipe, Kenji uses equal weights cabbage and meat. More cabbage filler means less meat per dumpling means less prominent smokiness and more other flavor, right? * Cook the garlic/ginger before adding - maybe a really fast saute in sesame oil to bring out a little more flavor? The infused oil may also help. * Add some liquid to the filling, like straight gochujang, rice wine vinegar, or Korean BBQ sauce?  Thanks everyone! Also if you have a solution to the initial filling-puck issue that would be greatly appreciated as well.", "completion": "Good job adjusting your recipe!   I remember the big differences that affected texture of dumplings between wontons and my mom's Korean *mandoo* were the use of  napa cabbage, firm tofu (squeezed out) and corn starch to hold moisture.  Also - clear potato starch noodles, soaked/boiled, then chopped up finely add a bit of texture and softness.    If you want the texture to be less \"puck,\" consider adding some firm tofu - even better, smoke the tofu along with the pork.    For more zing, replace part of the cabbage with kimchi or saurkraut, the sharper/sourer the better.  That lets you keep the ratio of veggie:meat the same, but adds more acidic bang for your buck to cut the smokiness.   I recommend against adding the juices from the pork into the dumplings - you don't want too much water in them, and it homogenizes the flavor too much. You want there to be contrast within each dumpling - a microcosm of smokey pork, sour cabbage, fragrant ginger and garlic.  Don't put more sesame oil in the dumplings, maybe use some ground sesame seed instead. And don't add sauces into the dumplings unless you are making mega-huge dumplings that are nearly a meal in themselves.    Instead, use those juices as the base for a dipping sauce, with sesame oil, chili, acid (vinegar probably), and a splash of something fruity to complement the smokey pork. Gochujang could go here too.  Dumplings are all about pairing with a good dipping sauce that brings contrast."}

{"prompt": "Black Lives Matter **Black lives matter.** The moderation team at AskScience wants to express our outrage and sadness at the systemic racism and disproportionate violence experienced by the black community. This has gone on for too long, and it's time for lasting change.   When 1 out of every 1,000 black men and boys in the United States can expect to be killed by the police, police violence is a public health crisis. Black men are about 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police than white men. In 2019, 1,099 people were killed by police in the US; 24% of those were black, even though only 13% of the population is black.  When black Americans make up a disproportionate number of COVID-19 deaths, healthcare disparity is another public health crisis. In Michigan, black people make up 14% of the population and 40% of COVID-19 deaths. In Louisiana, black people are 33% of the population but account for 70% of COVID-19 deaths. Black Americans are more likely to work in essential jobs, with 38% of black workers employed in these industries compared with 29% of white workers. They are less likely to have access to health insurance and more likely to lack continuity in medical care.  These disparities, these crises, are not coincidental. They are the result of systemic racism, economic inequality, and oppression.   Change requires us to look inward, too. For over a decade, AskScience has been a forum where redditors can discuss scientific topics with scientists. Our panel includes hundreds of STEM professionals who volunteer their time, and we are proud to be an interface between scientists and non-scientists. We are fully committed to making science more accessible, and we hope it inspires people to consider careers in STEM.   However, we must acknowledge that STEM suffers from a marked lack of diversity. In the US, black workers comprise 11% of the US workforce, but hold just 7% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. Only 4% of medical doctors are black. Hispanic workers make up 16% of the US workforce, 6% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher, and 4.4% of medical doctors. Women make up 47% of the US workforce but 41% of STEM professionals with professional or doctoral degrees. And while we know around 3.5% of the US workforce identifies as LGBTQ+, their representation in STEM fields is largely unknown.  These numbers become even more dismal in certain disciplines. For example, as of 2019, less than 4% of tenured or tenure-track geoscience positions are held by people of color, and fewer than 100 black women in the US have received PhDs in physics.  This lack of diversity is unacceptable and actively harmful, both to people who are not afforded opportunities they deserve and to the STEM community as a whole. We cannot truly say we have cultivated the best and brightest in our respective fields when we are missing the voices of talented, brilliant people who are held back by widespread racism, sexism, and homophobia.  It is up to us to confront these systemic injustices directly. We must all stand together against police violence, racism, and economic, social, and environmental inequality. STEM professional need to make sure underrepresented voices are heard, to listen, and to offer support. We must be the change.   -----  **Sources:**  - https://www.pnas.org/content/116/34/16793 - https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/ - https://labblog.uofmhealth.org/rounds/racial-disparities-time-of-covid-19 - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK24693/ - https://www.joincampaignzero.org/research - https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/black-workers-coronavirus-covid-19 - https://www.npr.org/transcripts/867466515 - https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/01/09/diversity-in-the-stem-workforce-varies-widely-across-jobs/ - https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0519-z - https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.6.3.20190529a/full/ - https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2018/09/11/even-progressive-academics-can-be-racist-ive-experienced-it-firsthand/ - http://www.bu.edu/articles/2017/lgbt-issues-stem-diversity/", "completion": "Not sure i agree with this paragraph.   *However, we must acknowledge that STEM suffers from a marked lack of  diversity.

Having 7% working in STEM jobs seems about accurate considering they only make up for 11% of working population. Also wouldn't this bring more attention to hispanic workers? they make up for 16% of the working population yet only have 6% of STEM jobs.

According to this site:  https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=4&lvlid=25  non-hispanic blacks are 1.3 times more likely to be obese compared to whites and they are 20% less likely to partake in physical activity. Also 4/5 african american women are overweight/obese and are 50% more likely to be obese compare to non-hispanic white population. Couldn't the percentage of COVID-19 deaths be more attributed health conditions which i can't see how that would correlate to systemic racism, economic inequality, and oppression. Also in that same paragraph you mention that black Americans are more likely to work in essential jobs which could essentially contribute to that 40% death rate aswell? It just seems that these statistics are just being thrown around and drawing conclusions without explaining possibilities to why these statistics are so high IMO. I don't know the credibility of the link i provided as i do not live in the U.S.A so they could be wrong statistics so i welcome you to explain the situation better."}

But I\u2019m struggling to understand why it\u2019s favoured over chilli in other dried forms like flakes or powder, which (I think) incorporate throughout the whole dish a lot better.

Honestly, after doing it a few times I'm of the opinion that chili powder only exists to find a less effortful way to get a similar effect as using the whole things, and it works but at the cost of being less delicious also.  To properly cook with whole dried chilis you toast them, soak them in very hot water for a while, blend them to a puree with some of the soaking water, and then pass the resulting goop through a sieve, resulting in a thick rich chili liquid. 100x better than a scoop of dried powdered chilis."}

Here are a few questions that I have been searching online for quite a while without receiving a definitive and trustworthy answer:  1.

If I do have sex in the future, should I inform future partners of the possibility that I have been exposed to a high risk strain?

Thank you so much in advance for taking the time to read all of this and answer my questions.", "completion": "I am dying from cervical cancer as well. I am sorry for your loss. I am not a doctor. I studied biology and when I was diagnosed, spent a great deal of time and effort investigating the disease and associated topics. I try not to give personal opinion and rarely share my own circumstances but thought it was appropriate here.  One of the most common misconceptions about HPV is that once you are exposed and had an infection, you're contagious forever. This is not true. I've put together a couple of links and some laymen's explanation     >Disease Description >Most HPV infections are transient and asymptomatic, causing no symptoms. **More than 90% of new HPV infections, including those caused by high-risk HPV types, clear or become undetectable within 2 years, and clearance usually occurs in the first 6 months after infection**.Persistent infection with high-risk HPV is the most important risk factor for HPV-related diseases including cancer precursors and invasive cervical cancer.  ~CDC  ...  >What can be said with certainty is that the most sensitive tests available--tests that detect HPV DNA in genital tissues--become negative within 6-12 months in over 90% of infected persons. We also know that once the test becomes negative, the person is immune to catching the same HPV type again, which is further evidenced that the infection was truly eradicated by the immune system. However, it remains possible that HPV DNA (or maybe even intact virus particles) persists in small amounts, too small for detection by the available tests. Whether this happens at all, or in what proportion of infected persons, cannot be known with certainty with available technology. But if infection persists, it almost certainly is in amounts to small to [sic] be transmitted to another person and probably will never re-grow to cause warts or precancerous growth. But in most persons the most infections are controlled by the immune system and most experts believe they are truly cured. For \"quick and dirty\" responses by clinicians like me, the evidence is good enough to say \"cure\" and to reassure our patients accordingly.  ~Dr. Hunter Handsfield  It is unlikely that you would still be infected with whichever HR HPV resulted in your wife's cervical cancer. More than 80% of sexually active Americans will have at least one HPV infection and just under 50% have an active infection at any given time.. It is very, very, very common.  That 10% of people who do not clear the infection are mostly people like your wife and I, struggling to fend off cancer or fighting invasive cancer - not people who wander through life not realizing that they carry the virus. That's because the virus negatively affects women at a rate 8 or 9 times higher than men and in countries where women have access to health care, Pap smears detect persistent infections in women.   It takes an average of 7 to 15 years to develop cervical cancer from a HR HPV infection. Current gynecological guidelines]( https://www.acog.org/Patients/FAQs/Abnormal-Cervical-Cancer-Screening-Test-Results) recommend Pap smears every three years for women under 30 (5 years for women 30+). Feasibly, it only takes one missed Pap to get a woman into trouble.  As for your direct risk of cancer, your risk is statistically much lower than the average woman. [HPV causes about 40,000 cancers per year in the US. 16,500 of those are in men and most of those are oropharyngeal cancers (back of tongue and throat). Penile cancer is actually rare.  HPV 16 and 18 are the most frequent culprits of HPV related cancers and are responsible for about 95% of all oropharyngeal cancers. If your wife had one of these, you have some risk (related to oral sex). The risk of these types of HPV have more to do with the individual than they do with the type of HPV though. Consider how many people are infected vs. the prevalence of HPV related cancers.  Learn the risk factors and be sure to stay up to date with your dentist and doctor visits in case you too are among that 10% of persistent HPV infections (unlikely though it may be).  The vaccine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration through the age of 26. Getting the vaccine after the age of 26 is what is known as prescribing \"off label\" and usually just means that your health insurance company will refuse coverage and you'll have to pay out of pocket.  If you get the vaccine before you turn 26, the vaccine is actually free if you have insurance of any kind. This was part of the mandate of the Affordable Care Act. Vaccines  are part of minimum required coverage and covered in full without copay or deductible.  You may have strong feelings regarding protecting future partners considering your very sad history. I will still tell you about the vaccine's benefit to you directly. They would be significantly lower than they would be for your female partners. Men have particular risk from just two types of HPV and you've probably had one already and are now immune. That would leave one other oncogenic type and the two that cause 90% of genital warts that you would be benefitting from in regard to the vaccine. You may have been exposed to those as well and never knew.  Vaccine coverage in the US is actually unreliable and has a lot to do with politics/ideology of each state.  You can't count on your partners being vaccinated. ~~I think I noticed as I read through the comments here that you were not aware a vaccine existed. That is not uncommon, particularly in men.~~   An alternative is to prolong non-sexual, monogomous relationships for about 6 months and use condoms for a while afterward. This allows you and your prospective partner to clear or address any STIs. The longer you are together and sexless, the safer it will be. That's just math. Condoms aren't a great barrier in regard to HPV (and HSV), but they do help.  Of course, the decision is yours.   I hope you have many joyful days and years ahead."}

Take your runny dulce de leche and put it in a pan over medium heat. Let it boil and keep stirring all the time so it doesn't stick to the bottom.

{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old: why are some peppers so hot that they require people to use gloves when handling/eating/cooking with them, yet those same peppers are safe for us to eat?", "completion": "The science behind hotness of peppers is actually really interesting. Capsaicin, the active 'hot' ingredient in peppers activates the channels on our tissues which signal heat (as in fire). Capsaicin literally sends your brain a signal of burning! This can happen to your tongue, skin, and eyes because we have these heat sensing channels pretty much on every tissue which comes in contact with the environment.  It's worth mentioning that theoretically capsaicin doesn't cause permanent long term damage, but may cause extreme discomfort, however there HAVE been some anacdotal cases of permanent damage caused to people that did stupid things (like eating a raw whole pepper with over a million scoville for a bet).  EDIT: I noticed I didn't answer the original question entirely. Capsaicin and chili peppers are safe to eat because while they activate the heat channel, that's all they do. They don't actually burn us, just send the brain a signal of heat.  Source: Biochemistry Masters student studying taste mechanisms (although hot is NOT a taste!)."}

A few days before quarantine began, I decided to sort of  experiment a bit with my sexuality instead of just being bi curious, and hooked up with a guy on grindr. I was really nervous and we decided to just go slow with him giving me oral. I asked him several times before we got together whether he was STD free and he told me yes multiple times,. I even went as far as to use a condom since I was still very scared.   Fast forward into full blown quarantine and the guy texted me, saying that he was sorry he lied and that he should have told me the truth. My heart sunk to my stomach when he told me he had HIV and I instantly blocked him before he could say anything else. Now it's been a few months and I've been ridden with anxiety about my health and what will happen to me. I've been looking online about HIV transmission and all the websites said I should be fine but I'm still very scared because apparently you can still get it from oral if the condom breaks(he also sort of licked my balls a bit and idk if that's a risk factor) and all of this was so new to me. Ive basically cried my eyes out and been stuck in a huge depression. I have no one to even talk to because all my friends and family are a bit close minded and this whole situation is just embarrassing.

{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old: Why does background noise seem to calm some people? For example keeping the tv on when not even watching it when trying to sleep.", "completion": "While white noise is indeed monotonous and can mask out other noise, the sound of TV is quite different. There can be music, talking, silence, sudden changes in rhythm, or anything really.  I've found that there are certain people who particularly require the sound of TV or the sound of traffic to fall asleep, and other types of sound, like white noise, won't do it for them. It's not just any kind of noise that some people need, but very particular kinds of sound.  My theory is that those who need TV to fall asleep may have grown up in homes where parents would watch TV late into the night while the child slept. So they came to associate the sound of TV with the comfort of being home and their parents being around as a source of comfort. To them, silence would mean that no one is home or that the parents are sleeping - leaving them vulnerable and unprotected against whatever a child may be afraid of. Then this gets carried over into adulthood."}
{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old: Why does the same water feel a different temperature to your body than it does to your head? For example when in the shower?", "completion": "What you feel is not the temperature itself, but how fast heat is transferred in (hot) to your body or out (cold) of your body.  Look around you and find some wood (or a book) or glass (table top of drinking glass), or maybe something metallic. Since they're in the room, all 3 of those are at \"room temperature\", but if you put your hand on them, they will feel different \"temperatures\". Metal will seem colder because it's able to remove head faster from your hand (heat conducts faster in metals, so as the heat leaves your hand, goes into the metal, and conducts away, to make room for more heat to leave your hand, so you feel colder).  Wood will probably feel the \"warmest\" since it doesn't remove heat from your hand that fast (insulator).  The same happens on different parts of your body. The skin has different layers and depending on which part of the body you look at, it'll have different size of the fat layer which acts as an insulator of sorts. The more fat there is, the longer it'll take the neurons to feel like heat is leaving the body. Head/Forehead has less fat, so if the hot water is hitting it, heat will go in and the neurons will know right away and tell you it's hot. The same water hitting the body might dissipate some of the heat into the fat layer before hitting the neurons.  There's also the whole notion about wet-bulb temperature which is what you actually feel and can be colder than the actual temperature. (for example, you're in a pool, at a certain temperature, and leave, and immediately start shivering even though room temperature isn't that cold. You're feeling the wet-bulb temperature.)  This might be more than a ELI\"5\", but i can try to answer more questions in further comments!"}

His wife, a full professor in the same department, makes $186,000/yr.  Is this large discrepancy between full professors and chairs common?", "completion": "Okay, throwaway here because this is illegal as fuck.  I work for a very big university in a large college (Like, I believe 40% or so of the grants that come to the university go through this college). Part of my job is direct a percentage of money from all of a professor's projects to his personal account, and another part of my job is to be aware of all the department's accounts which actually pay the professor's their salary. So I can share some of the things I've noticed:  1. $330,000 is a lot. Like, a lot a lot. That's in salary **alone**? Yeah, the highest paid I've seen are department chairs in huge departments like Physics or Biology, and they only make ~$183,000 for 9 months so their 12 month salary if they work full time in the summer is $244,000, and that's a single professor at my institution. Most tenured professors make anywhere from $77,000 to $113,000 9-month salary here, and a vast majority of them don't work in the summer (Just do research, they say).   2. Colleges rob you blind with their overhead costs. I won't give exact percentages for extreme fear of getting caught, but at my institution, the money that you get from a grant goes about half to the college, a quarter to the department, and a quarter to you.  3. That quarter to you isn't nothing, though-- I've dealt with grants as low as $1,000, and as high as $13,000,000. However, the high-dollar ones generally come with huge stipulations on where you can spend the money. As an example, one might say \"$2,500,000 of it must go to buying this piece of equipment (and it might have stipulations that the college has to fund x% of it, the professor y%, the department z%, et cetera), it might say you have to support 18 grad students for 2 years, and give you a small portion for personal salary. They are generally really strict, and even the tiny $1000 ones have regulations.  Sorry, I kind of got off topic. But, tl;dr, discrepancies between chairs and non-chairs are common but that amount is rather outlandish, from my perspective."}

Due to a host of factors (historical, legal, biological, sociological, psychological, and probably a dozen or so more -als) cultures are distinct. And that's a good thing. There are a host of fundamental differences in not only world cultures, but cultures within a country. If you travel between NYC and Texas, you will be convinced you've ended up in a foreign nation. Hell, if you travel from the Bronx to Brooklyn you'll get the same effect.  Race and gender are just obvious because... well, they're obvious. You can see them (for the most part) without having to do anything. You could divide people up by social class, or interest (get a group of football fans and a group of visual novel enthusiasts together and see what happens), or age. These are all cultures! There's all kinds of differences between people, and we should celebrate those differences, they make life so much more interesting!  However, because cultures are different, some have become more powerful than others. This isn't a difference between capability, mind you, it's more frequently a difference in circumstance. If you need a primer on how that happened, I can give it, but I'll skip it for now.  These differences mean that, now, there are some pretty major disparities. My great-grandparents owned some banks in the American South a little over 100 years ago, so my grandfather was fairly well off. This allowed my family a fair amount of leeway in terms of risks in how they lived, because there was a safety net to fall back on. Black people couldn't own a business at that point in many parts of the U.S. So that should give a pretty decent idea of just one reason discrepancies popped up. So now we have to account for those discrepancies in terms of trying to correct those past mistakes, and help along anyone who has fallen behind.  So those are the two main points. Differences are fun, so we should celebrate them, and not just between gender and race, and in order to have equality, we first have to help people to be equal."}

{"prompt": "How to reduce sugar in cookies without ruining taste & texture? So I have a few cookie recipes that are a bit sweet and I want to reduce the sugar but am worried about the ratio of dry ingredients to wet. I don\u2019t want to change too much in the recipe in fear of changing the flavor.  How much sugar can I reduce without affecting the cookie? Or are there any tips or substitutes for making it a little less sweet?", "completion": "Can\u2019t remember where I\u2019ve read it, so please feel free to correct me if I\u2019m wrong. But you should be able to reduce the sugar 1/3 before it affects the recipe. I typically take out 1/4 of a recipe because so many taste too sweet to me. But once you start baking more it\u2019s easier to recognize recipes that have too much. For cookies, for 1 1/2 cups of flour I don\u2019t like to use more than 3/4 cups sugar."}

How would that mean that he is just friends with her just to get into her pants when he still wants to be friends with her after he gets rejected. I\u2019m aware that not all guys act like this after getting rejected. However asking out a female friend is normal and in my experience how most relationships form.

{"prompt": "How do colorblind people perceive lasers at the wavelengths they cannot see?", "completion": "the common forms of colorblindness (*protanopia* and *deuteranopia*) don't really reduce the range of visible wavelengths (at least, not significantly), they just reduce the discriminability of wavelength patterns. the 'missing' cone pigments (so-called Long and Medium pigments for protanopia/deuteranopia, respectively) are so similar that they mostly overlap in their spectral sensitivities.  a protanope might report more difficulty seeing pure very-long-wavelength light, like a red LED or laser light. but they should be able to see it if it's strong enough.  a rare form of colorblindness is *tritanopia* (lack of short-wavelength pigment), in that case short-wavelength light will be relatively invisible, so the visible spectrum really is significantly reduced (the short-\u03bb pigment covers a really different range to the L/R pigments). but tritanopia is not what we typically refer to when we say 'colorblind'."}

I promptly pulled it off the heat and then wondered how I learned to do things this way as opposed to reducing the sauce further *after* adding the cream.

{"prompt": "Help me make better fusion dumplings I've made dumplings following this recipe from Serious Eats several times. They turn out pretty well flavor wise, but I am unsatisfied with how the filling seems to turn into a bit of a puck inside the wrapper during cooking. When eating the dumpling in two bites, there's a decent chance the other half of the filling might fall out of the dumpling between bites.  &#x200B;  I made them last year for a large family gathering (a very long afternoon of wrapping beforehand). They liked them a lot, and have requested I make them again. Obviously I could make the same thing and it would be a people pleaser, but I'm unsatisfied with making EXACTLY the same thing because it didn't meet my expectations. I have done a few test batches with different types of filling to see if I can get a better texture and different flavors, and I hope that you all can help me refine these to make something I really enjoy.   &#x200B;  My real goal is to make tasty smoked pork dumplings with an Asian flavor, thus the 'fusion' in my title. On try number one, I smoked a pork butt with a traditional BBQ rub containing sugar. The pork was good, very smoky with a sweet and savory bark. I mixed it with typical Asian flavors (garlic, ginger, scallion) plus a little Memphis BBQ sauce and gochujang as something to bind the meat and veggies. It was ok, but very strong on the BBQ sauce. The gochujang provided a nice spicy kick behind the sweet BBQ sauce but in general I felt that it was too sweet. Texture was more like what I wanted - because the meat was already cooked it did not clump as it cooked.   &#x200B;  My second attempt was yesterday, and I tried to build on what I learned above. Here's what I used in the filling:  * Smoked pork that had been rubbed in salt and gochujang pre-smoke, chopped to 1/4\" peices * Shredded napa cabbage, about 1/2 the weight of the pork. * Garlic * Scallions * Ginger * The accumulated juices from the pork from cooking/resting. Thanks Chef John! I wanted to make sure some of the fat that had rendered off got back in since I removed most of the solid pork fat pre-shred.  Served with a dipping sauce of rice wine vinegar and soy sauce.  &#x200B;  I really liked it - it no longer had the loud sweet note from the BBQ sauce and the filling texture was loose, but not *too* loose. The vinegar dip really completes it for me, cutting through the heavier pork flavor. I would have appreciated a little more \"Asian\" flavor here, which is surprising because I was almost sure I overdid the garlic/ginger/scallions. The smoke was also really prominent. I actually liked that but my wife did not - she said it tasted like a smoked pork dumpling. To me, that's her agreeing that it needs more zing. Here's a couple ideas I had on what to try next, I'd love any comments on those or suggestions on how to to get better.  * Less smoke during the pork's cooking time - I smoked with apple chunks over charcoal and kept the smoke going for the first three hours of the 8 hour cook. I could just go with one hour to cut the smokiness in the final product and let the other flavors shine through. * Use more cabbage - in the serious eats recipe, Kenji uses equal weights cabbage and meat. More cabbage filler means less meat per dumpling means less prominent smokiness and more other flavor, right? * Cook the garlic/ginger before adding - maybe a really fast saute in sesame oil to bring out a little more flavor? The infused oil may also help. * Add some liquid to the filling, like straight gochujang, rice wine vinegar, or Korean BBQ sauce?  Thanks everyone! Also if you have a solution to the initial filling-puck issue that would be greatly appreciated as well.", "completion": "Good job adjusting your recipe!   I remember the big differences that affected texture of dumplings between wontons and my mom's Korean *mandoo* were the use of  napa cabbage, firm tofu (squeezed out) and corn starch to hold moisture.  Also - clear potato starch noodles, soaked/boiled, then chopped up finely add a bit of texture and softness.    If you want the texture to be less \"puck,\" consider adding some firm tofu - even better, smoke the tofu along with the pork.    For more zing, replace part of the cabbage with kimchi or saurkraut, the sharper/sourer the better.  That lets you keep the ratio of veggie:meat the same, but adds more acidic bang for your buck to cut the smokiness.   I recommend against adding the juices from the pork into the dumplings - you don't want too much water in them, and it homogenizes the flavor too much. You want there to be contrast within each dumpling - a microcosm of smokey pork, sour cabbage, fragrant ginger and garlic.  Don't put more sesame oil in the dumplings, maybe use some ground sesame seed instead. And don't add sauces into the dumplings unless you are making mega-huge dumplings that are nearly a meal in themselves.    Instead, use those juices as the base for a dipping sauce, with sesame oil, chili, acid (vinegar probably), and a splash of something fruity to complement the smokey pork. Gochujang could go here too.  Dumplings are all about pairing with a good dipping sauce that brings contrast."}

What's open to me using a Chinese kitchen and Chinese ingredients? I'd rather stay away from imported goods whenever I can.  They're quite pricey.  **Chinese kitchen**:  - Flames on the stove are crazy hot.  Cooking something like a steak, or even a chicken breast or a pork chop, is quite tough without messing up ('medium-high' to 'high' would be the lowest setting on a Chinese stove, and then there's only one tiny flame in the center).  - No oven.  We have a little toaster oven, which is good for melting cheese and making toast... not much else. Temperature is hard to control, basically impossible to roast stuff.  **Chinese market**:  - In this area of the country (Shenzhen, Guangdong), the quality of beef is pretty terrible unless you're paying a hefty premium.  Lamb is almost non-existent.  Pork and Chicken are cheap and plentiful.  - Seafood is awesome.  Fish are of the regional variety, and there's always tons of crab, shrimp, and crayfish.

{"prompt": "Is a PhD / academia not a good path for a generalist? I tried searching for this kind of advice but didn't find anything so helpful, so I'm posting here.  In my undergrad, I majored in psychology with a good amount of math, computer science, and humanities courses. After a few years traveling and doing non-academic things, I'm now getting my Masters in religious studies, with a focus in East Asian religions, while working in a computational neuroscience lab on the side.  I've loved each of these stages of my life, and think I'm happiest when I have a healthy amount of variety what I get to think about. But I feel like this breadth doesn't lend itself to a career path. On a gut level, academia as a whole still feels like thing that fits my personality and interests the best, but I don't know if my interests are too stubbornly diverse to go into a PhD and potentially academia.  In the course of trying these various disciplines out, I have realized a few things:  * I seem to get tired of one topic or one discipline very easily and really crave novelty / variety. Even though I'm in a religion studies masters, I can only really tolerate taking two religion courses or else I starting getting a little miserable. But a mix of religion, philosophy, psych, and something math-y has been keeping me pretty content. (In the past when I was a math major and then a psych major, I also was pretty unhappy when I was taking only courses in those departments.) * I do have some underlying driving questions. In particular,  my ultimate goal is approximately understanding how humans behave and think and how people's lives can be improved on a psychological level. That's essentially the only reason why I'm doing religious studies right now, in service of that goal. But if I pursued a PhD, it'd almost certainly be something in psychology, probably clinical psychology. I want to be able to think about this question in a rigorous way that it seems like only academics have the freedom to, which makes academia seem like the route I lean toward most. I just wonder if, given my track record of constantly switching from subject to subject, I am a prime candidate to find a PhD project interesting for a year or two and then get really sick of the narrowness and demotivated. I know that this happens to a certain extent to everyone, but it seems like some people are better at pushing through it? And I don't know if I've had that fortitude in the past.  I know it's impossible to tell how any individual will find doing a PhD. I guess I would just like some advice if there are signals that I might be more or less likely than average to make it through a PhD. Are there people in academia who successfully are able to be generalists and draw from many different disciplines and to be thinking in a variety of different ways? Or if you really want to succeed in academia, do you really just have to specialize and only very marginally draw inspiration from side reading (which is not necessarily bad either! Just hard to tell what that will feel like in the concrete).  Anyway, if anyone has any insights, that'd be greatly appreciated! Thanks for reading :)", "completion": "Have you considered being a science/ freelance writer? Many people get their PhDs and then realize they like learning about a lot of different topics instead of hyperfocusing on one. Your PhD can be helpful in getting editors to pay attention to you, especially if you are well versed in writing. It's obviously a very different style of writing, but you have a ton of flexibility and can make pretty good money at it."}

{"prompt": "[Watchmen] When Dr. Manhattan said he would try to create life, I always thought he meant he would try to spark genesis and create simple life - a feat humans have not been able to accomplish scientifically - but later unofficial add-ons to the comic show him effortless creating human life. Can he? So I'm asking from the point of view of the original comic, but looking at the new stuff while understanding it's further interpretations of the original.  But in the original comic, despite being very powerful Dr. Manhattan is still a scientist and spends a lot of his time researching in the lab.  My understanding of his powers is that he can manipulate matter - so very useful in isolating elements like lithium or moving particles around for experiments.  He's helped advance human technology to electric cars and has lead to breakthroughs in physics and understanding of science.  But that does not mean he can effortlessly generate human life from nothing - because if he could, that would be way more advanced than anything like electric car batteries.  Being able to control matter does not mean he could perfectly shape it to create a human being out of nothing, because it is too complex.  That's one of the reasons he is so amazed by Silk Specter - because she's a child born out of incredible circumstances - billion-to-one-type odds, that lead to the creation of her.  My feeling is Dr. Manhattan could not just create something like Silk Specter out of thin air - it's way outside his understanding, if not directly his ability.  That's what makes his arc with SS so compelling.  Dr. Manhattan can walk on the surface of the Sun, but someone like SS is like gold spontaneously turning into air - something totally impossibly unlikely.  But SS is real, and it reconnects him with his humanity and helps save the world (sorta).  So am I right in my thinking, that when Dr. Manhattan talked about creating life he meant trying to generate actual life like here on earth, and then watching it evolve over millennia (since he is also immortal)?  He's not just like BAM create human beings! that's outside the realm of his very incredible powers.", "completion": "He could certainly create a human from atoms.  He's done that with his own body, both reassembling and duplicating himself.  There's no reason to think he couldn't do it with other people.  We don't really know whether he could make a new person, with their own mind, though.  It doesn't really matter, though, because if he wanted to, he could certainly just make the basic building blocks somewhere and just wait for humans to form.  He has all the time in the world, and that project could certainly hold his interest for a long time.  (\"What if I introduce *this* mutation right here?

It is your civic responsibility to vote and it\u2019s a slap in the face considering other countries don\u2019t have the right to vote. It makes non-voters look bad (rightfully) as they are essentially throwing away their vote.  To start off, if you feel you\u2019re too ignorant on certain topics, you can always engage with others them. Research takes time obviously, but you don\u2019t need to be an expert to know whether or not a policy or legislation is good or bad.  To those who believe their vote won\u2019t matter: imagine if 100,000 people thought like you. Would you then say it wouldn\u2019t matter?  To those who believe both candidates are trash, you could be right, but there has to be at least one policy of theirs you would want put into office. There are times where you need to do tactical voting even if you don\u2019t like either party.   You can\u2019t have a perfect politician, so it\u2019s important to choose the one that\u2019s good enough.

While I think this will be the single biggest issue for the state AG in the next term, neither candidate has even acknowledged that it's an issue that needs to be fixed. Neither candidate has put forth a solution. Neither candidate has any background suggesting they'd be better at this issue than the other, or the current AG who let it get so bad, or even just any random person off the street.  I also think that, without intervention, the current state of the child welfare system will allow children to die before people get angry enough to demand that either candidate do a damn thing to fix anything.

{"prompt": "How does our body \"decide\" where to store fat? If we eat more calories than we burn off and are putting on weight is there a typical pattern of where the body will store fat? Sometimes i see some people who are overweight, for example, who have very thin legs. Other times people not that overweight whose legs are larger than you may expect.   Seems the typical areas is around the midriff. For men we all know about getting 'moobs'.   So is there any real order to where fat should be stored around the body?", "completion": "'Fat' is actually triglycerides that are stored inside of 'fat cells' (adipose tissue).  The adipose tissue is found in certain locations around the body (determined by genetics, etc).  When you gain fat, what's actually happening is the fat cells are getting filled up.    You could think of it like having millions of tiny balloons under your skin and around your body.  When the balloons are empty you look skinny.  When they get fuller then you look fat.  But... the balloons are always there.    When you lose weight, you don't actually up whole 'fat cells'.  What happens is that the triglycerides inside your fat cells get mobilized (get broken down into glycerol and free fatty acids) and then pass out through the cell walls into your bloodstream (then get burned, etc.).  In the process the adipose cells shrink because they aren't as full any more.  So, in answer to your question, as I understand it, the reason you get fat in certain areas (belly, hips, moobs, etc.) and not others is simply because your body has adipose tissue in those places and not others.  Your forehead, for example, has relatively few adipose tissue cells... so it can store relatively little fat.  I am sure there are other factors... but I hope this information is helpful.  **tl;dr fat is stored in adipose tissue in the form of triglicertides; genetics drives location and concentration of adipose tissue**"}

Saarinen, Jantunen, and Haahtela  (2011), which silveraw posted, found that birch pollen honey was effective for birch pollen allergy relative to a control group of \"usual allergy treatment\", but no different than regular honey.   I am not expert in this field, but my interpretation is that there is little evidence that local honey is more than a placebo. The effect that Saarinen, Jantunen, and Haahtela  (2011) find could just be a placebo effect since they did nothing to their control group. Giving the control group a dummy treatment of honey flavored corn syrup, like Rajan et al (2002), is a much better experimental design."}

{"prompt": "CMV: The Purpose of a language is to communicate ideas and emotions, thus cursing is the most accurate way of conveying an annoyed or angry state of mind. I have heard a number of times that only people who cant think of something better to say a curse or that only stupid people curse. however, it is my opinion that language has evolved to convey meaning quickly and that when I tell someone to \"F*ck off\" I in very few syllables have told this person that I no longer witch to be in their presence due to some prior problem.  what I have done here is use the English language to convey my emotions and important information in the smallest amount of time.  _____", "completion": "There is a sense of 'crass' that can only be conveyed by cursing, but annoyance and anger aren't necessarily linked to being crass. For example, I can be annoyed that the DMV is slow, but that doesn't make the person working the counter an asshole. Maybe their boss under-scheduled people, maybe there's no room in the budget for more employees, maybe Jimmy went on a bender last night so Sonya is working twice as hard today because he \"called in sick\".   The ugliest dismissals I've ever heard aren't filled with curse words. My two best cultural examples are Don Draper's (sorry in advance about potato quality) I don't think about you at all and Buffy's \"You're beneath me\".   But you're not **entirely wrong**. I was once at a wedding where a couple (not the bride and groom) got in the ugliest fight and the mom put their kid in the middle of it. \"You know daddy love drinking more than he loves you, right baby?\" I mean, nasty shit. My mom and I took one look at one another and, like heat-seaking missiles, descended. I grabbed the kid and took him outside, so I have no idea what my mom said to the couple. Eventually mom came out and left with the kid, dad left later, and my mom and I were also on our way out. And I'll never forget what my mom said to me when I got in the car (I'm maybe ten or eleven when this happened): \"That woman is a cunt\". I never heard my mom use that word before or since, but I'll be damned if she didn't mean it in a very, very serious way. And I knew what she meant in a visceral way, that the woman wasn't a just a bad mom or a bad person, but vile on this whole other level.   **That's what cursing is for**. Cursing is most correctly used when reading for, not anger of annoyance, but something primal and dirty. It's why we use it during sex, it's why we use it when we're contacting our most primitive emotions. It is about going base, reaching back to reptilian parts of ourselves.   **So here the view I want to change**: it isn't that any particular feeling (pleasure, joy, hatred, annoyance, anger, sadness, frustration) is best expressed in curse words. You can get to those feelings a thousand ways. I'd so much rather be told to go fuck myself than have someone look at me and say, \"You're beneath me\". That actually hurts more. We curse when we want to connect to the primal forces of the world. And that's dangerous because it often can say more about you than it does about the person or the situation. So in the DMV example, the person screaming that Sonya is an asshole because he didn't bring the right documents...well...he's kind of the asshole in that situation. Not Sonya. He's given away his primal state more than he's uncovering hers. The person chanting \"Fuck\" under her breath while she paces in the hospital waiting room is telling everything about the rawness she's feeling.   I think that's why we try to teach children not to swear. We don't want to acknowledge that their innocence is tarnished by those raw and primal realities. And, in a lot of ways, they will call their entirely reasonable teacher a bitch and not think twice because maybe they don't really, fully understand the primal realities yet. We don't trust them with the darker shades of the world, though as anyone who once was a kid will remember, you become acquainted with them much earlier than most adults want to acknowledge."}

{"prompt": "Is it possible to 'store' light so it can be used as a form of energy? Year 12 student here. I recently learnt about superconductors and how they can essentially keep current running in a loop forever without losing energy. Random idea just popped into my mind - since we've developed fibre optics - a way of transmitting data by sending light patterns with energy loss close to 0 - why can't we use principles such as TIR (total internal reflection) to collect large amounts of light (sunlight) and then store it similar to how the superconductor bank works?   If we could be able to store light as a form of energy - could be collected, amplified by using mirrors and be a source of sustainable energy much alike solar panels (quite inefficient).   So to all the scientists out there, is this concept plausible? and if it is, what could we do with such a concept?", "completion": "That's what plants do with photosynthesis. They take light, they use its energy to excite electrons in the photosystems (the bits where chlorophyl is) and then they use those electrons to pump protons (H^+ ) through a membrane. The protons then want to move back to the side of the membrane with the least concentration, and they deposit the energy that was transferred to them by the excited electrons, into a protein that acts like a pipe. Then that protein converts the energy into chemical energy (ATP). Throughout this process other chemicals are produced that pass through another big process (Calvin cycle) to produce even more energy stored in glucose (sugar).  There are many projects around that try to take advantage of photosynthesis. The problem is:  a) to create machinery that can convert efficiently the chemical energy we have produced to store energy, into a more usable form of energy, like electricity or heat. Plants (and all other organisms) don't do this very efficiently at all. 70% of that energy is dissipated as heat.  b) To make artificial photosynthesis be fast enough, so that it can create a bulk of solar fuel. To do that we need to make it capture way more energy from sunlight than what plants achieve.  Artificial photosynthesis has been a thing since the very early 20th century (1910-1920), but only recently did we make it industrially feasible by creating artificial leaves that capture 10% of sunlight when using pure CO2 or 3-4% when they use atmospheric CO2. In comparison, plants have a 0.3-0.6% efficiency (When I say efficiency here I mean how much energy from the total sunlight radiation that hits them gets captured to be used in photosynthesis)."}

{"prompt": "What is the difference between a convection oven vs a regular oven? I just moved into a new house, and I have two ovens. One is smaller and just your average regular ol\u2019 oven. The lower oven is larger (normal size) and has two options for control. One of them is \u201cconvect\u201d. I\u2019ve watched enough food network to know that convection ovens are used, I just don\u2019t know why/what for.", "completion": "A convection oven has an internal fan that circulates the air. This keeps the temperature even thru out the oven.  A conventional oven will have natural hotter/colder spots.  The real advantage of the convection oven is the surface area around the food you are cooking. In a conventional oven, the space near the food is cooler (the food will 'cool' the oven heat as the food heats up). The convection fan ensures that hotter air is constantly circulated against the food surface. That is what decreases the cooking time. You will get better browning, and lower cooking times."}

For cookies and muffins, halfing the recipe is very straightforward. For making sponge cakes or tray bakes, you will need to calculate the volume of batter the full recipe makes in relation to the size of the tin you are told to use, and then the volume of a smaller tin portioned tin you want to use and divide the ingredients accordingly, I hope that makes sense! To conclude, today I made cannolis, the recipe said makes approx. 12-15. I used a third of the ingredients and ended up with five, a much more manageable amount imo!"}

{"prompt": "Is it necessary to go to court for legal custody, or should I be fine? [NC] I have 2 daughter's (6 and 7) whose birthdays were in July and September, respectively. I have been in their lives since prenatal appointments. Their mother left me for another man in July 2020. Since she left, her communication with the girls has been very spotty (months in between), and I have been 100% the only provider for them, and they've been in my physical custody.  We saw her in February of last year, and then didn't hear from her until May 12th of the same year. While she was visiting during that day, I was exhausted and passed out from work. When I woke up, she was gone, and had taken the kids. She took them to live in a motel room with her boyfriend (random man to my kids and myself) and his 3 sons, who I believe ages ranged from like 6-12 at the time. She had them from May 13th, until I found her and took them back on August 26th of the same year. During the time she was gone, she wouldn't let me speak to them, and I missed my youngest daughter's birthday for the first time. The 2 times I saw her during that time frame, she tried to blackmail me I to signing joint custody papers.  When. I got my kids back, they told me that their mom and her boyfriend had been spewing venom to them about me, and that the boyfriend would hit them with a belt. When I confronted her via phone, she said \"Don't you think I know that? Why do you think I let you have them?\". October 11th of last year, she texted me saying \"I have to go away for a while\". I didn't hear from her again until January on this year, and she spoke to them on the phone for all of about 5 minutes (If I'm being generous). Since then, we haven't heard from her. No birthday calla, nothing. I keep tabs on her via social media, so I know she is alive and well, and has a car. Her not seeing my kids is 100% her decision.  I originally filed for full custody during the period where she took my kids, but I didn't follow through once I got them back. I still don't want to follow through yet, because I feel like she'd try to contest it just to spite me, and I don't want to wake the sleeping bear.  Is it vital for me to file for custody, or am I fine by letting her go even longer without contact, to ruin her chances in the event she tries anything? I don't talk to my kids about her, as I don't see the point, but they express to me that they don't even so much as want to talk to her on the phone. Even for their birthdays. I also don't plan on ever letting her around them unsupervised, so she can't take them again. What is it looking like for me?", "completion": "u/illustrious_you_2362 you HAVE to get a custody order in place. You say that you would stop her from taking the kids again but you can\u2019t.   You could try physically but then the police would be called, they would either arrest you (which means you will have hours where you can\u2019t get legal proceedings started or have someone find out where she is) or the cops would allow their mother to take them.   It\u2019s not true that men don\u2019t get custody when they pursue it (it\u2019s just that a lot don\u2019t) BUT many law enforcement might just default to allowing a mother to take her daughters, especially at such a young age.   Get it in writing that the bf is abusive. Even if she doesn\u2019t explicitly say \u201che beat them\u201d if YOU say \u201cremember how you brought them back because BF was hitting them with belts?\u201d And she doesn\u2019t refute it, that\u2019s a step in the right direction. Because most people would deny it if it didn\u2019t happen.   Also, filing and going after custody FIRST is a mark in your favor. Especially because you\u2019re a man (again, sad but true, statistically men don\u2019t pursue custody as often as women). Don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking that you\u2019re fine and because they\u2019re with you right now, you have any legal standing.   Under a custody order, what your ex did before (taking them and disappearing) is kidnapping. And the police will find your ex and bring your kids back. With no custody order it\u2019s just a mother taking her children, and there is nothing that police (or you) can do about it, unless she\u2019s breaking the law in some way.   GET A CUSTODY ORDER.   Trust me. NO ONE has ever said \u201cDamn, I really regret the law enforcing my rights as a parent\u201d but there has been thousands upon thousands of parents that have regretted not having a custody arrangement in place.   Don\u2019t be one of the people that regrets it.   Even if you end up with 50/50. It doesn\u2019t sound like your ex is at a very stable or reliable point in her life. Every time she misses a weekend, every promise she breaks, every holiday she skips, it\u2019s a mark in your favor to gaining full custody.   Spend the money now. It may seem like a lot. But it\u2019s a whole lot more hiring private detectives to find your kids and to avoid it in the future, you\u2019ll have to spend the money to get custody anyway."}

However this begs the question if the thermal exhaust port was this purposely planted weakness in the Death Star intended by it's designer to be a kill switch why couldn't even a veteran pilot nail the shot?

{"prompt": "CMV: There are many positives to organized religion, and from my point of view the online left fails to see the benefits of it. How\u2019s it going guys. I\u2019m writing this from a place of good faith, so I would hope you respond as such. I\u2019m not religious, but I\u2019m extremely sympathetic to many religious peoples and groups. I think they are a force for good in America, and in many parts of the world.   I have a few points, just a few.  A: Community Organizing and Involvement B: Charity and Donation C: Common Morality   A: This is my biggest point, and it basically boils down to the idea of a central community building or area which can be shared and used for the will of the people. This has numerous benefits to the people, because the face to face human interaction of people who may disagree over politics, law, and the world can help make the situation much more amicable and respectful. People become less separated from each other because there is always a time of the week where you come together, sing songs, talk about life, and unite around something that are all parts of your life. This space can also be used for things unrelated to the church, such as picnics and clubs.  B: Religious organization all across the world, and specifically in America are some of the biggest givers. They donate in large amounts, to lots of different causes and people groups, no matter the time or situation. These donation aren\u2019t always related to faith either, and can range from helping your local homeless shelter to giving aid to Syrian refugees. This has demonstrably helped many people all over the world, and religious organizations are vital to thousands of non profits all across the globe. This isn\u2019t much of a arguable point, since you\u2019d be hard pressed to find someone who hates charity.   C: This is probably the main point you may disagree with, but I think a common sense of moralities is important for a society to function. Obviously they would have to follow the laws, but having act better because of some eternal force combing us all together is , I think, a good thing.   Common arguments against this are absolutely the bad religion has done before and arguable does today.

I've only seen the church serve to force conformity.       My own grandma got pulled into it, just a few short years ago she was rolling her eyes about how this country called anything that actually helped poor people \"socialism\" and she laughed at an artist that made a nude Trump statue and called Trump an ass and laughed at the idea of him being president. Then as the election heated up and he became a more serious candidate her church started to back him.      Now she's deep down the Trump rabbit hole and suddenly right wing as hell. They never adopted any of her views, they didn't compromise a bit, they just shunned her, and argued against her, and wore her down until she adopted every single one of their views and was in complete lockstep with them. There was no debating or mutual understanding, just the crushing of dissent.       Similar thing with my sister, though she belongs to a different church. Was scared as hell of covid in the beginning, didn't go anywhere without hand sanitizer, and a mask and glasses to protect herself. She's diabetic and has long had health problems, and our mom has an auto immune disease, so she took thus seriously. Then her church started turning against it and now all of a sudden she too thinks masks don't work and are actually poisoning us and the vaccine will kill us, and we're stupid to be afraid of it or take it seriously.

{"prompt": "Let\u2019s say you had a tube that ran from earths surface to the outside of earths atmosphere into space. Would this tube act as a vacuum and try to suck everything up from earth? (Assuming the tube would remain supported and stay in place)", "completion": "Good question, I can see why you would think that.      I think your question is based on a couple of false assumptions though.    1. You seem to imply that there is some kind of barrier or membrane holding the atmosphere in. This isn't the case, I'll explain below.   2. You also seem to imply that there is no gravity outside of the Earths atmosphere. Again, this isn't the case. In fact The International Space Station experiences almost as much pull due to the Earths gravity as we do on the surface. I know this seems weird because we have all seen images of Astronauts floating around etc, but that is caused by it's orbit, not an absence of gravity.     I think a better way to approach this is to ask, what keeps the Earths atmosphere from floating off into space?      The answer is, as it often is, balance of forces.      The reason we have air pressure here at the surface is a combination of the pressure created by the internal temperature of the gas and the weight of all that gas on top of it pressing down. The second point is why pressure drops as you get higher, less weight on top means less pressing down.      So what causes this gas to have weight? The answer is gravity. Like everything else with mass, it is attracted to the Earths mass by gravity. So gravity pulls down on the gas, and it's internal pressure pushes up on it a bit, the balance of forces gives us our pressurised atmosphere.      Now why wouldn't the air in the tube escape to the lower pressure of the vacuum? Well, it kind of does. If you started with a sealed tube containing a vacuum and opened both ends, air would move from the high pressure zone at the bottom to the low pressure zone inside the tube. It would continue to rise until the point where the push from the (ever diminishing) pressure equals the pull due to gravity and it would stop. This would be at exactly the same height as the surrounding atmosphere! (sort of, there isn't a clean line between atmosphere and space like we were taught in school, it's a bit more fuzzy).     Here's an interesting related phenomenon. Have you ever put your finger over a straw and pulled it out of the drink? The liquid stays in the straw because the pressure of the atmosphere pushes down on the surface of the liquid, pushing it up inside the tube. It doesn't fall because the top is sealed and therefore no balancing pressure pushes down.      Now if you had a straw long enough and did this experiment, at some point you would see a bubble form at the top of the liquid. this is not an air bubble however, it is a vacuum bubble! What happens is at a certain height the weight (a force) of all that liquid becomes greater than the force of the atmospheric pressure pushing up  from the bottom. In fact it wouldn't be a true vacuum because some of the liquid would boil off and form a gas, but that's a different story. ;)     Sorry if this answer is a bit long winded and inelegant, I kind of just typed as it came to me. Hope it helps though."}

This is why you see people claiming they are super totally \"not-free\" when they have to press 1 for English or when someone asks them to use the correct pronouns: they typically have no literal have no conception of what being *not free* would entail.   So, what happens when someone deviates from a collective agreement in each of these situations? Well, in the fully libertarian societies, *whether they realize the contradiction or not*, it is often a might makes right approach or full  neglect. When it is neglect (like all of the examples of the most hated man Bob in this case), Bob no longer has the same opportunities as other people, and by construction, for not have the same individual liberties (they are cut off to him by *collective* means).   When you deviate from a collective agreement bound by laws, you do not face immediate ostracization, and can usually still participate in the rest of the society unless due process deems you unfit, and sentences you to jail.   The advantages and disadvantages of each are pretty clear, I think.   I would encourage you to think of these things not as \"society should be either collectivist or individualistic\", but to think about what benefits a collectivist society, in some regards, can benefit it's participants with only minor sacrifices in individual liberty. On the margin in each case, we usually recognize that there's some give in each direction, and that's what most successful societies have realized."}

{"prompt": "Someone internal at UPS stole $7000 dollars in computer parts, delivered me an empty box, and denied my claim as the box wasn't damaged?  Title.  The Backstory:  I run a community that hosts game servers.  We use the income generated from these servers to pay for the rental on our full rack of owned equipment in a datacenter in Dallas,TX.  We had a technician damage both the motherboard and processor in a botched CPU cooler install (dont ask).   So we pulled the entire server and the technician dropped it off at my partner\u2019s house. My partner (who lives in Texas, I live in Wisconsin) broke down the server and tried to troubleshoot it further. He took a picture of the motherboard, processor, memory and drives. Since it was not fixable, he put it into the box.   **He has a Ring doorbell and a recording of UPS picking up the package that also matches the timestamp recorded on the tracking number. The UPS agent didn\u2019t put the box in the back. He put the box in the front - we have all this on video!** There wasn't any other activity before the box was picked up. It was sent to me via 2nd day air with UPS as the courier.  Fast forward to 4 days later, I get the box delivered to me. I met the driver as soon as he dropped it and the package was outside for not even 30 seconds.  Upon picking up the box I realized something was very wrong as it felt extremely light.  **I have a video of me opening the package from start to finish.**  The package was completely empty aside from the packing material inside.  Looking over the box, someone cut open the bottom of it, put a single piece of packing tape horizontally across to hold the bottom together.  I immediately inform my partner that someone internal to UPS has stolen the contents of the package.  My partner contacts UPS and explains the situation.  UPS opens a claim as a \u201cdamaged box\u201d as you cant claim anything else conveniently. They then want to schedule a pickup of said box.  They picked up my box yesterday and closed/denied the claim today with the following:  **\u201cMerchandise is missing. UPS will notify the sender with additional details. / All merchandising missing, empty carton was discarded.  UPS will notify the sender with details of the damage.\u201d**  What blows me away is someone internal at UPS KNEW what was in my box and took it all and I\u2019m out my investment and the revenue stream.  At this point I\u2019m at a loss as to what to do next.  Small Claims?  I uploaded all my invoices of the items that were stolen, screencaps from the video of me opening the empty box with the single piece of tape on the bottom but none of it mattered as the box wasn't damaged?  **TLDR; Someone internal at UPS stole the internals to my server and refuses to acknowledge I was delivered an empty box.**", "completion": "This is always a worry when shipping high value packages. For reference, this is why with Registered Mail packages, you cannot have any of the edges showing, and the package is covered in tape and stamped. Thus, it prevents entry and any package that is tampered is refused. Similarly high value packages at UPS must be double boxed as a minimum and not simply be able to be retaped(think the express boxes where opening it ruins the box).   Of course this only helps you in the future. As for your claim, I would expect that UPS won\u2019t do much, especially from their perspective. The only time we have had luck internally was when our driver was caught stealing packages after a series of packages along his route went missing. Insurance itself wouldn\u2019t have been helpful as the question is can they catch him stealing it which is very hard. Better and safer packaging is critical when shipping valuables. The first step would be to request the weights of the package at various centers"}

{"prompt": "What's wrong with my homemade Vanilla Extract? We made some vanilla extract by putting several vanilla beans in very high proof alcohol (70%) in January of 2020. Waited 6 months, shaking the bottle about once a week. Vanilla extract was great.  Just noticed, however, that there are white pieces floating in it? Looks like the beans may be turning white-ish? Is this normal or does it mean the vanilla extract has gone bad? What could we have done to prevent this?   Photo of vanilla extract  Thank you!", "completion": "Almost for sure not mold, your beans would have been noticeably moldy from the start. Mold doesn't grow in 70% ethanol. Apparently moldy beans usually have a much lower vanillin content so you likewise also wouldn't be happy with the flavor. Probably just the plant tissue in the pod breaking apart and potentially the 70% alcohol leaching out some of the color from the pod. Most people that do this at home (myself included) use a 40-50% ABV so might have just had a little more breakdown than we've seen. Weekly shaking would also contribute.      I'd just strain it out.

{"prompt": "What\u2019s the craziest shit that happened to you in academia? (Horror tales only) Hi Reddit, I'm producing an episode on toxicity in academia for a podcast, and I've been making a compilation of the horror stories people have told me they've been through. There are the \"standard\" bully supervisor cases but also things like 100-hour working weeks, women feeling they have to give up motherhood to be successful academics, PIs blocking their post-docs from applying for their own grants and really sabotaging their careers, a case of someone stealing a colleague's work and them accusing THEM of plagiarism, people faking their results because they desperately need to publish to secure grants... Please tell me yours. But I thought I would start by sharing mine (sorry it got long):  I got admitted into a super prestigious uni for my MPhil, of course I was over the moon. I had been doing research before somewhere else and had such a great time there, I loved being in the lab. Well, things were very different in my new place. You would've thought you were walking into a funeral when you walked through those lab doors. No one talked much, no one laughed, no one seemed happy. As a new student I didn't know where to find anything, and the lab technician had quit before I joined, so I went to ask things to the postdoc who was extremely rude and unpleasant from day 1. Me and the other new students felt awful when we had to ask her anything, but we needed some initial guidance to do our work that we weren't getting at all. Another student told me I shouldn't ask questions, \"that's how things were\" \\[red flag\\].  With the supervisor things were fine at the beginning because I just never saw him. I went home for Christmas and when I came back he started weekly meetings saying he was \"extremely worried\" I took that break. He then kept asking if I was sure I had \"what it takes\", constantly questioning my potential. I was lucky my experiments were working at the point and I knew I had pretty good results already despite what he said, otherwise I would have probably given up. He a few times suggested I should probably apply to get a less important sort of degree -what people get when they don't have enough for an MPhil-, or look for funds to change it to a PhD. Actually the MPhil student that started the year before was persuaded by him to change to a PhD because he said she wouldn't have enough to get an MPhil within that timeframe, so that poor woman got stuck 3 more years with the bastard. I was NOT going to fall into that trap, but there was just no way we wouldn't get impostor syndrome around that man.  He told me because I was an MPhil student I didn't have the \"luxury of time\" PhD students had, so I should be the first one in the lab and the last one to leave, and that he would work all weekend as well if he were me. I was thinking errr, surely it's proportionate, or does he want me to get a PhD within my fucking 12 months?! Anyway, I ignored his request because I had a life. My mentor who's a super accomplished researcher told me he would only be in lab from 9 to 5 and always got loads done, so I knew it was about the quality of time, not the quantity. There were experiments that did require me to be in lab for 12 hours, and I often had to go in on Sundays to get my samples ready to go on the Monday, but I find extremely important to have quality time out of the department. In fact the other events, talks and seminars I had access to within the uni were super valuable, and the network I built in my college was what kept me sane.   Every two to three months we were required to give a presentation in our lab meetings. To add some context, everyone was terrified when it was their turn. There was zero encouragement to the people presenting, no smiles, no nods, no claps at the end of the presentations (I had never seen that before). At my friend's lab her supervisor got champagne so everyone cheered the person who presented at the end! Well, not there. When I presented in the journal club the presentation wasn't what he expected, my nerves were high, I was probably rushing through so I was done within 40 minutes instead of the 60 minutes I was supposed to take. He was SHOUTING at me in the end. I can't remember what he said, I was in shock, but I had the feeling he was expecting me to cry and would go on and on verbally abusing me until he got what he wanted. But I didn't cry, I just stared at him super blas\u00e9, because it just felt so surreal what this guy was doing. I did feel embarrassed though cos everyone could probably hear everything outside his office.  It was soon my turn to present again, this time my own work. I prepared super well, the presentation was good, some of my colleagues told me afterwards I had done a pretty good job. My supervisor then comes and says I didn't seem very \"enthusiastic\" about my work, and no positive comments, never. And of course how did he expect anyone to sound enthusiastic in such a toxic environment. The anxiety we all felt before having to give these presentations because we were so scared of his reaction was unbelievable. 100% everyone left that lab mentally scarred.   There was a particular experiment that was quite tricky to get to work. I tried and failed several times and this man kept telling me it was such a simple thing, implying I was just super incompetent not to get it to work, so of course I was also feeling super on the edge about this. But I finally managed to make it to work, on and on, I mastered it. Fast-forward I was in a presentation of a PhD student who had just submitted her thesis, so she had been there for 4 years and she mentioned she NEVER got that method to work. So I started noticing it wasn't as straightforward as he implied. Then a couple of other students in my lab also got stuck with the experiment. What the supervisor made me feel awful about for weeks wasn't that easy and no one else there was getting it to work. He hadn't done bench work for 2 decades, these methods were quite new, and he himself never actually got any of it to work, but he was bullying his students over it.   A second-year PhD student was the only one trying to speak out about it. She told her advisor about all the bullying -advisors are other professors in the department randomly allocated to each student so they have a person to go to who's not their supervisors-. The advisor went straight to our supervisor and told him everything she had said, so the supervisor only made her life there even more difficult (she eventually quit)!!! By the way, our supervisor was the head of the department, we just didn't know where to go, who to complain to. Every Friday we had our weekly meetings, I was constantly dreading it, Fridays became my nightmare. One of those Fridays the abuse was quite unbelievable again, so the following week I tried to record our meeting but then he just acted normal!  It got to a point in August I just couldn't get myself to walk into the lab again, though I had planned to run some final experiments. I just didn't have the strength anymore to see him, so I never went back. I never spoke to him again, I didn't respond to his e-mails. I worked on my dissertation, applied to my degree without his consent, got my viva, I passed. I got my MPhil.   It sounds like a happy ending but it wasn't. I don't think the degree was worth it, I would've been better off in a less prestigious institution that didn't have that toxic environment. It took me months, probably over a year to build back my confidence and recover my mental health, and trust me, confidence is just as important as competence. I completely ruled out a PhD, and I would never ask for his reference anyway which I thought was essential for me to get admitted into one. This has completely put me off academia.   The supervisor is still there, bullying people. He was supposed to retire the year after I left, but I found out he had recruited new PhD students, so I guess he wasn't planning on retiring at least in the next 4 years. Sometimes I google him hoping to see an obituary. So far, no luck.", "completion": "My wife failed her first defense because a committee member didn\u2019t like her statistical analysis.

{"prompt": "CMV: The Body Positivity Movement should be about becoming a healthier and better person, instead it just supports and promotes stagnant acceptance. There are a few points I will make right off the bat:  * It's well known that the body positivity movement is primarily catered to those who are overweight/obese, this specific group and message are what I will be specifically discussing. While this movement does include things like skin conditions, burns, etc. These are not things someone can generally change, and are irrelevant to my argument. * Acceptance of ones weight regardless of the size is one of the founding principles of this movement * I do not believe anyone is morally in the wrong for choosing to LIVE an unhealthy lifestyle themselves. My qualms are with those that PROMOTE an unhealthy lifestyle as healthy to others. * I do not believe it should be anyone's goal to meet any sort of socially constructed beauty standards * I was born in and reside in the U.S. so due to that my examples and beliefs are directed there.  Okay now that those are out of the way I can begin (PLEASE make sure you read everything thoroughly before commenting)  It is my belief that the current body positivity movement is actually more damaging to the health and lifestyles of those in society. The current body positivity movement promotes heavily the acceptance of \"all sizes\" this is directed of course to your weight. This is damaging because it convinces people to simply accept whatever stage they are at in life weight-wise and it promotes stagnation. No matter how tolerant you want to be, it is illogical and unscientific to deny that at some point weight becomes a health factor/problem. This movement is essentially saying that you need to ignore these things and simply accept your weight as \"who you are\" and it claims that trying to lose weight through a better diet, exercise, etc, is only due to a need to fit into these hypothetical socially constructed beauty standards (I say hypothetical because the topic of beauty standards is something that is still debated and i dont want to take away from my point in this post). This brings me to my next point which is that beauty standards are not primarily the reason someone who is overweight is going to want to lose weight; and even if it is there is nothing inherently wrong with someone who wants to look better and feel better about themselves as long as they are doing so in a healthy manner. By healthy manner i mean proper meal plans, exercise, changing bad habits, etc. This movement tries to demonize anyone who is trying to actively change themselves for the better so that those who are in stagnation and just accept where they are at can feel better about themselves.  Now here is my idea of what the body positivity could and should be. I imagine a movement that encourages people to NOT accept where they are and to continuously try to better themselves physically and mentally. In all aspects of life if you stagnate and stop trying to improve you will stop making progress, why should we treat our own bodies any differently? at what point did it become bad to encourage a healthy and active lifestyle? Obesity is a huge problem that has gotten exponentially worse in America which everyone can agree on; and while there are many aspects to this problem i believe that lifestyle choices are THE PRIMARY reason. I think we need a positivity movement that encourages you to live a better and healthier lifestyle! Not to meet some stupid social standards but instead so that as a society we can live healthier and happier lives. The current movement does not encourage this and would rather you resign to whatever current condition your body is in. I think true body positivity is being able to love yourself enough to put in that extra effort to live a happier and healthier life.   This is my view, I am always trying to hear and consider all sides of a discussion so please, try to change my mind!", "completion": "As a fat person, I appreciate your attempt to center around active improvement of self rather than simply 'you are ugly, change!!!'  My perspective with this is that the Body Positive movement, at least in my life around gay men, is focused on the idea that are bodies do not define us and that is fat folks are deserving of care and worth because we are humans.  As a fat person, I try to be healthier. Over the last three years, I've increased my daily step count from 3 to 12k. I measure my calories more. I try to balance my meals. I cut out sugary drinks (except in alcohol). That said, I will never fully dedicate my life to what it would take to lose all of the excess weight, because, well, there are other things in my life. I've spent the last few years becoming a leading expert in my field. I've gone to school, i have started writing, I have developed better relationships with friends. These all take energy and I have decided to prioritize these, rather than doing the focus I would need to shed my fat.  The body positivity movement to me is an acknowledgement that it is okay that all those things were done in a fat body. Does that mean I shouldn't try to be healthier? Of course not. I should always be trying to improve. It set my goal around practices rather than a shape.  I also see it sort of weird that folks always focus on physical improvement. The vast majority of Americans do not engage in any intellectual improvement and there's widescale acceptance of the idea that folks don't read, in many places, active glorification. Yet I never see that get as much attention."}

{"prompt": "CMV: (Ukrainian support) Thoughts and prayers, painting something blue/yellow, changing your Facebook frame to blue and yellow or any other method of showing support for the Ukraine that does not involve money is self-focused and bordering on narcissistic.

No. They wouldn\u2019t.   They\u2019re cutting ties to Russia because they know people support it and they want to ride that wave of support to get recognition and make more money.   It\u2019s less what an individual does and more what can become a chain reaction. A bunch of people do something on social media. It becomes popular so companies ride that popularity. This leads to Russia being squeezed more than just by sanctions and hurts their leadership more.   At an individual level, it\u2019s very insignificant.

{"prompt": "Wife using breast pump at work and coworkers are giving her a hard time - VA My wife and I have a 4 month old. She works at a public high school. Each day she is allotted 2-3 breaks per day to pump. These breaks are at specific times based on her schedule.  Originally, they tried to put her in a bathroom to pump, but she objected. So then they found a break room with running water and a refrigerator and created a makeshift \"room\" using tall filing cabinets. She is fine with this arrangement.   Initially there were times where supervisors are upset with her because she can't cover other teacher's classes due to her pumping schedule. I know this doesn't seem like a big deal, but it stresses her out.  Now there is one particular woman who isn't happy the my wife is pumping in this room. I guess because other people are in there.  This woman started a text chain with everyone in the special education department (wife's department) except my wife. The purpose of this was this lady asking if anyone else had a problem with my wife pumping in that room.   My wife found out about this when a friend of hers told her about the text chain because she didn't want to be talking about her behind her back.   Now this lady has gone to the head of the SpEd department complaining that someone walked in on my wife pumping. This is a straight up lie because it is not possible to see my wife without her seeing you as well or without climbing on top of and across multiple filing cabinets.   This morning this lady came in to the room when my wife was pumping and said \"I thought you weren't allowed to pump in here anymore.\"  My wife informed her that none of the other areas provided to her has reasonable access to refrigeration or running water. One was literally an electrical closet on the other side of the building. Plus no one had told her anything even remotely close to that.  My wife replied that it is not her (wife's) responsibility to find an adequate place to pump. It is the schools responsibility to provide an adequate space.   The lady then told my wife that she would find something else by the end of the day.   This lady's constant harping on this has really stressed out my wife. It is actually affecting her milk supply. She gets less than half the amount when pumping at work than when she pumps at home.   I'm also very frustrated.

{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old: If fat is for energy storage, then why is it so hard to get rid of? Shouldn't it be easy to deplete your fat since its an energy storage? I get so confused because people say for weight loss its actually all about diet not exercise. Wouldn't you want to basically just consistently exercise and deplete your energy (fat storage)?", "completion": "Recently, I was diagnosed with diabetes type 2- insulin resistance- and learned a very interesting thing about how the body stores and uses fat. Specifically in regards to blood sugar.   Basically, your body prioritizes using the blood sugar already in your blood before it uses the body's stored fat. In unmanaged Dt2, one's blood sugar is always high. That sugar is used first, while a great deal of it is stored as fat, because that's what your body does in the presence of elevated blood sugar.   In order to use the stored fat, you have to lower your body's blood sugar level. It has to dip below a certain point before your body begins taking and breaking down stored fat back into blood sugar.   Several problems immediately emerge.  1. The western diet eats 3 times a day, constantly supplying blood sugar into a system overloaded with it. It never breaks down fat because it never needs to: there is *always* a faster, easier supply of blood sugar at hand.   2. Crazy stupid levels of carbohydrates  are everywhere. It's not as simple as just 'avoiding sweets' as I used to believe, Its *all* carbohydrates. Potatoes. Pasta. Bread. Apple juice. Get any carb meter (theres an app for that) and track carbs. Most people have no idea how many grams of carbohydrates they are eating, or what their blood sugar levels actually are. Its is crazy stupid hard to discover, balance and control the amount of carbs in ones diet, most processed foods have added carbs to boost flavor. It impossible to stumble into being on a low carb diet- carb control requires a knowlegable and concerted effort, and most people never bother. Why would you? We're told to count calories, not carbs.   3. Cardio is a pain in the ass. My entire life is spent making things easier for me, not harder. Save energy all day just to burn it for no reason at all? What the fuck is that? But it works. Cardio is king. Cardio, along with any intense exercise, *burns blood sugar*. Fast. Like, really really fast. It's so good at burning sugar it's an emergency control for my diabetic ass should things get too out of whack. It's also why cardio is a key part of any weight loss program.    Cardio isnt just for burning calories- in fact, as far as calorie burners go, it doesn't burn very many. But the fuel for cardio comes from the existing blood sugar first, burning away that energy buffer, and lowering blood sugar enough to start using stored energy. Cardio itself doesnt burn off a lot of fat- the vast majority of your calories are burned just being alive- but it sets up the body for success in terms of using stored fat. The same is true for an 'active' lifestyle. Short bursts (20-45mins) of intense activity thought the day burn off extant blood sugar and encourage the use of bodyfat stores.   When you look at the obesity epidemic through a carb-control lense, there are a lot of factors that instantly stand out. From that perspective in regards to weight loss, a tremendous number of people have been 'set up to fail' their entire lives, and never even know it. Probably never will. Its entrenched. I dont see a near future where that ship gets turned around."}

Lots of businesses within the same industry settle in a geographic concentration. This makes it attractive for startups or venture capitalists to locate themselves there as well.  With much companies on a relatively dense area, it's attractive for people who are searching jobs in this specific field to move there.   These clusters are often connected with universities, service providers, etc. specified on the given industry, which makes business relationships and stuff like that incredibly easier due to regional proximity and some kind of symbiosis between them."}

{"prompt": "I want to get a restraining order against my parents after they have continuously harassed me after moving out at 18. Is there any way I can do that? My family is very abusive and controlling, and because of this I moved out at 18 from Austin, TX to Colorado. I sent an email to my mother telling her my reasons for this and that I am moving out. I did not tell them my location. When they saw the email they contacted local police to file a missing person's report, and I had to call the police station to dismantle it. They also took all my money (4k) from my joint bank account right before it would transfer over to my secure one, essentially making me destitute.  After this I moved to Colorado, and nearly every day my mother would send me emails to my address, telling me that I should come back. After about a month of these emails I sent her another one back telling her to stop contacting me.   After I sent this email my father contacted the Austin police department, trying to file another missing persons report, and when I contacted the new officer to once again dismantle it she said that my dad made it seem I was taken across state lines (kidnapped), and that he would be contacting the FBI.   After that they sued my friend who helped get me to the airport for kidnapping and extortion for the 4k *my family* took from my account. My friend's lawyer asked me to send another email in which I said that they never extorted of kidnapped me, and that I moved out of my own accord, and I did.   Most importantly, last night around 12:00AM when I was walking home from work my father walked behind me for a block, revealed himself, and when I ran he tackled me to the ground and restrained me so I couldn't run. My mom came out of a car and revealed that they had been in town for a week, and had been stalking me for that time to find my address and work. They said they believed I was kidnapped and didn't write the emails I sent, and that's why they came. I was able to get them to leave after promising to get breakfast with them, which I didn't attend. Afterwards I went back to my place of work and called the police to get a ride home, and the police officer told me that there was little to nothing they could do.  I want them gone and to leave me alone. Is there any way to get any criminal charge or restraining order on them in Colorado?", "completion": "1. Set up a new email address you will use from here on out. Obviously don't let anyone with some form of contact with your parents to know this email. 2. Close any accounts that you and either one of your parents are on and then open an account solely in your name. Bank accounts and cell phone would be the main ones I would think but you could have others. As long as their listed on the account they will have control over it. 3.

{"prompt": "How to break up an emulsion? Specifically mayo-based emulsions like ranch? I made some wings with friends the other day and decided to make some homemade ranch using Hidden Valley Buttermilk Ranch Mix, 1 cup of cultured buttermilk, and 1 cup of Kenji's mayo. In hindsight, this was obviously way too much ranch for some wings and now I have a bunch leftover.   I remembered coming across Food52's cream eggs in the past and figured I could do something similar with just ranch and eggs.  I've been letting the ranch heat up in the pan and it does eventually separate, but it does take a while and it seems the buttermilk content can start to burn too if I have the heat on too high.   I was wondering if there was a faster method to get the emulsion to separate. And if separating the emulsion would even be worth it in the first place for this recipe.   If you're curious about the taste, there is a bit of ranch flavor, but overall I think since it's 50% mayo which is mostly oil it definitely won't be as rich as the cream eggs, but it seems to be a decent way to use up an abundance of ranch!  Thank you in advance!", "completion": "This is an interesting idea, but i have to agree with other posters that what you're asking to do isn't really feasible. If you want to add ranch to sunnyside eggs, just heat some butter in the pan first, then crack in your eggs, pour a little ranch on/around the eggs, and finish in the oven to set. It won't be caramelized, but itll be there. Alternatively, just add a dash of ranch to your eggs prior to scrambling them and make a soft scrambled egg.   Otherwise, there are tons of uses for ranch, just dip everything in it til its gone. especially pizza."}

Most people are pro vaccine, but the American political landscape of... well politicizing everything, including vaccines, is detrimental to the world, the internet and just society in general.  No other country that I know of has actually decided this party = pro vaccine and another party = anti vaccine, why does this even fall under those brackets in the states?   In Europe if you see someone without a mask where they are meant to where one, people might disapprove, but they aren't going to get into a shouting match about it.   Currently in /r/news there is a topic about a anti vaccine riot in germany, somehow and for some absolutely insane reason, pro vaccine redditors are trying to justify the fact that a police officer pepper sprayed a 4 year old child who's mother was trying to break through a police line. I saw that and just came to the conclusion, pro vaccine America is just absolutely insane.  Reportedly the women had the child in her arms, but I don't think that excuses the officers actions.   Just to be clear, I am really pro vaccine, but I'm not going to attack people verbally for not holding my beliefs.

This makes your arguement, in and of itself, anti vaccine and divisive.  The vaccines were not politicized by those advocating them. They were politicized by those advocating against them.  Furthermore, there was an _actual_ vaccine mandate for polio (which was a lot more 'forced' and far reaching, than covid vacc). We no longer have polio.  What is wrong with a government backing science? Now what is wrong with a failed candidate backing the opposite?  I doubt I will change any views, since most opinions on this are pre determined. But there are many countries with this same divide. There is propaganda (a digital attack) working tirelessly to push anti vacc narratives, with the intent to destabalize countries.  Australia, Germany, UK... I mean how do you believe the US is the only one divided politically on vaccines?  In Europe, people certainly yell and fight over masks and vaccines.

If two species are competing for the same resources (food, living space, etc). There are ultimately 2 outcomes:  1) One of the creatures gets progressively better than the other, outcompeting them to extinction.   2) Both creatures specialise into different areas, allowing them to live without having to compete against eachother as much, if at all.   A similar situation can be seen in cultures.   War between different groups was common in the Americas, even before European settlement, and understandably so.   If you're a hunter-gatherer society, and your population is growing, you are going to need more land to hunt in, and you hunting there means others can't. (This is a concept known as scarcity)  Since humans are always the most dangerous predator around, and niceties are only afforded when survival isn't an issue, other people are always a significant problem.   Cultures like the Inuit survived because they understood this, and decided that they'd learn to follow the food, wherever it may be.   There was a choice: Either fight others to maintain hunting territory, or go somewhere that no one wanted to hunt in. They chose the latter, and went further North. They learned how to survive up there when others didn't care to try, and they were lucky enough to succeed."}

{"prompt": "(Canada, Ontario) Former high school classmate \"crashed\" in my driveway, is demanding outrageous sums of money for damages. So this happened yesterday afternoon and I think that it has everything to do with the fact that my grandfather is giving me a lot of money. I just need to know how worried I should be about this guys claims and if I really am negligent in anything here. I'll apologize ahead of time for the length of this.   Yesterday afternoon I was at home raking the yard with my girlfriend when we hear a fairly loud crash. I look and see that a car has crashed at the end of my driveway. I tell my girlfriend to call 911, duck inside to grab my  first aid kit and rush out to see if the occupants were okay.  Now I live pretty far out in the country and all the houses are pretty far back from the road. Basically it takes me a bit of time to run to the car (30 seconds or so). As I'm running it doesn't make sense to me how the car crashed. It's like it purposefully ran off the road and I worry that someone had an brain aneurysm or something while driving.   I get there and there are two people in the car. A male driver, and a female passenger in the front. The driver is bleeding from his forehead but conscious and seemingly alert. It looks like he smashed it off the steering wheel since the airbags didn't deploy. The female passenger has a black eye for some reason but seems to be fine otherwise. I open the drivers door and ask them both if they are okay and tell the driver not to move his head in case he has a spinal injury. I probably should of said that to the passenger  too but the blood made me focus entirely on the driver.  As I'm saying this the driver fucking flips on me. He starts going off on how this is all my fault and how my driveway is unsafe and how he is going to sue me for this. The guy is goddamn livid and even though I told him to not move he tries to get out of the car.  Now there is some background I should tell you about my driveway. Where I am there are large drainage ditches dug alongside of the country road (They are about 3 feet deep and 12 feet wide). All the houses have a sort of bridge that you have to cross to get to their driveways. I've always been worried about driving off of it so I always stick neon orange reflective poles on the sides of this little bridge-like thing in autumn so I can tell where the driveway is on really snowy days in winter. There had been 4 up at the time of the crash (2 right by the road, and 2 closer to my house). To make it easier understand I drew it out in paint.  Even though I'm pleading with the guy to not move he removes his seat-belt and gets out of the car. He is calling me every name in the book and going on about how he was trying to turn around and my unsafe driveway caused him to crash. He's going on about how his car doesn't have insurance (which by law you need in Ontario) and how he needs the car for work and how now I need to buy him a new car. This car in question was a rusty old cavalier, probably a 1995.   I'm completely taken aback by this, I went out trying to help someone and now this guy is demanding I pay for everything under the sun. I tell him to calm down and that he really shouldn't move because of the accident. I tell him that we already called 911 and that help was on the way.  \"Did you fucking call the cops!?\" He got red in the face and I thought for sure he was going to attack me. He completely flipped out and pushed me hard a couple times and we started yelling at each other. I didn't touch him at all though.  With all the yelling and him acting aggressively, which involved him stepping up to me and asking me if I want to fight while holding his neck because I assume it hurts I didn't notice the cop coming down the road but he did. He drops down and starts wailing about how much it hurts and how I attacked him for crashing his car. He is begging and pleading for help which the cop hears and takes to mean I had just been attacking him. Blood + guy on the ground crying for help while I'm standing above him doesn't look good for me. My face gets intimate with the gravel and I get cuffed.   Long story short what happened next was the cop is talking to the guy and trying to give first aid. The fire department and an ambulance get there and the female passenger breaks into hysterics about how she was pregnant and my unsafe driveway might have killed her baby. Seriously, she was calm but conscious before more people showed up (though she told the cop later she was unconscious). My girlfriend is freaking out because I'm cuffed. some neighbors come over to say he guy was faking it, and generally there is a lot of yelling. It got pretty confusing but there was one thing I noticed.  The general theme those two were going on about was how it was my driveways fault. Anyone who was there got told about it by either the driver or the passenger.   The guy and the girl get taken to hospital and I narrowly avoid being arrested. Thankfully my neighbors across the street came out when they heard the noise, saw the guy menacing me, and were able to convince the police officers that I never laid a hand on the guy. In fact they made a point of mentioning the guys theatrics and how he was only \"injured\" when he saw the cruiser coming down the road.  Today I get a Facebook message from the guy who was the driver of the car and he is demanding what adds up to millions from me. He goes on about how my property was unsafe and how the accident was entirely my fault because I didn't maintain the property. Seriously, Facebook, no lawyer was involved on his part so far. He also says that if I don't pay up \"there will be consequences\" and then he will sue me into oblivion (Yes, that exact order). His demands are so completely insane that I compiled a list;  - New car of his choice (not replacement, brand new) ($?????) - Pain and suffering ($250,000) - He claims that he is going to miss work and I owe him for that ($1.7 million) - He also says that he can't work anymore because his neck hurts to I'll owe him for that too ($2.5 million) - Emotional trauma ($150,000 each for him and his girlfriend) - Apparently his passenger is his girlfriend and she is pregnant so I owe her a million for her and for the child - $100,000 for \"causing trouble with the cops\"  Here is the thing, I never told him my name. I was cuffed by the cop and he was taken away by ambulance before I identified myself to the police officer. Plus we have 6 mutual friends, all from high school. I sent him the \"I never told you my name\" and he deleted his Facebook or blocked me (I did screenshot the message with his name and his profile before that so it's all there saved).   I asked one of the mutual friends I'm pretty close with about the guy and he said that he was living in another major city about 2 hours away from me and had tried to shake him down for money in the past. Apparently he's been doing that with a few people and is even on disability for an injury at someplace he worked before.   My Lawyer is on vacation until Wednesday so I figured I would get everyone's opinion here. What I want to ask is how at risk am I for being sued? I know he is being insane with his demands and that no judge in his right mind would give him as much as he was asking but from what I've said is my property unsafe? They redid the drainage ditch about 5 years ago (before I moved in) and there isn't a single pothole in my driveway. Did I do anything wrong by trying to help the guy? I opened the door because I wanted to make sure he was still breathing but should I have just waited for the ambulance? He moved himself but I'm worried that he might try to claim I moved him because we were sort of obscured by the ditch.   I also would like to know what recourse I have against this guy. I don't need money but if he has been doing this to people for a while now what information can I give to the police that would help them to charge him? I'm 99% sure that the results of the investigation will clear me but should I try and contact the other people he allegedly did this sort of thing to and let them know about my situation so they could come forward?

{"prompt": "[Harry Potter] Why does Hogwarts still use obsolete Potions textbooks? Libatius Borage's *Advanced Potion-Making* dates at least to the 1940s. Severus Snape got his Hogwarts letter in 1971. By the time he got his copy of the textbook and annotated it as the Half-Blood Prince, it had been in use at Hogwarts for decades. If Snape was able to improve so thoroughly on the methods in the official school textbook, why has it seen no major revisions in generations?", "completion": "*Classical Electrodynamics* by J.D. Jackson was first published in 1962 and has been the standard graduate level electromagnetics textbook ever since, even though everyone hates it.  Its use of unit convention is dated and randomly changes halfway through and the text itself is difficult to read at the best of times.  Yet it is also the only book which covers the breadth of material necessary for a general EM course at an advanced level and has been for decades.  As much as everyone who now tries to teach graduate EM hated their own experience with Jackson they still use the textbook because no better book has hit the market.  For whatever its flaws *Advanced Potion Making* may very well be the best textbook written at its level, and nobody has published a book which corrects those flaws or presents its material in a better way.  There may very well be other books published since then that Slughorn decided weren't as good as Borage's text.  Snape's scribbled notes in the margins may have made minor improvements or helped Harry better understand what the book was saying, but those were simply corrections to Borage's original text and not enough to justify a new textbook.  Maybe if Snape had written his own book he could have pushed Hogwarts to use that instead, but given what a terrible teacher he was it's unlikely any book he published would be an improvement."}

I saw a headline stating people kept a killer whale alive for 8 hours while it was stranded on land until tide came back and allowed it to go back to sea. If they breathe air, why would 8 hours on land require assistance keeping it alive?", "completion": "First, they overheat.  Their bodies are designed to be able to dump heat into the surrounding water, and without that present, they have no way to stay cool.  Then they exhaust themselves trying to breath.  While in water, they don't have to work against gravity to expand their lungs.  On land, a whale is lifting several tons each time the inhale.  Finally, larger whales can crush themselves.

With this, I have 2 female employees, and have recently gotten many complaints that one of them is choosing to no longer wear a bra a work. I understand this is a personal choice by the individual and really has nothing to do with our dress code policy. However, this individual has been known to report other employees for \"leering\" and other similar concerns in the past, and only 1 out of 7 reports came to be true, though still managed to damage other workers reputations as gossip spreads quickly. This employee is also well endowed and is making a lot of other employees uncomfortable as the nature of their work sometimes causes them to be in small, confined areas. Her team members are worried that they are going to be 'next' in her recent slew of reports, and don't know how to comfortably work with her. Today the other female coworker also complained stating that the individual \"seems to be unnaturally swinging her chest around and making it well known that she is no longer wearing a bra\"  I would appreciate any advice on the situation.  Thank you  HR Manager", "completion": "You have two separate issues at hand that you have to decide to handle.   The first of which is whether or not bra is required for dress code. You basically just have to check what is mentioned already. If it isn't the assumption is that her decision is fine and people have to get over it.  The next is whether you want to tolerate a employee who falsely accuses other of sexual harassment. This is actually separate from the bra issue. You need to find out why she is doing this and either get it to stop or let her go."}

Could the creator of humankind be something we don't even think of as conscious, sentient or alive?", "completion": "Our best sciences---namely, evolutionary biology---make it pretty clear that more \"intelligent\" and complex lifeforms can evolve out of less \"intelligent\" and complex lifeforms. The only \"creator\" of humans are the processes of mutation and natural selection and the environments in which those processes act. Since *none* of the above are intelligent in any interesting sense, it's pretty straightforward that an unintelligent system can create intelligent lifeforms.   Whether or not humans can create an AI that is as or more intelligent than us by any particular measure is largely irrelevant.  Indeed, for the purposes of evaluating arguments from design, humans creating a more intelligent AI is actually less powerful evidence than that which comes from evolutionary biology. After all, the theist's claim is not so much that god has to be extremely intelligent to make this all work but rather than god has to be *intentional*; there has to be a purposiveness to the creation of humans.

Aid and assistance to any poor individuals that meet certain criteria that indicates that individual is putting in effort to raise their station. Especially tax policies, like a year or more tax free when you start a business and such. The starting of the business would benefit the whole economy and giving a major tax break would benefit in the long run.  The details of the policies are less important than the concept that much of the racial tension is amplified by economic factors, and these could be lessened in both white and black communities alike with the same bipartisan economic reform.

{"prompt": "(Update) Is food pairing a thing? Hi everyone,  A week ago, I and my team started a study about food and alcohol beverage pairing in restaurants. We are trying to design a digital solution around the food pairing topic.  I posted a survey here and would love to THANK EVERYONE who helped us in our journey by filling it out. We succeded to gather 134 responses across several Reddit communities in just 2 days (You guys are awesome!!!\ud83c\udf89) Now, we want to share several things we learned from the survey.  It is evident that 'food pairing' IS a thing. We read a lot of detailed and great food pairing experiences that are very insightful (We can't share it, due to confidentiality). Unfortunately, food pairing hasn't been widely recognized by 'common' consumers, due to lack of knowledge and also lack of options (not offered in the menu). The cool thing here is people are very open to trying new things, so it is highly recommended for restaurants to train waiters to suggest alcoholic beverages when taking orders (It is likely that consumers will follow through!)  The use of digital technology in a sit-down restaurant is a very controversial topic (result is almost 50-50). So now, I and my team are rolling out quick online interview sessions/ online chat to dig deeper if there is any room for tech in the food pairing space.  If you are interested/ open to have an interview/ simply online chat, please feel free to direct message me on Reddit.

They've published books, \"what to drink with what you eat\", and magazines about this, \"food and wine\". There may not be a mainstream app that I know of off the top of my head. But your audience is super small. The subtype of people that don't know about food and beverage pairing, either are new to drinking culture or new to food culture. Maybe I'm over stepping a bit, and if so I apologise. My entire family is pretty into the food scene. But from my point of view, this ship has left. The people that care enough, either already know that it's a thing and know some about it. And the people that don't care enough, don't care enough and probably aren't gonna start to care just cuz \"there's an app for that\". Now, you're left with a slim marketing audience. If you wanna do all this for fun, then hell yeah dude. Go for it, it sounds kinda cool. But if you are gonna be putting money into this, I'd take some of the stuff I said into account.

Now, my oldest cat seems incredibly depressed since she hasn't come home from her vet appointment. He sleeps in her spot, follows us around everywhere while meowing & just seems like he's not himself. Should we completely cleanse the house of the other cat or is he grieving? Should we put her cat crate out in the house for him to smell and possibly sleep in?  I don't want my big old man to die of a broken heart.  Thank you so much in advance.", "completion": "Not a vet, but animals do grieve. I've always been told that it is helpful to bring the deceased pet back into the house after the vet appointment to show the living pet that they are gone. It is supposed to help them process why the other isn't there."}

{"prompt": "School or career? I was accepted to a fully funded MA to PhD in anthropology, then got a promotion at work Last year I applied for a fully funded MA & PhD in environmental anthropology starting in autumn 22, thinking it was a long shot. But I poured my heart and soul into my research proposal and got the scholarship! With living stipend!   Then I was promoted at my tech startup job. It's a great career path and, considering that I just had my first child last year, couldn't be at a better time. (For reference, my husband has been a stay at home dad for the most part.) But it's still a startup and, if I'm honest, that makes me nervous.  Many voices are telling me that I'd be stupid to leave a solid career for school. But I'm genuinely heartbroken at the thought of withdrawing from the PhD program.   My research project is focused on the anthropology of climate change, which is something I care deeply about. I doubt another chance at a free degree in something I love is going to happen again.   I know I'm fortunate to be in a position with two good choices. But I feel frozen with dread. I can't sleep!  What would or did you do to be confident in your choice? Is anthropology as silly a thing to pursue as the naysayers say? Is only STEM worth it anymore?", "completion": "Defer for a year on the phd program.

{"prompt": "What happens to semiconductor fabrication equipment of older process nodes when newer process nodes are developed and how does this affect active products using the older process nodes? For example, the Intel i486 was produced from 1989 to 2007 and used 600 to 1000 nm process. Intel was using around 65 nm in 2007. Do manufacturers make the older products on the newer equipment or just keep the old equipment and assembly lines around?

(Canada) I work the public sector in western Canada and what happened to the quality of engineering drawing submissions from private consultants ?   Whether it be me or my colleagues in crown corporations, municipalities, the province, etc. compared to 5 - 10+ years ago you'd think the quality of drawings would only increase but no. Proper CAD drafted civil site plans, vertical profiles, existing Vs proposed conditions plans, etc. were standard. Now we get garbage submissions, I mean okay I'll try to be a bit nicer, we get very rough sketches or even a google earth image with some lines. I get  the desire to want to save time and costs on engineering but I don't even know how a contractor would price and do the work off these sketches. And seriously proper drawings only takes a drafter a few hours.   Contractors always complain about government agencies and municipalities taking a long time on approvals but given the garbage submissions they're providing I don't even know what they were expecting.", "completion": "I think it's a bunch of issues all tied together:  \\-EI's fresh out of college are creating them and trying to figure out how without any help.  \\-There is no internal QA before submitting - basically using outside fail comments as QA.  \\-Many plan submissions aren't getting rigorous reviews.  \\-Private engineers don't want to spend time to make good plans in order to save money.  \\-They know the first submission will fail regardless, and if the site plan changes significantly they don't want to waste the effort on a complete redesign.  \\-Good plans are more liability.  If something isn't in the plan, then the money, effort, and time to fix it is likely shifted to someone else.  Also there is less chance of something being wrong if it just isn't there.  \\-Good submissions are pain in the ass.  Way easier to add a ton of fine print that says plans may be inaccurate and missing stuff and it's up to the contractor to verify everything.  \\-If there is more detail in the plans, there are more opportunities for reviewers to find problems."}

{"prompt": "Overview of Continental Philosophy vs Analytic Philosophy? Lately I've been having a lot of questions about Continental Philosophy. I guess I'm looking for some general overview about continental philosophy and how it differs from analytic philosophy. Also, where do empiricism and rationalism fit in with continental philosophy?", "completion": "If you're familiar with Kuhn's philosophy of science, you might find Neil Levy's paper, Analytic and Continental Philosophy: Explaining the Differences informative. Levy regards analytic-style philosophy as something like a Kuhnian \"normal science,\" paradigm-bound, very efficient within the paradigm, with a widely-accepted set of remaining puzzles. Continental philosophy is more of a \"pre-science\" (this is not pejorative), not yet strongly paradigm-bound. That means there are fewer shared presuppositions about method and content, and fewer \"puzzles\" in Kuhn's sense.    Another difference is that if you look at the top analytic journals, very few are devoted to the work of some particular philosopher, but if you look at the Continental ones, very many are: Heidegger studies, Nietzsche studies, Hegel studies, Foucault studies, etc. This implies (to me at least) that Continental philosophy is overall somewhat more history- and exegesis-focused.    Note, also, that many will associate \"analytic\" philosophy with Frege and Russell, but the analytic *style* (at least according to analytic philosophers) goes back much farther, perhaps to Aristotle, and encompassing most of the Moderns. That claim is likely to be contentious, though.    As for your question about rationalism and empiricism, the vast majority of entries in this debate will be analytic-style. I imagine this is because of a more general truth, that analytic philosophers view philosophy itself as a series of debates between -isms, and the puzzles within analytic philosophy as particular arguments for and against these -isms."}

{"prompt": "CMV: A society where everyone has everything evenly distributed is either unfair or it doesn't work Most of the people I've encountered who are advocates for socialism or communism come from a rich capitalist country or are poor. They don't get to experience what it's really like to live in a society like that and while it may sound appealing in theory, in practice it's much different.  They blame it on the mindset of people, but there are things that we can't really change.  It would be nice to see a world were nobody is hungry or in need, and I think we should aim for that, but socialism in not the answer. A socialist community will only switch the part of society that is in an unfair position, and it will only turn into a malfunctional system.  Working hard should equal better quality of life. In a capitalist society, if you work hard and smart you get to suceed, and humans love suceeding and getting better benefits from their hard work. That is the incentive. In socialism, you can work as hard as you want, but you don't really suceed, you can't get better things. You just get the same as everyone else, even those who work less or not at all.  If the person who works hard or has a degree in a difficult career gets the same things as a person who barely works, why work harder?? There's no point. It's unfair for those in that position, but not so much for the ones who work less.  Individuals won't work for the common good if they are the only ones being prejudiced. It will ultimately make everyone miserable because the goal is common good, but if every working person is being damaged for that common good then there is no common good anymore.  Why study 10 years to be a doctor, when a bartender can get the same benefits?? Even if you like the job, the working conditions are worse that those of the bartender. There is no point into damaging youself just to save people's lives if you don't get a better benefit than the bartender.  This will make people don't want to take up difficult (and often essential) jobs, and there will be too many trying to get easier jobs. There's no way a society can prosper if everything is about everyone and nothing is about the individual.  Socialism can only work in a society where people don't have personal goals and they are willing to sacrifice themselves for others. None of this is realistic.  Yes, socialism will create equal conditions for all: All equally miserable.  I come from a country which is quite mixed, but has very strong socialist tendencies, now more than ever. And it sucks. I'm a hard-working, intellectual person (quite rare nowadays) and I wouldn't think twice about moving into a capitalist country where my efforts will be appreciated. My country is making all of us miserable, hard working or not.  The main problem is not capitalism. Capitalism can be the solution. It may not be perfect, but we need to focus on fixing it rather than advocating for a system that is proven to not work.", "completion": "> If the person who works hard or has a degree in a difficult career gets the same things as a person who barely works, why work harder??   Embedded in this very question is a huge issue exposing a big bias.  It starts at \"or\" and ends at \"career.\"  You appear to know full well that hard work isn't the end-all be-all, but you still really, really want to phrase everything in terms of hard work.  But you can't square this circle: if it ain't hard work, it ain't hard work.  (A more subtle version of this same issue comes in the word \"difficult.\" It's obviously not the case that the *most difficult* careers come with the highest rewards, but you really want to set up this narrative where high pay is fairly earned according to the protestant work ethic.)    You have to let go of hard work. Hard work is not, in and of itself, rewarded by capitalism, and hard work is not, in and of itself, good. Under certain circumstances it can facilitate certain goals... and that can be important. But that's it."}

I'm a new engineer in a very hands-on manufacturing facility and I am having an extremely hard time getting production to be responsive to my asks.  I try to do as much as I can on my own, but sometimes we need to audit a process or inspect a part before or after a step and trying to get production to notify me when that happens is an absolute nightmare.  Even just trying to get notified when an engineering part has completed it's steps or keeping it moving through a work order is like pulling teeth.  It isn't unheard of for production to throw out engineering parts because they \"don't know what it is for,\" even if it has a clearly defined set of work instructions attached to it.  I'm not the only one who has trouble with this, every engineer here has the same complaints, so at least I know it isn't a personal issue that the operators have with me.

Where I cut my teeth we had to have it so that it was basically *another job for them to run.*  It also helped that while they owned the production, I as an R&D engineer owned the process.    One time I was having a particularly hard time getting support on a trial run.  They kept running the line, pushing me off, and eventually my 10am trial got pushed to 7 pm that night.  They didn't have the right support personnel and it started as a disaster, so I did the only thing I could in my power, I shut the line down for being out of spec.  I told the line supervisor that any product he ran, would be rejected until further notice (which had a whole cascade effect on where it could go).  I signed my name on the shutdown tag, and told them I'd see them in the morning.  I walked into a shit storm the next morning with the plant manager ready to chew me out.

{"prompt": "CMV: \u201cObjective quality\u201d does not exist in art. I\u2019m a musician, so I hear this kind of talk a lot, from fellow musicians and non-musicians alike. When I share a piece of music that I like, I often hear \u201cthis is shit,\u201d or \u201cthis other song is so much better,\u201d and even positive reactions such as \u201cthis is so much better than that dubstep garbage!\u201d And so often, I hear that terrible, terrible word...  \u201cObjectively...\u201d  There are things that you can say objectively about art. You can tell me what key a song is in, or what kind of paints were used on a canvas. But I really don\u2019t see how you can ever speak objectively about the quality of a work. Art is, at its core, about the individual\u2019s reaction to it. It is based on emotion. There are no quantifiable measurements that can determine if something is good or not, or better than something else.  Now, I agree that there are often cultural standards by which we judge art. A Monet painting is generally considered to be better than a stick figure. But is that because of some innate quality within it, or is it because we have been raised in an environment that teaches us a preference? Someone who grows up listening to rap will probably think that rap is better than jazz, for instance. As further evidence, entire artistic movements throughout history have been dedicated solely to destroying these standards. Dadaism and the music of John Cage are conspicuous examples. These movements were never about making \u201cbad\u201d art, but rather art that doesn\u2019t fit the societal standard.  I guess the summary of my belief is that elitism is dumb, because there is no objective measure of quality in art. I think people need to recognize that if they don\u2019t like a piece, it\u2019s not because that piece is bad, but because they have not had the cultural background needed to appreciate it.  Anyway, let me know what you think.", "completion": "You're trying to grade art objectively on a scale of \"good/bad\" which is a paradox- an objective measure of a subjective scale? Objective taste? Obviously that's an oxymoron. However, there are plenty of other scales you could apply to a work of art. In a performance piece like singing or playing an instrument, you can objectively measure how close a human is to accurately producing the correct notes and the correct timing for the sheet music which is objectively written in ink. For a painting you can objectively measure things like how precise someone's brush strokes are (think here precision sign makers, calligraphers, people who copied books by hand looking like print in the medieval period). In film you can objectively note things like how clean the audio sounds (is there a ton of clearly unintended hiss, pops, distortion etc...?) poor use of the camera and light resulting in blown out images, etc....   There are ways to objectively, not just subjectively, compare the production values that go into a piece of art which separates works with the quality, experience, and motivation of a high school class project versus a professionally made work of art."}

{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old: Why was the historical development of beer more important than that of other alcoholic beverages?", "completion": "This is something I can contribute to very well. I've given lectures at universities and museums on the history of beer. It's a fascinating topic that I love delving in to. If I go long my apologies, but beer is so important to our civilization.   As has been stated several times in this thread, it's the reason why we became an agricultural society instead of just hunter/gatherers. It's the reason we have society. In early Mesopotamia it was also used as currency. Hell, Jewish slaves were paid in bowls of beer, it wasn't beer as we know it today, but it was a porridge-like substance that was created with grain and water. The pyramids were built on beer.  I stated earlier that the reason why wine is used in Christianity is because it was easy to grow grapes in Italy and as Christianity spread through the Roman Empire that became the norm. If you couldn't grow grapes you had to buy it from Italians and thus helping their economy. It that time beer became a lesser drink in the eyes of many.   As beer became a drink and not just for food its secrets were passed down through the monks. Which has also been stated several times in this thread. What I havent seen mentioned is the importance of Reinheitsgebot. In 1514 Bavaria passed a law stating that beer could only be malted grain (barley, oats, wheat, rye), hops, and water (later amended to include yeast).  This is significant because it was the first food law passed in the history of humanity. At the time people were trying to balance out the sweetness of beer with whatever they could find. It was called gruit  and it could include figs, dates, sticks, and even charcoal (again, not as refined as we know it today). Beer was important because it kept people alive, but some of the ingredients were killing people or making them sick. They decided on hops because, like the Counsel of Nicaea, they chose an available crop that was easy to grow in the area. Hops.  Hops became the standard for the bittering agent in beer because both Germany and England could grow them and it helped the local economy.   Beer also helped the Champagne region of France with exploding bottles. The Belgians have many styles of beer that have residual sugars still in them, much like champagne. The Belgians figured out that if you have a flat bottom bottle the residual sugar can continue to build up CO2. If it builds up enough over time, it'll explode. The Belgians put a divot in the bottle to break up the amount of concentrated sugar in one area and thus the bottles wouldn't explode.  Pasteur was looking at wine when he discovered yeast, but IIRC refrigeration was developed to cool wort quicker. I have to look that up though.   Beer took a big hit after prohibition in America. With the WWII soldiers coming home from Germany and developing a love for the taste of pilsners, and the rise of Bud and Miller, beer was thought as a one trick pony.  It wasn't until Carter passed a law in the 70's allowing for homebrewing that we see the start of the rise of craft beer in America. Styles that were dead became revitalized (i.e. IPA) and depth of the beverage really started to emerge.  Beer is incredibly important to us as a society. It helped form us and shape how we became. I can literally talk for hours on the subject. This is the cliffs notes version that I can pull from memory, I'd need to do more homework to get it down a bit more proper. But, until I can get paid for it, why the hell am I going to do it."}

(PhD in Economics to be exact but any insight from any discipline would be very helpful).", "completion": "Are you in the US?  Most PhD program start with a year or two of coursework first which is a master's degree.  That why you can \"master out\" of many programs where you complete the courses but don't pass the comps/quals to move into doctoral candidacy.  So basically, the master's is built in.  Doing a separate master's degree often means it will take you longer to graduate (you will repeat course work in your doc program) and cost you more (master's programs rarely give assistantships)."}

{"prompt": "has anyone here earned a PhD that was paid for by their company? how did you go about applying for it?", "completion": "This is based off my experience and there are lots of exceptions!! Most PhD in engineering are funded through the university. Also, while I'm sure there are exceptions, generally it is expected that a PhD student is full time. Most PhD students need to gather their own research and in my experience the university labs target normal working hours that I suspect an engineering company would overlap with. I suspect you find it challenging to work through a PhD while doing a full-time gig.   It will all depend on what your PhD sponsor is willing to do though. PhD programs are not as structured as a masters or undergraduate degree so if you are set on this route, with patience I'm sure you can find something that works!  Many masters programs are developed around the full-time working engineer. If you are interested in working full time and would like to advance your education further, personally, I'd advise you look at this route first!   Kudos to you for wanting to invest time in learning and developing yourself further!  TLDR; consider a masters, if set on a PhD have patience to find a mentor willing to be flexible with a full-time engineer."}
{"prompt": "Need advice - Biomedical postdoc Hello everyone, I am a Postdoc in biomedical engineering, working on AI models for biological and clinical data. I did my PhD in Bioinformatics and a 1-year Postdoc (again Bioinformatics) in a prestigious university before joining my current position.  In my current postdoc, almost a year in, I\u2019ve written 2 papers and a third paper is near completion. Additionally I teach lab practicals, prepare course materials, mentor students, and regularly update my progress with my PI (at least once a week). I have also helped with a grant application and some papers I am not directly involved with. I consider myself a fairly average postdoc and work about 50-60 hours a week.  My PI keeps telling me my performance in my current position is very poor and that I am in danger of termination. I\u2019ve been told this 4 times over the past year. When I request help with understanding her expectations I am rebuffed and my PI becomes aggressive. It\u2019s common for her to bang the table, question my credentials and use verbal put-downs like \u201care you kidding me! I feel like I\u2019m dealing with a PhD student\u201d. Lately I\u2019ve been asked to take up non-urgent tasks on the weekend, and I also get berated on things I have no control over, such as the progress in a students project. (The project is something I help with but the direction and tasks are assigned by my PI). I am the only Postdoc in this lab and I am isolated from pretty much everyone. Attempts to reach out to other postdocs are thwarted by her (I was told to never collaborate with others but dedicate 100% of my time to producing papers) and she refuses to collaborate internally with other faculty. When I joined this lab the PI claimed she had a collaborator in a highly prestigious institution which turned out to be completely untrue - no meetings or projects ongoing with any collaborator.  Quitting is not an option for me, since I need to consider my child\u2019s schooling and more importantly, the laws are skewed towards my employer. My employer may legally \u2018fine\u2019 me for up to 3 months of pay, which I can\u2019t afford (I only got to know this law once I had been onboarded). I take records of all our interactions. I am trying to cultivate mental toughness so that her behavior does not get to me.  What should my output be in biomedical research as a postdoc, specifically in my field? I\u2019m thinking that since I work overtime a lot during my weekends I might as well reach out to external faculty for guidance and work on a small paper of my own instead to prop up my record and get a letter of recommendation. Is this a good plan of action? Thanks in advance.", "completion": "As a PI - I know this isn't what you want to hear, but you should leave. You don't need the LOR if you have 3 manuscripts written in a year - this is all you need for proof of your productivity. It's absolutely not unusual for postdocs to find that a lab is not a good fit and to move on in the first year. No-one cares. PIs know and understand that this happens. After 2-3 years it will get harder to leave without a LOR, not easier. And if you're having these issues now I guarantee they will escalate.   Don't put this crazy person in charge of your future. You're giving her far too much power and rest assured she's going to use it against you. Put some feelers out, explain \"it just wasn't a good fit\" and find a better boss.   Regarding the 3 months thing, closely review your contract, assuming you even have one - I find it really unlikely that this is legally viable unless you signed a contract saying it was ok. Postdocs are usually \"at will\" which means she could sack you tomorrow for almost any reason without penalty, and you can similarly walk out tomorrow. But even if you need to give 3 months' notice, in the US and across much of the world EVERYONE is desperate for postdocs right now, you're in a good position to ask for this.   Get out, you seem to think this is the safe option, not realising that you're putting your family in a far more precarious position by staying with this person. If you stay she's going to hold these issues over you until she's done with you, probably 6+ years. In the meantime, you were working 60h/week and you miss all those formative years with your kids. It's. not. worth. it. PM me if you want to talk further. You can do this."}
{"prompt": "CMV: Being vegan or vegetarian has no real impact on the meat and dairy industry, therefore being meaningless Everyone has heard of the terrible conditions cows, chickens and pigs go through in slaughterhouses (Watchmen *Okja* on Netflix to know a bit more), and movements pro-veganism and what not.  While I agree that meat production in an industrial scale is an awful thing, some people not eating animal products wouldn't change a thing. Corporations don't go meatless options because they care about the animals, it's because some people are willing to buy It.   And for every vegan, there are 10 more people who eat meat normally. If a couple of people don't buy beef out of a whole city It won't really matter.  I'm not sure the text was able to trully express my idea, english is not my first language.", "completion": "But given that if everyone was vegan, the meat and dairy industries would not continue to be profitable - it is obvious that veganism is an effective means of consumer protest.

I know softwares such as LAMMPS and Materials Studios can be used to perform molecular scale models. However the process is very slow (took me days to simulate a simple failure analysis) and the setup takes a very long time to get all the parameters right.  I was wondering if there are other softwares that can be used to model corrosion and take into account parameters such as electrochemistry, temperature, loading, etc...  Thank you!", "completion": "From a practicality standpoint corrosion is usually just tested.  The Ansi salt spray test is a pretty standard test to use where a material sample is exposed to a 5% salt spray, generally at temperatures between 35C and 50C, for usually ~1000hrs, though it can be as long or short as you really want.  Really 90% of erosion and corrosion data is provided from feedback from customers and field service engineers."}

The biggest one is the idea that culture respects national boundaries. Culture, like humans, is fluid, constantly mixing and merging with those around us.  For starters, I recommend looking into historian Eric Hobsbawm to understand how young the idea of the nation-state is, and how those in power have an interest in fabricating the notion of \"national culture\". If you're looking at culture in Japan, much of their culture was influenced by previous Chinese dynasties, the ever-evolving spread of Buddhism, and importation and manipulation of foreign words into Japanese (gairaigo) to adapt to modern concepts. Also consider indigenous groups like the Ainu in Hokkaido and various Ryukuan people of Okinawa who have had their cultures repressed to fit a national culture imposed by past Japanese governments.  I have done a few podcast episodes specifically addressing these issues when considering Japan if you're interested:  * Japanese as \"Other\" with Dr Chris Harding: https://japaninnorwich.org/2022/01/20/s2e15-japan-as-other/ * The Ainu in Japan with Amanda Macguire: https://japaninnorwich.org/2021/07/22/beyond-japan-ep-45-the-ainu-in-japan-with-amanda-mcguire/ * Japan in the British Media with Dr Christopher Hayes: https://japaninnorwich.org/2021/07/01/beyond-japan-ep-42-japan-in-thebritish-media-with-dr-christopher-hayes/ * Nihonjinron: The Future of \"Japanese-ness\" with Dr David Rear: https://japaninnorwich.org/2021/03/18/beyond-japan-ep-28-nihonjinron-the-future-of-japanese-ness-with-prof-david-rear/  Hope these help!"}

{"prompt": "CMV: The premise of conservatism as a philosophy is self-defeating and logically doesn't make sense So conservatism as I know it is all about \"conserving traditions\" and rejecting progress. They're always wishing to take America back to a previous era's way of doing things (hence why the motto is \"Great Again\"). However, change is inevitable. Change is an enduring feature of human history. It's an inescapable thing. If you attach yourself to an ideology that is about stopping change and hoping everyone will adopt the ideals of the past, you will always lose eventually. You are probably more progressive than your parents. And your parents are probably more progressive than your grandparents, and your grandparents were probably more progressive than your grandparent's parents, and so on and so forth. So this incessant need to be resistant to change seems to be a moot point and an ultimately fruitless endeavor. So much energy is put into resisting change when it could instead be used to have an open mind, and accept reasonable change and create new solutions for our current issues; instead of trying to use old, antiquated solutions in a modern context where our understanding of things are clearly different. Time bends in the direction of change and progress and has been since the dawn of recorded history.  I would love to hear from people who use this label to describe themselves so I can learn how my premise or any of the implications could be reconsidered.", "completion": "I consider myself a conservative on some issues, have quite a number of conservative friends, and have spent quite a bit of time exploring the nuances of conservative philosophy, so I can take a crack at this.  >So conservatism as I know it is all about \"conserving traditions\" and rejecting progress.  Conservatism is more about conserving tried and true methods and folkways than it is about conserving *all* traditions for their own sake. This does not mean conservatives are committed to the belief that existing and past ways of doing things are perfect, just that they have value.  >However, change is inevitable. Change is an enduring feature of human history. It's an inescapable thing.  This is accurate, although not all change is inevitable, or desirable. This is the contention conservatives are making, not that all change is bad (if they believed this, then they would not seek to repeal changes to the law and social order implemented by progressives).  >If you attach yourself to an ideology that is about stopping change and hoping everyone will adopt the ideals of the past, you will always lose eventually.  The first issue with this sentence is that it assumes conservatism is opposed to all social change, which is false. The second issue with this sentence is that it assumes that, because some change is inevitable, all changes are, and therefore, resisting *any* change is futile. Consider the counterexample of Prohibition, which was driven by first wave feminist activism, itself stemming from social changes which empowered women across the United States and the Anglosphere. One can say that the rise of first wave feminism was likely inevitable due to the expansion of capitalism and the labor movement alongside it, each of which empowered populations which had been previously marginalized by the social order. But one cannot claim, from this, that Prohibition was inevitable and ought not to have been resisted, or that future generations would inevitably support alcohol prohibition because it is inherent to the onward march of social progress and women's liberation. Resisting change produced a far more rational state of affairs in the end, and today, alcohol prohibition is rightly seen as the mess it was, full of unintended consequences that harmed society far more than alcohol itself does.  >So this incessant need to be resistant to change seems to be a moot point and an ultimately fruitless endeavor.  Counterpoint: suppose racial eugenics became a mainstream movement in today's day and age, but not yet dominant. Would you consider resisting the rise of such a movement fruitless and lacking value? You might say \"eugenics is regressive\", but keep in mind that for most of its history, eugenics was advanced by the West's scientific and cultural elite, who were understood to exist at the vanguard of progress, until the idea of progress morphed into something else. Who is to say that your current idea of progress will not also morph into an idea which allows for the justified existence of eugenics? If it does, would you change your beliefs in an attempt to align yourself with inevitable progress, or would you resist and become, in that respect, conservative?  >So much energy is put into resisting change when it could instead be used to have an open mind, and accept reasonable change and create new solutions for our current issues; instead of trying to use old, antiquated solutions in a modern context where our understanding of things are clearly different.  The counterpoint most thoughtful conservatives would make is that the old ways of doing things are not to be considered only in relation to the specific problem progressives have identified, but also in relation to a series of other problems that have historically occurred in their society. It is possible that eliminating the older method will make solving the one problem easier, but it is also entirely possible that doing so will create many new and worse problems. Conservatives will likely also disagree that the current culture's understanding of things is necessarily superior, and typically value the reasoning of the past if that reasoning has been shown to produce functioning institutions.  >Time bends in the direction of change and progress and has been since the dawn of recorded history.  I would make a slight quibble here and say that \"progress\" is itself a fairly new and Western idea. Most civilizations have believed in change, but only a handful have believed in teleological viewpoint of world history in which man is destined to move onward and upward in perpetuity. Certainly, there are a great many examples of societies where change was not an example of positive progress, but was a sign of corruption, decadence, and rot, despite the fact that the elites of those societies considered themselves at the height of civilizational development. In these cases, what was needed was not only change, but the correct mixture of institutional change and institutional preservation. It is to the latter half of this equation that conservatives ideally will attend to, and the former that progressives will ideally champion, thus prolonging a harmonious state of affairs for as long as possible."}

There is a place for courtesy but also a place for people to behave beyond what is expected and accepted. Everyone has to draw the line for themselves though.

{"prompt": "Mexican Melting Cheese?  This may be a really dumb question, but here goes. A few years ago, when I was in grad school, some classmates and I were having conversations over lunch about what we usually bring. One girl starts talking about her lunch, which she already ate.  She said that she had chips and queso. She claimed the queso was exactly like the \"white\" queso you get at an American Mexican restaurant, and she made it herself. The other girls at the table stared at her in amazement and asked her how she makes it. She claimed that all she did was take a chunk of the \"mexican melting cheese\" that you can get at the supermarket. Chop it up a little and then throw it in the microwave for a minute or two, stopping every 30 seconds or so to stir.  So the other day when I was at the grocery, this popped into my head and I was really craving that white queso stuff. I bought a few blocks of the Mexican melting cheese. It claims on the package to be Mexican melting cheese and is labeled: Kroger Ole Oaxaca cheese.  So I am doing searches online for Tex-Mex queso recipes, and not a single one of them mentions this sort of cheese. And also, their recipes call for A LOT more ingredients like condensed milk, chopped chilis, mozzerella, etc. Now I don't know what to do with this cheese.  Did I get duped?

{"prompt": "I do not believe that there will ever be enough jobs again. I think that arguments about minimum wage and a 'healthy middle class' miss the point completely. CMV. Alright. So, this one's been kicking around in my head for about six months now, and none of the people I usually go to in real life for Serious Political Debate have been able to convince me that I'm wrong. This didn't really feel like an /r/politics post, since I'm not really in the mood to get shouted down, and really, I don't even think this is a left/right issue at its core.  Though for full disclosure, I'd say that I lean libertarian. I'm strongly left wing on civil rights issues, anti-gun control, pro-free-market-y stuff (although really this is changing under the pressure of the view point I'm about to espouse to you). So, basically, here's the train of thought that's fucking me up:  Alright, so for the vast majority of human history, we've been in the same situation: There was always more stuff to do than there were people to do things. Think about hunter-gatherer societies - the vast majority of the society spent the vast majority of their time just finding food or raising kids to find food. Very few people even had time for non-essential opportunities.  So, as technology and social structures advanced, the reward was leisure time for more and more people. \"Noble\" classes got bigger and bigger. People who didn't have to work all day just to grow enough food became more common.  So anyway, for the vast majority of human history, there has been more stuff to do than people to do it. And our economy and social structures have been set up accordingly - everyone has to have a job, because *there's enough work that everyone can meaningfully contribute value*.  I think that technology has irrevocably changed that.  For evidence, I think there's actually a lot: For one, the tremendous downward pressure on the wages of unskilled labor over the last 50 years - people in /r/politics love to point out that real wages aren't changing, or are even declining.  For another, our economic recovery has been really \"weird\". By most markers, we should be well into a recovery, and in many ways we are. But we're still absolutely fucked on jobs - most of the jobs that went away never got replaced. That is - they were replaced with machines, or innovations in technology, or jobs that have 1/3rd the hours and pay $2 less per hour. My local Jack in the Box has an order kiosk now, instead of a person to talk to.  It speaks like four languages fluently. The person who used to work that desk could barely speak English, and got my order wrong probably 25% of the time. My order hasn't been wrong since they put that kiosk in.  Capitalism as a system assumes that people can participate in it. It breaks down when 5% of the people do 95% of the work, because assigning 95% of the value of a society to 5% of people is inherently and blatantly immoral. Are we at that point yet? Probably not. Are we moving toward that point? I absolutely believe so.  I think that during the recession, a whole bunch of jobs were cut that weren't actually productive/value-producing jobs, but had simply been skating along during the boom because, well, firing people is moderately difficult and if we're turning record profits anyway, why fix what isn't broken.  But I do not think those jobs will ever come back. And I think that this will be more and more true. Worse - I genuinely believe that the jobs which ARE created won't be low-skill jobs. I think that 10 minimum wage workers will be replaced with one white collar technician, and this process will be repeated thousands of times in thousands of businesses over the next ~25 years.  And I think that at the end of it, there will be a large population of working age adults who *cannot find jobs* and will never be able to find a job. That there simply won't be any jobs to give them - unless we resort to some kind of government funded busy work - I.E. dig ditches, fill ditches with dirt endlessly for no real productive reason.

{"prompt": "Did Robert E. Lee really join the Confederates because he \"Loved his native state of Virginia\"? Or is that revisionist history that makes him seem like a better person than he was?", "completion": "So this older answer of mine has been linked (thanks /u/EdHistory101 and /u/Randolpho) but I would briefly expand on the text there, as it is highly relevant, but being written for a slightly different question - the offer to Lee of the command of American forces - there are additional points worth adding.   The most important is to emphasize what the underlying implications of this claim is. As the initial, linked post should make clear for anyone who actually clicked through, it isn't *wrong* to say that Lee joined the traitors because of his Virginian roots, but to do so in that way misses much of the context (and aside from my response, definitely don't miss /u/secessionisillegal's below in the thread, as he drills down deep into the issue). The intention of focusing on this is, essentially, to absolve Lee of any thing that might stain the saintly reputation attached to him in post-war mythology. It both removes the imputation of his being a traitor to his country - \"He had no choice! He had to go as Virginia did!\" - as well as divorcing him from support for *slavery* - \"He didn't fight for slavery, he fought for his dear Virginia!\".  The first, I believe, is dealt with adequately in the afore linked post, even if not dwelled on, namely in focusing on the dichotomy between Lee and Scott, *both of whom* were Virginians. Many Virginians turned traitor and tossed in their kepis with the Confederacy, but certainly enough stayed loyal to the United States to make clear this was a *choice*, not an obligation. A few other names of prominent Unionist, Southern officers are present in the thread, including Maj. Anderson and Gen. Thomas, and more broadly, the Southern states provided well over one hundred thousand soldiers for the *United States* Army, with every rebel state but South Carolina providing at least a regiment of white soldiers. Those numbers included members of Lee's family, his cousin Samuel Phillips Lee serving honorably in the American navy during the conflict, and quite openly contemptuous of those who put state before country.  The second point though is one which isn't covered much in the linked post, and this is Lee and slavery. Many attempt to portray Lee as personally opposed to slavery, and again, that he fought solely for principle of loyalty to state, but the historical record rejects this on multiple counts. The first is that Lee's family benefited massively from slavery, and Lee himself was actually known to have a cruelside in his discipline and punishment of the enslaved persons under his thumb. I touch on this in this longer piece on the concept of the \"nice\" slave owner, and will quote the paragraph on Lee here:  >One infamous example I would use is that of Robert E. Lee. Although the popular image of him is that of the conflicted, but honorable, Southern gentleman who held a personal dislike for slavery, this is a fairly erroneous picture in a number of ways, but he is generally held up as a \"nice\" slave owner, which again, is an oxymoron. What I would focus on here specifically is his use of punishment though, specifically when to of the people that his family owned tried to escape and gain their freedom but were captured and brought back. He certainly didn't hold back on a whipping for either of them, and he supposedly ordered that the wounds be doused in salt-water afterwards as well for an additional burst of pain. Even if we talk only in comparative terms, and state that as far as slave owners go Lee was hardly the worst of them, that is small consolation to the two men who wanted only freedom, and were cruelly punished in their attempt to gain it.   We can add far more here, noting that these enslaved persons, left in his care by the will of his father-in-law, were supposed to be freed by the terms of the will after a set period of time, something which Lee attempted to fight against, in a desire to eek out every bit of value he could before losing control over the labor of these people. /u/sowser expands on Lee as a slaveowner here for further reading.  More conceptually though, this isn't even about Lee himself, but trying to tie into the Lost Cause ideology which separates slavery from the conflict *entirely*, the underlying implication that we have built up to being that Lee was an honorable man and opposed to slavery, so he wouldn't have fought for slavery, thus the Confederacy must have been fighting for principle. I have addressed this in many answers previously, talking here about the rhetoric of race and secession, here about claims of Confederate Emancipation, and here about how non-slaveholders viewed the causes, but the sum of it all is very simple, namely that everyone knew exactly what they were fighting for - *slavery* - and Lee knew it too, and Lee accepted that. He also was complicit in it, as I have written about in this previous answer discussing the kidnapping of free black persons, many of them born free in the North, by Lee's army during the Gettysburg campaign, to drag back south and sell into enslavement, something which Lee was quite certainly aware of.  So anyways, hopefully this fleshes things about a bit more, and helps contextualize not just the facts of the claim, but also what the intention behind them is. Feel free to shoot any follow-up questions you might have my way, of course."}

{"prompt": "CMV: The rape and incest exceptions for abortion prohibition don't make sense unless the abortion prohibition exists primarily to punish women for pregnancy or sexual activity rather than to protect the fetus. I think I managed to fit my narrow position in the title.  I'm not interested in whether or not abortion should be legal (though I'm pro-choice if it matters) but only discussing the rape and incest exceptions to abortion bans.  If protecting the fetus is relevant because it is seen to have some inherent value, that inherent value is not reduced because of how it came to be.  It will still develop, in time, into a human being provided it doesn't miscarry like 10-20% of most pregnancies.  However, if seen as a moral punishment of a woman for her misdeeds, this exception makes perfect sense.  A woman who willingly had sex must be forced to carry a child to term as a method of control / punishment by society, *unless* it really isn't her fault *that the sex occurred*.  This is much more consistent with the rape/incest exceptions.  I'm willing to accept that this is about societal **control** over women rather than punishment, and I won't take that as a change in my view though I'm still interested in discussion.  And primarily I'm interested to see if there's any rational for that exception to an abortion ban that leaves the ban with an internally consistent philosophy that isn't about punishing or controlling women.", "completion": "Consensual sex comes with consent. It was a choice that a person willingly made, and with that choice comes all the associated risks, either known or unknown. If there are consequences for that, those consequences lie solely with the people that performed the act. Nobody suffered to get to this point. And it's likely that the baby itself will not suffer if it comes to term.     Pregnancies from incest come with a high risk of birth defects and genetic diseases. I can see why someone might not want to bring a baby into the world that is very likely to have an existence of pure suffering. Here, an abotiorn would be for the sake of preventing the baby's suffering.     Rape babies come not just against one's own will, but with emotional and psychological baggage, in the form of how the rapist not just violated the victim, but then also left behind something that is potentially life-ruining. None of it was their responsibility. This would be to prevent the suffering of the victim."}

I am posting here to honor his wishes in providing this message board with an update after his passing. I am not familiar with this app, but Robbie gave me a little tutorial. Please forgive any mistakes :) Robbie had initially wanted to pass while conscious, however, he was having increased difficulty breathing Sunday morning. He received last rites from our chaplain and was sedated with midazolam, at his request, at 3:05 pm. He remained asleep and appeared comfortable. Agonal respirations were noted by the nurse at 6:14 pm and suppressed with morphine. The physician called time of death at 6:27 pm, Sunday, November 15, 2020. Robbie's passing was peaceful and without pain. Robbie spoke often of the kind messages he received on this board. I know they brought him comfort. His final posting was incredibly poignant and moved even our most seasoned staff to tears. He was a quiet man. I think his voice was his words. It was honor to attend to him in his passing. I was attracted to hospice because not everybody breaks a bone, not everybody has heart disease, but everybody dies. It is an honor to be with others as the undergo this universal journey, and it was a particular honor to attend to Robbie, who had no family or friends by his side.

They expressed regret at the news of his illness and passing. We are sharing his final posting with them as well. One last thing before I go. First, Robby expressed many concerns about his suboxone. As the opiate epidemic continues to ravage our communities, we see more and more patients entering hospice on suboxone and methadone. I want those of you with opioid maintenance to know that you will never be judged by our staff, and your medications are not a barrier for care. Our organization consults with a pain specialist physician specifically for these cases. We will never let you die in pain. Never! I hope this posting provides some closure for those of you who have been following Robbie's case. These fast cancers are always sad, but Robbie faced his passing with dignity and grace. He was truly a wonderful man, and he lives on in our memories. With regards, Cherri N", "completion": "RIP my boy Robert. For the last 48 hours, all I've thought about is him. Rest easy."}
{"prompt": "Leave Academia at 30?    Hi all,  I am writing here because I feel confused and I am currently searching for some advice.  I am 30 years old, I live in europe and I graduated as a medical doctor and got a PhD in Neuroscience. During these years I've been focusing on the physiology of memory and Alzheimer's Disease. I had the opportunity to learn a lot focusing on various electrophysiological techniques (recording of neuronal activity), 3D design and modelling, python, and various research techniques. I also spent some time abroad (1 year) in an Ivy league university in the US. I've got a good record of publications, got some prices, and had the chance to share my results in many international meetings.  Right now, I'm doing my post-doc, but I feel that this is not my path. I am gradually loosing my interest toward research also due to some personal bad experiences. My year in US was inconclusive and had a really bad experience with my boss there.  People keep telling me that at this age I can do whatever I want, but the truth is that I feel like I have to get out of my comfort zone and try something new, but I really don't know how to proceed. I like science and technology, and I think that I could do more, but at the moment I feel like it is impossible to get out of Academia (and at the same time staying in it). I have been looking for various job opportunities, but I have the feeling that I am useless out of my field or sometimes overqualified to certain positions. To make some context I am trying to consider jobs that are reasonably close to what I have done until now.  What I feel i could try to do is:  * going back to MD path and get a residency in Neurology/psychiatry or public health (I have some experience in handling data and it seems reasonable) * move out from my country and try other research paths * try to get into industry business. I am not so convinced about pharmaceutical companies because I fear that I will end up doing exactly the same stuff I do now and feel miserable again. Therefore, I have looked into emerging companies that are specialized in brain machine interfaces etc.  My problem is that whatever I think to approach gives me the feeling that I could not do it. I have about one year of contract and I am trying to improve my programming skills and keep myself updated on medicine (this works fine because among my duties I have to teach physiology to MD students and that helps me being up to date).  But the truth is that I feel I am lost and have no idea how to proceed. I am afraid of making wrong life choices and feel unable to really commit and hold into something.

A closed and locked door (or window) in a safe, stable city/nation serves more of a social function than a physical security function. It says \"you're not supposed to enter, and if you do, I am entitled to call the police\".  In places where home invasion is more common and/or the police cannot be relied upon (e.g. South Africa), there are plenty of other measures available to make a door more secure: metal doors and jambs, lock mechanisms that engage the jamb in multiple places, bars on windows and outside the main door, etc.  All of these measures are more expensive than a wood door with a single deadbolt, so they're rare in safe places."}

{"prompt": "CMV: Protests with weapons should not be considered protected freedom of assembly. That's more like threatening terrorism. I want to start this off by saying this is not a gun rights argument. I'm personally not a gun rights advocate, but for the sake of this conversation I'm going to remain neutral on things like what types of firearms should be legal, red flag laws, etc. There's a time and place for that discussion and this isn't it.  What I'm chiefly concerned about are demonstrations like what happened in the Michigan capitol yesterday. This could also apply to the previous round of anti-quarantine protests, the Charlottesville marches, or any other large protest where participants chose to bring firearms with them.  In my view, yesterday in particular was not a protest. It was more like an act, or maybe more properly a threat of terrorism. Armed and angry demonstrators stormed the Michigan Capitol building and brandished their guns to legislators and the governor to convey the message that unless the government does what they want, there will be violence.  This is the definition of terrorism - \"the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.\"  So while bringing the guns into the capitol isn't itself an act of terror, it's pretty clear what they were threatening. It checks all the boxes. Unlawful violence? Check. Against civilians? Check (politicians are not military). In pursuit of political aims? Check.  The first amendment states that \u201cCongress shall make no law \u2026 abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble.  What part of carrying assault weapons and threatening violence is peaceful? I don't care how loud or morally wrong or rowdy a protest is, but once weapons are involved the threat of offensive violence against civilians is real. We've moved beyond an era when protests were routinely met with police violence, and taking into consideration who the police were assaulting in those days (black people mostly), the current protestors are not justified in their fears of retaliation. Nowadays, it's almost always \"peaceful\" demonstrators instigating the violence, whether it be the extreme right wingers or extreme left. Adding rifles to that situation just makes everything worse.  It's pretty clear that there's a double standard here along racial lines. These demonstrators aren't flagged as potential terrorists because they're white. I think it's time to treat them like what they really are, a violent faction of anti-government radicals who don't think the law applies to them.  It's a basic principle that violating the law leads to consequences. It has been upheld numerous times in court that a threat can be deemed an assault, and there are laws specifically against threatening government officials. So whatever you want to call these demonstrators - criminals, terrorists, disturbances to the peace - they have acted in a way that violates the law and the constitution and they should be held accountable.

{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old: What is speed reading, how does it work, and why don't we learn to read that way from the beginning?", "completion": "I'm an employee at Sylvan Tutoring Center, and we have a speed reading program, known as Advanced Reading Skills (or ARS.) Although it focuses on skipping certain implicit words (like articles and pronouns,) and speeding or quieting your inner voice as mentioned already in the thread, the primary focus of ARS is a technique it calls \"chunking,\" i.e. learning to read groups of words instead of reading one word at a time. With the sentence \"Reddit really loves cats,\" chunking would have you would move your eyes twice: (Reddit really) and (loves cats) instead of moving your eyes 4 times. If you became really proficient, you might even be able to read the whole sentence in one \"chunk.\" The theory being that you could then move your eyes over the page at the same pace, but the amount of words you can read would be drastically increased.   Also as mentioned, the main drawback is a loss in comprehension. Although we tutors typically expect a participant's words per minute to be about 4 times faster at the end of the program than when they started, we also expect about 60-70% comprehension when reading at this speed. One of the lessons explicitly states not to chunk, or use very slow chunking, when 100% comprehension is necessary - assuming there's enough time. It also tends to make reading less enjoyable on its own. One of my adult participants commented that chunking literature was comparable to sprinting through a museum.    The main reason we (at Sylvan) really encourage the program is for the U.S. standardized colligate tests. The SAT requires a reading rate of roughly 250 wpm to complete and the ACT requires between 300-400. So if we would rather see a student reading at 400 wpm with 60 - 70% comprehension than at 100% comprehension at 100 wpm to ensure they can complete the tests and thus likely get a higher score."}

There are a number of avenues to follow, many of which are dealt with in greater detail at the last section of this thread.  **Expected Behavior**  We invest a large amount of trust in the flaired members of /r/askhistorians, as they represent the subreddit when answering questions, participating in AMAs, and even in their participation across reddit as a whole. As such, we do take into account an applicant's user history reddit-wide when reviewing an application, and will reject applicants whose post history demonstrate bigotry, racism, or sexism. Such behavior is not tolerated in /r/askhistorians, and we do not tolerate it from our panelists in any capacity. We additionally reserve the right to revoke flair based on evidence of such behavior after the application process has been completed. /r/AskHistorians is a safe space for everyone, and those attitudes have no place here.  **Quality Contributors**  If you see an unflaired user consistently giving excellent answers, they can be nominated for a \"Quality Contributor\" flair. Just message the mods their username and some example comments which you believe meet the above criteria.  **FAQ Finder**   To apply for FAQ finder, we require demonstration of a consistent history of community involvement and linking to previous responses and the FAQ. We expect to see potential FAQ Finders be discerning in what they link to, ensuring that it is to threads which represent the current standards of the subreddit, and they do so in a polite and courteous manner, both to the 'Asker', and also by including a username ping of the original 'Answerer'.  **Revoking Flair**  Having a flair brings with it a greater expectation to abide by the subreddit's rules and maintain the high standard of discussion we all like to see here. The mods will revoke the flair of anybody who continually breaks the rules, fails to meet the standard for answers in their area of expertise, or violates the above mentioned expectations. Happily, we almost never have to do this.  **Additional Resources**  Before applying for flair, we encourage you to check out these resources to help you with the application process:  * Our Rules Roundtable on what a 'Good Answer' looks like * Our Wiki Guide on what makes a good application * The Previous Application Threads, to see what makes for successful - and not successful - applications.  * The Sunday Digest, and Monthly Awards which can provide many examples of we are looking for regarding the caliber of flaired users.", "completion": "Hello, I would like to apply for a flair, perhaps something like \"Islamic World\" or \"History and Culture of the Islamic World\".  1.

{"prompt": "CMV: Being a stay at home mom is not a job, and it's not difficult. I've seen a lot of posts about this topic on Facebook lately,  and I also have a lot of people on mine that list \"stay at home mom\"  as their job. It irks me a little bit, I won't lie. I am a 23 year old woman, with no children of my own. I will say that I have been babysitting my own siblings since I was 11 years old (my first sibling was born when I was almost 10),and I had many other people I babysat for in my early teens.  Most people might say I don't have \"any idea\"  about the whole picture, but I have to say I probably understand what it's like more than you would think.the diapers that leak everywhere, the vomiting,  the constant crying, the bathing, the marker all over the walls.  I just feel like being a parent is a decision someone makes, it's a lifestyle change, sure. But it's very rewarding. You also don't get paid for it. Quite the opposite.  When I was 19 I started working at an auto parts factory. Very difficult, labour intensive. I lost 70 lbs in 3 months. And before that I worked at a Rabbit /chicken Packers. Aka,  a slaughterhouse. So I get a little bit miffed when people compare raising a child, where you can generally sit on your arse if you so choose, cuddle, and watch Dora, to the painstaking labour most people do on a regular basis. Including their husbands.   I just feel like SAHM shouldn't be seen as a job and it's kind of offensive to people who actually can't sit down for 8 to 10 hours a day. Try to change my view.", "completion": "To say \"motherhood\" is a job is, in a sense, a political statement.  It's based on the assumption that our culture derives one's \"value\" from their job, their employment, and by extension, how much money one makes. By saying \"motherhood\" is a job, there's a stance that there is just as much value in motherhood as there is in other, more conventionally valued roles in society. While it might not be monetary or class value, it's an attempt to reposition one's personal value as how much they contribute to society.  Essentially: it's not necessarily about motherhood being considered a job like any other, but rather that we have been undervaluing and underappreciating motherhood in Western culture for a very long time.  It's an attempt to rethink how we might value someone based on their occupation, or how they earn money. In Western culture, single adults who are looking for work and unemployed or on welfare aren't considered as valued as those who are employed, because they're not contributing to society. As well, the more money you earn, the more you are valued. (I don't think these are unfounded statements.)  Consider how you would feel that instead of \"motherhood\", someone said \"volunteer\" as their job. They work 80 hours a week for no pay, helping the homeless, for example. Do you think that they have more value in our society than someone getting paid to do the same work... or less? Perhaps we might even wonder who is paying their bills if they're not earning money for their efforts, rather than understanding that they are not only contributing beyond what we may think of as \"their share\" to society, but ALSO not getting paid for it.   What if they said \"student\" as their occupation? This is generally accepted as a classification of what one does as an occupation. It's safe to argue that students are not getting money for being students, and are in fact often paying to study. However, we may be okay with that if we understand that by going to school, they are setting themselves up for even more value later on \u2014 investing in their future value. I should point out that it's not hard to imagine a stay-at-home mother working harder than a student.   Lastly, what about \"interns\"? Developing, like a student, while volunteering their efforts, and earning no money. How much do you value them, as contributing members of society?  To reframe this, what if that volunteer \u2014 or student, or intern \u2014 was 18 years old? What if they were 35 years old? Retired? Age is important, because it factors heavily into a particular narrative of how and when they will be valuable to our society. This is important to understand how we might assign value to roles in society.  Women, as mothers, have traditionally fit outside this (already flawed) model. Motherhood has been taken for granted as an automatic role for women: men get a job, and women are stay-at-home mothers. And yet, as society progresses, and women have fought for the right to vote, and work, and earn the same average pay as men, they are fighting for equal value in this system.  To say \"motherhood\" is a job, is to fight to have motherhood valued for what it is: a relevant and important contribution to society, much like a job is...  AND they're not even getting paid for it.  * *  TL;DR: It's not necessarily about motherhood being considered a job like any other, but rather that we have been undervaluing and underappreciating motherhood in Western culture for a very long time. We should consider a stay-at-home mother as having as much value to society as someone who has a job.  EDIT: typos and tl;dr"}

{"prompt": "How do I store tomatoes until I have enough to make sauce with? I grow tomatoes and the harvest is slowly coming in. However, I'm only getting a few tomatoes at a time so that means I have to wait a while (maybe another week or two?) to have enough to make sauce with. I'm afraid that the ones I've picked will have gone bad by then.  So how do I store them and preserve their flavor until then?

Also, if I should freeze them, should I roast them beforehand or afterwards? I'm trying to make roasted tomato sauce.", "completion": "Okay, hear me out. Cut out the stem spot and chop them however you prefer. Weigh a ziploc bag. Note the weight of the bag, then add the tomatoes and weigh them (subtracting the weight of the bag.) add salt equal to 2% of their weight. Mush them up a bit in the bag before pressing out pretty much all of the air.   Leave this bag sitting out on the counter for between 4 days and a week. You can open the bag every couple days and taste the tomatoes. They will ferment and get super delicious during this time, but they also will be preserved. Once you like how they taste, just throw them in the fridge (still with as little air as possible.) They keep for weeks this way.   When it\u2019s time to make your sauce, use half fermented tomatoes and half fresh.

This is an argument that I see a lot around the minimum wage topic but to me it seems like more of an emotional argument that doesn't consider real economic implications.  I personally am the type to assume large minimum wage increases don't actually help people and have potential to do a lot of harm. If your argument is that companies that can afford to pay their employees more should I can at least understand that.  I don't understand the argument that companies deserve to go out of business anyways if that's what a minimum wage increase causes.  I don't understand the idea that going out of business and not paying anything is a better alternative to not paying what is seen as enough.  You could also just as easily say \"if your skills aren't capable of creating value over $15 you don't deserve to have a job.\"  obviously that's a very different argument but it seems like the outcomes from the arguments are identical.

I think there's a compelling use-case for minimum wage laws because what is profitable is not necessarily in the interest of public welfare or even individual welfare. Think of any big company and the potential harm that they reap when we roll back regulations on them. If we accept that businesses are only in business to chase profits then they are not going to chase paying people fairly. They will try to find ways to undercut worker's wages by necessity. Especially think of large companies like Walmart that can barge into poor communities, run out local businesses, and then exploit the population because it has effectively destroyed the business diversity.

{"prompt": "What prevents the \"polishing\" of any white surface to make it a mirror? To my (limited) understanding, the only difference between a mirror and a piece of paper is the way light is reflected off the surface, with a mirror being perfectly predictable and paper creating a bunch of \"noise.\" They both reflect all wavelengths of visible light, but one is opaque. Is that because of the surface texture of the paper, and if so, why can't all white objects become perfectly reflective with enough polishing? If it's down to a molecular scale, is there a chemical treatment that can have that effect?", "completion": "A lot of people are explaining why it's difficult to polish paper to create a smooth enough surface (ie; it's not dense enough, it doesn't have a distributed electron field like a metal, etc) to reflect well, but another thing to consider about this specific example is that you'd want your mirror to be opaque: paper is generally not opaque; some of the light that reaches it bounces back the way it came (see; holding a piece of paper between you and the nearest light source).

{"prompt": "CMV: We are going to have to come up with a better term than \"LGBTQIA+\" When I was young, the word \"gay\" meant anyone with a same-sex orientation. Then \"gay\" acquired more of a connotation of just gay men, so instead of just \"gay rights\",  people started referring to \"gay and lesbian rights\" to be more inclusive. Then, I still remember the day in college that our on-campus chapter of GLAAD was renamed BGLAAD to include people with a bisexual orientation. Shortly after that, because the discrimination trans people face is similar in a lot of ways, we shifted again to \"LGBT\", which is still pretty easy to say and most people, even those outside the community, knew what all the letters stood for and what groups they represented.   But now, it's evolved to \"LGBTQIA+\", which is only three syllables shorter than \"antidisestablishmentarianism\", the longest word in the English language. Most people saying it bog down around the Q as they struggle to remember how the rest of it goes, and even when they get there, they're not exactly sure what the letters stand for or what groups they represent. Worst of all, I'm sure we're still not representing everyone who feels like part of the community. Are we just going to keep on adding letters indefinitely? And to me, at least, the current term isn't egalitarian within the movement; rather, the groups listed first are always included, while those at the end have a \"tacked-on\" feel and are sometimes omitted, implying they are less important. In a community so damaged already by marginalization, wouldn't a more egalitarian term be better?

Now if Crayola, trying to accommodate, decides to add pink to their crayons, do they re-brand as \"crayons + pink?\" Or do they just keep saying it's a box of crayons? Most people would say, do the latter, right?  But now you have an issue. What if a large number of people *only want certain colors not available in the old base set*? Do you just keep adding \"+ color(s)\" to the box? Do you create a whole separate set of colors that, only gets sold in niche stores because 70% of people are just fine with the base 8 colors?  If you do that, there's a really good possibility down the road that updates or changes to the crayon formula - maybe they put more money into developing safe-to-ingedt dyes - will leave out those \"created-for-diversity-sake\" niche color formulas.  And it's really easy to say \"well, yeah, nobody uses pink to color anyway, so we'll exclude it in the main box but keep it in the big, more expensive box.\" But what if the reason nobody uses pink is *because* it's harder to find, and actually a ton of people *would* prefer to use it if they knew it was an option in the first place?  This is essentially the issue with labeling a group that prioritizes inclusiveness while also trying to establish a long-lasting consistency. It's not a problem unique to the LGBT+ community - hell, black Americans, who most would think have a fairly easy time identifying a unifying characteristic, have changed their identifying terminology from \"negro\" to \"African-American\" to \"black\" back to \"African American\" just in the last fifty years.   People are really good at recognizing when they aren't included, but really bad at recognizing who they exclude, and also really bad as seeing whom they accidently include when they try to generalize. So the issue with GSM is the same as with LGBT+. By really making it a blanket term, and especially by making \"minority\" a part of the term, you are conversely including anyone with alternative views on binary gender and(/or?) sexuality, but also forcing them to identify as minority (if you've ever had a conversation with gender/sexuality historians, you'd know how complicated that term becomes in this space).  Fact is, LGBT+ currently wins out only because it has cultural recognition behind it. So, the fight is as much a cultural one as it is one with the language we use. The academic and institutional cultures are in a phase of rebellion, to challenge norms and embrace inclusion, which is why their best answer is just to keep tacking letters on to the end of the term to empower them outside of the \"+\".  Personally, my colleges alternate gender or sexuality group started using \"Q+\" to identify themselves. I personally loved it, but I also didn't mind the association with it's dictionary definition of \"strange or odd\"need when I know it was/could be a deterrent for others. They had reverted back to \"LGBTQIA2-S+\" by the time I graduated. (2-S being two-spirited, for the Native People's community)."}

As I understand it, fear is essentially a warning system to alert you that you are in danger, and encourage you to take action (the Fight or Flight reflex). That being the case, why is it so common for people to freeze up, faint, or become catatonic, when these responses prevent them from reacting to the threat, and places them in more danger?

{"prompt": "In the event of an unplanned pregnancy, I believe that if the father wants an abortion but the mother does not, the father should be exempt from paying child support. CMV Both the man and woman are equally responsible for an unplanned pregnancy.  My reasoning is that if the man wants to keep the baby but the woman wants an abortion, the woman gets to choose. I'm fine with this.  If the woman wants to keep it but the man does not, I think the man should not be able to insist on an abortion, but he shouldn't be expected to support the child.  I'd also propose that the man has to make his intentions clear before the latest stage at which an abortion can be legally performed. If he decides not to support it, he cannot later claim any custody of the child. If he decided to support it, he cannot later renege on this decision.  For the sake of this CMV, we'll assume it's a standard unplanned pregnancy. No rape, no health complications.", "completion": "Eventually, as developers are working on such things now, there will be a means of semi-permanent birth control for men, akin in efficacy to an IUD. When this comes into play, condom failures and pill forgetfulness will not interfere with a man's desire not to get pregnant.  When the man could have this choice open to him, it makes sense that he take it if he doesn't want a child. Child support could continue to operate as it does now, and men can shed that responsibility by reliably keeping his sperm out of the picture.  Sounds like a solution to me: the woman retains authority over her own body, the children born are provided-for, and men who don't want to be fathers have an easier, fairer, and politer means of making sure they don't become fathers.  All that being said, it is still sensible for such a man to take as many other precautions as possible, including condoms, until better male birth control comes into play. Obviously a man can't very well go around banging without protection expecting women to undergo the emotional hardship of an abortion whenever things ... er, *go south*."}
{"prompt": "Entry level engineer struggling to stay afloat in my job - is it time I quit? Hi, I\u2019ve been at my job now for just under a year and a half. This is my first real job out of college aside from 2 internships and 2 co-ops. Lately, I have really, REALLY been struggling to keep up with my job. At any given time I\u2019m managing 12-15 different things and I\u2019m always confusing my projects, tasks, and what I need to do. I\u2019m trying everything I can to stay organized, writing everything down, trying to improve my own system how I keep track of things, yet every time something slips through the cracks. Every time I turn around I\u2019ve made a new mistake and seriously fuck up.   The past couple weeks have been especially rough. I\u2019ve been getting some tough criticism from my coworkers, customers, and even my boss because of my mistakes. I\u2019m holding people up from their jobs, costing time, and pissing off my coworkers. I\u2019m continuing to humiliate myself in front of everybody from what I don\u2019t know or get confused. I always say I feel like I\u2019m learning 8 different languages all at once, I\u2019m always mixing them up,and they\u2019re always changing. I\u2019m constantly late on getting things done, and by the time I realize it\u2019s late, it\u2019s a huge issue already.  This week, my boss again reiterated how I\u2019m struggling, and that I should be more independent at this point. She asked me what she could do to help and I honestly don\u2019t know. Today, after making a mistake in front of a customer and making us look bad, I got a long, angry message from my coworker which she CC\u2019d her boss in. He jumped in with even more frustration. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if they talked to my manager about me. I spent over an hour crying in the bathroom after that, I hit my breaking point. The past two weeks alone I have cried at least 4 or 5 times.   I try really hard to not let my job affect my personal life, but it\u2019s really starting to get to me, I constantly have this chip on my shoulder. I don\u2019t even know at this point if I can be helped.   In a month or two we will be having mid year performance reviews and I\u2019m already terrified.  I *NEVER* get any form of positive feedback on what I\u2019m doing right or even a mere thank you, because frankly I\u2019m just not doing anything well. I\u2019m seriously starting to wonder if I just can\u2019t live up to the demands of this job and if it\u2019s time for me to move on. That being said, I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll have the same problems if I go somewhere else. I don\u2019t know how I can help myself or if there\u2019s anything my employer can do for me, I just know I\u2019m constantly holding my team back and feel I\u2019m utterly failing at this job.

If not, this is something you should be able to ask your manager to do for you. Once you have them force ranked, STOP working on anything below the top 3 to 5 until those are fully on track waiting on others and you feel like you can take on more, then start the next one or two, etc. Until you are full. It is very rare someone can actively move more than 2 to 5 things forward at once successfully without making lots of mistakes, unless there are long wait times, in which case you really aren't actually working on more than a few things at once. Communicate to your manager what you are NOT working on, which they should already be aligned on since they helped you set your priorities. Learn the Eisenhower Matrix and keep mostly to the important half even if people not your manager are upset you aren't working on their urgent thing. Successfully managing an engineering workload is less about how much you can get done and far more about making sure you are focusing on and nailing the few really critical things."}

It affects me less because I am just an undergrad, but I see the effects the pressure has on my mentors and the seniors and I am starting to wonder if it would be better to get out now and pursue an \"easier\" career. Perhaps something like teaching or nursing with well defined job expectations and outcomes. I currently have an undergrad research position and will have one lined up every semester and summer until I graduate, as well as a Master's supervisor should everything go well (I didn't even approach them for the most part, they approached me and I went with it because it sounded like a good idea), but I don't want to waste their time if I am just going to switch paths.  &#x200B;  If anyone is willing to share any perspectives on this, I would greatly appreciate it.

I'll leave academia in January. When I finished my PhD in March, I was sure I would stay in academia. I even got postdoc offers at great labs abroad and it still feels like a waste to pass on them.   But the more I thought about what that means, the less I was into that life style. I'm in my thirties, so I won't have job security for *at least* 10 more years. Most of that time I probably wouldn't even be sure what I'll do the following year. My granny fell sick this year, so working within 2 hours of my family got also more important. My partner was reluctant on moving abroad (especially the States), so how we would have handled our relationship was open and any big plans put on ice.   A few months ago I applied to an industry position that would be a perfect fit for my interests. Permanent position, close to my family, my partner was on board. The moment I realized that I'll have job security for years to come and could make plans that are years in the future actually felt amazing. I'm now excited to see where this new adventure will lead to, it's a completely new challenge (whereas postdoc would have been more of the same). I am grieving my academic career but the negatives just were too big for me. I don't think this means I failed, it just means my priorities lie somewhere else than advancing that specific career. And as said, this is anyway the norm, most people drop out sooner or later, either by choice or because they fail to secure a tenured position. I was curious to see how far I would make it but ultimately leaving now on my own terms probably beats having to leave because I have to or getting stuck at a position I'm not happy about."}

Also, our research team commented a few times that \"it needs to be clear why we are publishing a new paper on these data.\" Is it true that a new paper requires novel data collection?  &#x200B;  My new analysis amplifies this dataset, so it's confusing why it couldn't be published.", "completion": "It doesn\u2019t require a novel dataset, it requires a novel understanding or showing a reason why you did what you did with the data.

Maybe I'm just being self-conscious and potentially reading the situations wrong but I always leave supervisor meetings feeling exhausted and somewhat put down if that makes sense? Like yesterday, my supervisor seemed very cold and distant, only offering criticisms of my work. Maybe it's just me?", "completion": "To be blunt, having read your responses in this thread alone, you seem to already have a *very* defensive mindset, which indicates a fairly high likelihood that you are reading your supervisor's criticism as hostile when it is not meant to be.   You also complained that your supervisor tells you where you've gone wrong, but doesn't tell you what to do to fix it. This is because you are a graduate student; you are expected to already have the skills you need to find out, and it is typically expected that you will go to your supervisor or more senior students only if you get stuck in the process.   Grad school really is a whole different beast from undergrad. However, if you are diligent, by the end of your first year you should have the technical aspects (formatting, expectations) mastered to the point where they are very nearly automatic, and can then focus on content."}

Also is it possible to do a non-thesis (course related) master's degree immediately after your bachelor's degree? Hello fellow engineer's, as the economy looks depressing currently (and probably for the next year or two) I am considering continuing on with my education to better set my self up in a position for higher pay and more opportunities when the economy does pick back up. And so here are some general questions I would love to know the answers to:  Do employers really notice the master's degree clout?   How considerable is the average pay increase?  Most importantly is it even possible to enroll into a master's degree program that's only course related and 2 years in length, right after you're bachelor's degree with maybe 1 year of engineering related work experience in you're pocket? From my understanding 2 or 3 year work experience is required or highly recommended dose this mean their are exceptions? If so in what case?", "completion": "So as far as I know, a masters degree will give you a leg up applying to entry level engineering jobs, and you'll probably get paid slightly more too. From what I hear from people in industry, having an advanced degree can allow you to climb more easily, and will make you more qualified for more advanced jobs that people with only a Bachelors would be.  Doing a non-thesis masters is generally reserved for people already working, unless you are in a program with a 5-year masters straight through undergrad.  If you are interested in research, go for the masters. It's good experience that can also help you land a job more easily. Also, depending on your school and your advisor, you can get your masters funded- meaning tuition remission and stipend. This is less common, but my former lab mate had this. She did a masters in materials science, worked on a project with polymer thin films and got great experience with atomic force microscopy and x-ray reflectometry. She ended up working for a solar cell company working on thin film perovskites I think, because her skills from grad school translated well to it.  With that said, her masters took about 3 years."}

{"prompt": "Are there any engineers going through supply and demand issues with their companies product in manufacturing or sales?", "completion": "Yes, I am a electronic component engineer at a very big company and currently I'm in charge of giving engineering solutions to sourcing issues on supply shortages.   In my opinion, this was foreseeable. Shortages started to impact (meaning really stopping revenue income) last year around august, but copper and metals prices were increasing since end of 2020. Several electrical parts were already increasing in price and lead time,  so everyone could have prepared better. All industries are indirectly related, so it's a chain reaction that primarily affected silicone and resins.   Furthermore, any company with good sourcing strategies should stop having supply issues by end of this year and engineering involvement should decrease (but trust me, most sourcing and procurement departments are useless). The reason as to why the issues should decrease is simple, most electrical components increased lead times to 52 weeks aprox, so they have had all this months to plan demand in advance and place orders with anticipation.   But yeah, the only reason companies didn't go bankrupt is because engineers had to step in and solve sourcing issues."}

It especially becomes an issue in the case of old media; if you want to play, say, an old popular Gamecube game, your only choice is to pirate it, or to pay some collector upwards of $100, not a cent of which makes it back to the original developers.  However, if there is a way to get that movie or game from the source, you should pay for the experience, *especially* if it's an older title.

It's not as if you could stand there and watch a section of the Earth's crust be pulled under another section like an escalator disappearing under the mall floor - plates are subducted at a rate of 2 cm to 8 cm per year (<1 in to 2.5 in).  So even if you could safely deliver waste to a subduction zone (you can't), you'd have to manage to keep it there for the thousands to millions of years it would take for any meaningful amount to be pulled down.  And to make life more interesting, subduction zones are underwater (deep underwater), so there's huge expenses and risks with putting things down there where you want them.  And they're in earthquake prone areas, so you'd have to contend with that.

That every recession guarantees a crash in housing prices. The cause of that crash isn't anything similar to what's going on now. What we are experiencing now is an unprecedented series of events and circumstances.   There's still a huge inventory problem, a general lack of new homes being built, corporations and foreign buyers buying up ridiculous amounts of real estate. To disrupt the lack of inventory new houses would need to be built in a time where no one wants to buy and you can't find enough contractors.   No one who bought a house in the last 2-5 years is going to be stupid enough to sell right now, not when interest rates are 6%, if you're locked into a low interest mortgage you're going to keep it, unless you're in a situation where you're forced to move.

I checked my area and there's only about 4 houses going for under $500k listed, 2 years ago there was a decent selection in $200-300k range, could be anecdotal evidence but I doubt people who got those good prices and rates are leaving anytime soon.", "completion": "Everyone responding to this thread is missing the larger picture.  Talking about 1% changes in interest rates and some housing builders slowing work.   Here's what you're missing.  This is about generational change not small town economics.  PART ONE - WE CANT BUY  ** Millennials have more debt, and overall worse debt to income ratios due to inflation/current economics.  ** On top of that, home values in the US jumped ~20% this year alone depending on location  source   HOME OWNERSHIP BY AGE.      Under 35 years of age: 38.1 percent      35-44 years: 62 percent      45-54 years: 69.4 percent      55-64 years: 75.7 percent      65 and up: 79.3 percent  NOTE that only 38 percent of all people 20-35 own a home.  That number is only poised to go down as inflation hits, housing prices soar, and debt locks up income.  That's HALF the rate of home ownership of every other age demographic.  source   So part one summary, millennials aren't buying up homes, and couldn't even if they wanted to.  On top of all that millennials have record low marriage rates.  All them family homes? For who.  Demand for homes is on the knifes edge of falling off a cliff.  PART TWO - ARTIFICIALLY INFLATED DEMAND  Many people point to the soaring housing prices and say SEE, THAT MUST MEAN EITHER DEMAND IS HIGH, OR SUPPLY OF HOUSES IS LOW, OR BOTH!  In reality, neither of these assumptions are true.  ** Demand for family housing is stalling HARD for a large portion of the workforce.  (See part 1)  ** House building is reaching record HIGHS(since 2006), not lows.  So why is there a shortage if less people are buying and more people are building?  source  San Francisco homeless and empty homes  So what's happening here?  Houses are no longer residential.  With the recent instability in the stock market, companies and investment firms are using houses as collateral and trading them like commodities.  Zillow is a good example.  Company that used times of crisis to buy out family homes.  They often pay over asking price, and then would hold the empty house near indefinitely until someone with the income required could buy them out.  Worked great until this last year, where they lost 420+ million in 3 months and had a massive layoff.  source  What changed?  Well right before Zillow imploded we experienced record low interest rates on homes.  I'm talking about the lowest they've been historically.....ever.   I'm talking about 2% ranges.  And then after only about a year later it's roughly doubled to roughly 5.5%.  source  But it's not only housing enterprises that are doing this, hedge funds have also turned to housing as a more stable investment to hedge against stock instability.  Source  Toss in companies abusing COVID rates and cheap loans and you've got the picture starting to develop.  Empty homes, overpriced, but unable to be easily liquidated or resold.  Toss in the construction companies focusing on retirement homes over low income housing, and boomers generally already owning homes, and we've got a recipe for disaster."}

I'm here to discuss the latest findings regarding losing your sense of smell as an early sign of COVID-19 - and what to do if it happens to you. Ask Me Anything! Loss of smell can occur with the common cold and other viral infections of the nose and throat. Anecdotal reports suggest the loss of smell may be one of the first symptoms of COVID-19, at least in some patients. Doctors around the world are reporting that up to 70% of patients who test positive for the coronavirus disease COVID-19 - even those without fever, cough or other typical symptoms of the disease - are experiencing anosmia, a loss of smell, or ageusia, a loss of taste.  I'm here to answer your questions about these latest findings and answer any other questions you may have about anosmia, ageusia, smell or taste.  *Just a little bit of information on me:*  I'm a professor of the Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Director of the Center for Smell and Taste, and Co-Director of UF Health Smells Disorders Program at the University of Florida.

It all started with a mild fever, maximum 37.6 which lasted only for 1 day and bad headaches especially\u00a0when I rolled my eyes. I had a feeling of being congested (kind of \"inside\") but I never really had a runny nose.  These symptoms only lasted 3-4 days after which I started to experience anosmia and ageusia.

Summer break is a nonevent except that there will be fewer classes to teach so your PI will probably actually double down on working *harder* on research during that time so you may have less flexibility in the summer, not more.

{"prompt": "How does the immune response that causes hay fever differ from the immune response that is utilised by COVID vaccines? (And why don't antihistamines affect the latter?) I always have a rough time aroung grass pollen season, and recently got the Moderna vaccine. I've been assured that taking my usual antihistamies won't have any effect on the vaccine working, and I believe that, but I'd love to know why.  Since allergies are an immune response, and antihistamines suppress them, what is different about other kinds of immune response that means antihistamines don't disrupt them?", "completion": "To put it simply, the immune response for hay fever is entirely different than the immune response for coronavirus and other viral infections, including vaccination which oftentime tries to replicate the real deal.  Hay fever is caused by large particles, like dust or pollen, inducing an immune response, typically mediated by mast cells which release histamine. This histamine is responsible for the various symptoms such as increased mucus secretions and decreased viscosity etc. The end result of the degranulation of mast cells (and some other granulocytes) is the release of histamine which can be effectively blocked by, you guessed it... anti-histamines!  Antiviral and some vaccine responses are primarily due to  antigen presenting cells (APCs) detecting some foreign protein, in the moderna vaccines\u2019 case, the spike protein, and starting the cascade that bolsters a lot of immune pathways. These APCs regularly scout the body and digest foreign matter, and sometimes they recognize cells that are displaying foreign material on their surface. After modifying this ingested material, they present it on their membrane on a reception that screams for attention from other cell types, one of these being lymphoid cells. B and T cells are then selected for the response to the foreign protein, B cells producing antibodies that target the protein, and cytotoxic T cells directly killing all cells displaying this protein in a non-APC fashion (through MHC class 1 receptor mediated presentation). This process takes a couple days and most cells in this pathway release chemicals known as cytokines, which induce very intense and sometimes targeted symptoms. There isn\u2019t one drug to rule them all when inhibiting these cytokines, but we also don\u2019t want to do that as they are required for the proper response needed to generate immunity. Histamines play very little role in this response and as such, anti-histamines are largely ineffective."}

When I've finished making soup, I let it cool slightly and then put it into a reusable container with lid and store it in the fridge. Takes up way less room than the whole pot (plus you can't use the pot for cooking other meals if it's in the fridge). The sealed lid ensures the meal stays fresh and doesn't accidentally pick up any funky fridge odors/get dried out. I just portion out what I'm going to eat and reheat that in a smaller pot or microwave when it's time for leftovers.  I often make pots of soup to take for lunch all week. When that's the case, I portion it into containers (usually glass canning jars) before putting it into the fridge."}

{"prompt": "Number of quarks in the Universe Maybe this is a silly question, but: is the number of quarks minus number of antiquarks in the Universe always exactly divisible by 3?  Here is the reasoning:  1. there are no free quarks 2. mesons contain one quark and one antiquark so we can ignore them 3. triplets like protons and neutrons always have numbers of quarks divisible by 3 4. tetraquarks have equal numbers of quarks and antiquarks so we can ignore them 5. pentaquarks have 4 quarks and an antiquark, so the number stays divisible by 3  all processes I can think of preserve \"quarks - antiquarks divisible by 3\" invariant.  So does that hold for the entire universe? Or do we suspect there may be exactly one or two free quarks in the universe, forever lonely, unable to form a triplet?", "completion": "This is a nice question. At high energies such as those present in the very early universe, quarks and gluons become free, so in principle it could be possible to have any number of quarks. The details of this, though, depend on the specific mechanism that creates the matter-antimatter asymmetry, which is unknown at the present."}

Cars like 300zx's, S2000's, Alteza's, and general muscle cars are a rarity at car meets. Holdens are probably the most common general cars here, and there's always at least 1 at every meet.

It technically stretches about 30 miles from Detroit to Pontiac (all of Woodward Ave.) although the primary \"cruise\" areas are really from about 9 Mile Rd to Long Lake (18 Mile) and then once you get up in to Pontiac it gets very busy again.  The metro-Detroit area has a bit of everything, though, and for the most part nobody cares what it is.  We have old cars with new engines, we have Fords with Chevy engines, we have imports and domestics, etc.  There are certain stigmas attached to each type of car, although I think people do a good job of accepting just about anybody at formal car shows.  Unlike the OP, we get a ton of muscle cars.  Mustang, Camaro, Charger/Challenger, etc.  Those are by far the most popular.  Corvettes are another very common car.  We also have our share of imports.  Honda's have somewhat fallen out of favor, but more because they don't really make anything performance oriented anymore.  We still get a lot of Subaru, BMW and VW.  We get more than a handful of Mercedes.  In my area, with as big as the automotive aftermarket is and with how many enthusiasts there are, we see some more of the unusual side of things, too.  Last weekend I went to a small Cars and Coffee event on Woodward and there was a McLaren MP4-12C, a Morgan 3 Wheeler, a couple of Ferrari's and quite a few other unusual cars.

{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old: Why do movie credits include information like the catering company and truck driver's name, while other works of art (eg theatre, novels) don't?", "completion": "Doing that on novels would cost extra printed pages, on each reader's copy, millions of pages wasted! Doing it on theatre would require someone standing there reading it out while people don't care and start leaving.. just like on the cinema.. awkward..

So it's more worth to credit people left and right there, perhaps some will even work for less pay or even for free if they got their at name credited at the end of the movie.  On TV though, they usually speed up that bullshit, start introducing the next show, or show advertisement in the side, because it's wasted time, viewers may even start zapping to a competing channel if the get bored by the credits!"}
{"prompt": "There\u2019s a trope involving disgruntled people throwing tomatoes at people, such as bad comedians and people in stocks. Was this a common thing to happen? And why tomatoes?", "completion": "Aimed throwing has been observed non-human primates, notably chimpanzees and others apes (more rarely monkeys). Throwing faeces, wet chow and other objects is usually done in the context of agonistic encounters. In some cases, it demonstrates planning abilities, as chimps are known to store rocks or faeces with the express purpose of flinging them later. It has been hypothetised that the refinement of neural architecture necessary to throw poo (and other things) has eventually supported other complex motor actions, including language and speech (Hopkins et al., 2012).  So: people who throw stuff at other people because they don't like them express million-year old abilities that predate *Homo sapiens* and that have helped hominids to hunt game and fight competing groups or individuals. Throwing tomatoes at comedians is just a late instance of this.    For now, I'll restrict the perimeter to tomato-throwing in theatres. I'll let specialists of classical Greek and Roman theatre tell you how common pelting actors with food items was in their period of study. One historian, Paulette Ghiron-Bistagned claimed that fourth-century Greek audiences assaulted actors with \"various projectiles, tomatoes and eggs naturally, but also with any food that spectactors carried with them\" (Ghiron-Bistagne, 1976). But the tomatoes, of course, are anachronistic... For Csapo and Slater (1995)  >the slightest awkwardness could result in outbursts of disapproval, shouting, hissing (or whistling), clucking, heel banging, and, possibly, food throwing.  The latter is based on an ambiguous text of Demosthenes (*On the crown*) and it thus remains hypothetical that the actor had \"figs, grapes, and olives\" thrown at him. Still, public disturbances could result in the actors and chorus abandoning the performance. A special force of theater police, called \"rod holders\", has been mentioned.  Roman audiences were not much politer, shouting, hissing, insulting and booing actors - sometimes for just \"reciting a verse that is one syllable too long or short\" (Cicero, *Stoic Paradoxes* 3.26) and forcing plays to be terminated. Caspo and Salter do not mention food throwing though.  If we skip a few centuries and look at European theatre in the 17th century, let's say that actors had it rough. I've addressed in a previous answer the question of violence in theatre in the modern era. Theatres were hardly the quiet and polite places that we are familiar with: people brought drinks and food and were generally noisy and unruly, while theatres were homes to vendors, cutpurses, and prostitutes.  British author Jean Gailhard, visiting Venice in the mid-1600s, reported:  >In point of Playes, that which is the most Comical, is that whereat *Venetians* are pleased best of all, and indeed their Bouffoons go beyond any in the world; and if the young Nobles who stand by be not pleased at what is acted, sometime out of frolick, they hiss, whistle, throw Apples and other things upon the Actors, and do such like things, which if it were not in Carnaval time, were much unbecoming the *Venetian Gravity*.   In France, 17th century theatres were very lively places - in the mid-1600s some privileged spectators were seated on the stage itself! The lower seating area reserved for the common audience, the *parterre*, was described by some authors in animalistic terms. Violence was recurrent. In 1672, a performance by Moli\u00e8re's troupe had to be interrupted twice, the first time because someone in the parterre had thrown an object, \"the large end of a smoking pipe\", at the actors, and the second time because a man was beating another with a stick (Ravel, 1999).   More policing, and the creation of the state-run Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise resulted in a more civil behavour, though incidents still happened: in 1691 a captain named Sallo, accompanied by other soldiers, threatened to shoot the actors and to run the employees through his sword, and he and his men proceeded to destroy the theatre. In the 18th century, a forceful policing system was put in place - soldiers were put in theatres, as well as spies (*mouches*) who surveyed the troublemakers in the audience. This policing was not without problems as it was prone to abuse and to the occasional shooting, but it seems to have made French theatres more \"civilised\" (Ravel, 1999). In 1776, a British tourist in Paris was impressed by the good behaviour of French spectators compared to that of his countrymen:  >During the representations here, the attention of the house is remarkable; there is no whistling between the fingers, no bawling for *roast beef*, nor pelting the parterre with oranges, but the public behaviour is such, as becomes those who lay claim to the title of a polished people. Upon the whole, our theatre, when compared to that of Paris, is little better than a bear-garden ; and I have no expectation (whatever account our own vanity may make of it) that it will ever bear any reputation among foreigners, before its regulation be totally altered, and no such glaring vestiges of le barbarism remain.  Not everyone agreed. In 1787, an anonymous French author, E.M.L, wrote a pamphlet where he claimed that theatre policing though terror and bayonets was less efficient to keep people in line than the oranges, onions, and apples thrown in the self-regulating English stages. That year, members of the parterre pelted with oranges the Marquis de Gouy d'Arsy, who had placed his chair on stage and blocked the view of parterre spectators (Ravel, 1999).  Oranges, indeed, seem to have been at that time the preferred projectile of European audiences. A French troupe performing in London in 1752 was attacked twice by spectators throwing orange peels, but the second time ended tragically when defenders of the Frenchmen responded with swords (Anonymous, 1797; note that I haven't found confirmation of this incident). Oranges are also mentioned in 1770 when they were used to cancel a play titled *The Brave Irishman* in London (the culprits were personal enemies of the author) (Rousseau, 1770).   Louis Simond, a Frenchman travelling in 1810-1811 in Great Britain, tells that the upper balcony of the London Opera (the \"paradise\" or \"the gods\"), occupied by the populace, threw \"bits of apples, nut shells, oranges peels etc.\" on the actors and on the spectators below them (Simond, 1816).  In 19th century France, the dominant fruit used as a projectile in theatre was the apple. It is mentioned for instance in 1831 in *La France Nouvelle*: after a troupe had refused to perform a play demanded by the audience, they were pelted with apples and onions (*La France Nouvelle*, 8 February 1831). In 1833, a vagrant arrested by the Parisian police was asked about his occupation: he answered that he was *employ\u00e9 aux trognons de pommes* - an \"apple cores employee\" - by the theatre Les Folies-Dramatiques, and paid 15 *sous* by night to prevent spectators from throwing apple cores from the upper balcony. The story amused caricaturists and humorists for years (Berthier, 1994). According to Pougin, apples were preferably cooked (*pommes cuites*): a talentless actor could be said to be \"bad enough to have cooked apples thrown at him\" (Pougin, 1885).   The public could be creative when it came to projectiles: the first and controversial appearance of courtisan Jane Harding as a singer at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in 1894 was welcomed with \"carots, string beans, a live rabbit with a pink ribbon on its neck, a codfish, and calf's lights (*mou de veau*) (*La Petite Gironde*, 25 February 1894).  **->Continued: But what about tomatoes?**"}

{"prompt": "Why do recipes/chefs recommend you salt at different points throughout the cooking process and not just salt at the end? I understand the point of toasting a spice at the beginning of a recipe or topping with a fresh herb at the end but salt is salt. Why wait?", "completion": "Diffusion. It takes some time for salt to diffuse into whatever you are cooking.  If you hold all of your salt towards the end, the salt will dissolve into the liquid present in whatever you are cooking, but it will take more time to diffuse into the solids. You may end up with a very salty sauce with bland hunks of stuff.  This is particularly problematic with big chunky things like potatoes and meat. You'll get bland bites of solids that are sauced in a quite salty sauce or gravy. In a stew this can be a bit of a pain. On the day you make it, the stew liquid will taste overly seasoned but your bites of stuff will be bland. After a day or two, your salt evens out in your solids and you get a more homogeneous experience.   Sometimes I like to use this trick though. I might withold salt until late in a cook so I get more contrast between things. I might want bright sparky bits of coarse salt scattered on fresh sweet carrots that have been sauteed in a bit of cider vinegar. Sometimes some bright contrast is a nice thing to experience instead of something uniformly seasoned."}

{"prompt": "CMV: #metoo is a campaign by women, for women regarding the topic of sexual abuse that deliberately excludes non-women because non-women either can't relate to the issue or non-woman victims are considered a minority and are therefore less of a problem. There has recently been a large number of #metoo posts circulating on Facebook and my news feed, where women specifically rally in a campaign relating to sexual abuse by men against women.  In several instances, I've seen non-women friends such as men or trans make attempts to share their stories of sexual harassment or abuse, but have been shut down by women who claim \"this campaign is only for women\" and that they should \"go make their own ones\".  Personally, I can't see why we can't acknowledge all kinds of sexual violence while simultaneously be aware of the fact that more women are subjected to harassment and abuse. Just because they might be a majority, doesn't mean that there aren't men or trans people who also feel the need to express their opinions on the topic of sexual abuse. They might even feel hurt or left out, despite feeling that they can relate to the topic or feel empathy towards fellow humans.  Usually, the argument goes that the reason why it's specifically for women is because including other genders might be \"distractive\" or that it might \"shift focus\" from the sexual abuse of women towards the sexual abuse of people in general, instead.  I don't see how that would be a bad thing? Why can't we include everyone, including those who feel entitled to have an opinion based on the mere fact that they are also humans (despite identifying with a different gender)?   Ignoring their pleas for recognition only increases the ever-growing distance between our genders whilst simultaneously belittling non-women and their attempts to have their problems recognised. If they aren't allowed to join in, how can it not be seen as a way of women saying \"our problems matter more, so shut up\"?   I doubt rape victims of any gender would be happy about hearing that, regardless of whether they belong to a minority or not. If anything, the issue of men having trouble speaking up on the topic would become even more difficult than it already is. Especially if we continue to consider the topic of sexual assualt to be a \"women-issue\".  tl;dr Trans people and men are deliberately excluded because women are afraid that the shift from \"sexual abuse towards women\" to \"sexual abuse\" somehow makes women less important, whilst simultaneously ensuring that non-women stay silent because it might \"distract\" from the current issue at hand. Men and women are expected to be kept separate and our issues should be defined by our genders, not by who we are as people.", "completion": "Honestly I think they are two separate issues entirely.   With women, the issue is *this happens all the time, to every woman, and typically in a way that forces their silence on the issue.*   With men, the issue is that *many people don't/won't/can't believe that a man is capable of being raped*. Usually it has something to do with the physical power dynamic. Since men are typically viewed as sexually fueled, and all teen boys are portrayed in media as wanting to have sex asap with almost anyone, and when your local attractive 25 y/o female math teacher gets caught sleeping with a 16 y/o student all the comments on the articles by men are \"Lucky Kid!\" \"Teachers sure aren't the same as they were back in MY day...;)\" \"Hey miss I could use some help brushing up my math skills...\" (to finish my long run on) they can't be raped.   So for men it is not so much an issue of telling the world that you've been sexually assaulted, it is changing the world so they actually believe you when you tell them.   Typical example: I have a male friend who told me and another friend that he was essentially raped. He didn't want to have sex with this girl but in the situation she didn't give him an option. She didn't ask if he wanted to and he was very upset but did not show it to her. He regretted it and it took some tolls on his mental health as it changed his view on many subjects.   My friend showed no compassion and shamed him for having sex before marriage. I didn't know what to do but I tried to comfort him.   Flip the genders in this story and the attacker becomes a male abusing his power and not getting consent before hand. Most people just don't see it the same way when the girl is the attacker.   edit: formatting"}

{"prompt": "CMV: Saying the game isn't worth paying for isn't an excuse for pirating videogames Lately I have seen people saying they pirated games like Assasin's Creed: Unity or other games made by infamous companies because they are so bad that they're not worth paying for. I find this logic to be extremely flawed, since if someone can make something good enough for you to want it, you shouldn't claim that it isn't worth paying for. And even if you want to play the game because it is shit, you are doing because it has some entertainment value and thus, it is worth paying for. And if you think the price is too high for what it is worth, pirating is still a dick move that's denying revenue to someone who deserves it.  _____  > *Hello, users of CMV!

Despite what we learn about him in Cleyra I can assume he can't afford a ticket but really, then, what difference will it make to anyone else if the otherwise deprived poor kid gets to experience a bit of culture for once? Even if he has enough money in his pocket for a ticket, maybe that's 3/4 of his entire budget for the year (not worth it), whereas the Nobles can throw that money around without even noticing it missing (worth it). The castle/cinemas/games don't want people sneaking in because they might be people who would have paid, but if our hypothetical states that they *will not pay*, there is no real difference made."}

I wanted cash out the on a valid cashier's check, I did not want to transfer the money.  The check is for a large amount, but less money than it takes to buy a decent Jeep, which is what I'm going to be using the cash to buy.  I understood going in that I might have to wait for a clearing period, etc.  She refused to provide me with any documents showing why, even after calling the trust that issued the check and verifying its authenticity.  The branch manager simply said, we don't have to honor any cashier's check for a non-customer, and asked me if I needed anything else, and showed me the door.  What are my best options at this time?", "completion": "I've seen some people recommending you to open and close an account with Wells. Not good advice. Then they will tell you that the check has to be deposited, and even though it's a wells fargo cashier's check, it will put a hold on it since it's a new account. Compliance set in place to make sure people don't do this exact same thing.   My recommendation is for you to go to another wells fargo branch, preferably one that is in a business district. Truth be told, they probably didn't have that much cash to give you at that moment. You may have to place an order with them, and wait for their shipment to arrive to cash the check.   Another option you have, is to deposit it in your bank. I saw that you mentioned your account being linked to S-corp or something. Then I would open a personal account with your bank. Even if you take it to Wells Fargo, that check will be on record because it's on your name. No getting around the paper work, taxable or non-taxable."}
{"prompt": "Ex-wife has filed a case, and I found out the court date by accident, but have not been served. Maine So to try and sum up quickly: ex-wife and I divorced a couple years ago.  We had one child together.  At first there was no child support order, as she makes far more money than me.  I got remarried, and my new wife and I barely make ends meet.  Ex-wife remarried, then petitioned for child support.  Court sided with her, support was ordered.  I cannot afford it.  I have paid what I can here and there, but it comes out of grocery and utility money, and my new wife and I struggle every time.  I'm far behind on what the court ordered, and have no possible means to catch up.  My ex-wife alone makes more than my wife and I do combined, and her new husband works full time as well.  Recently, I had my child over for visitation, and my father drove her back to my ex-wife's house.  He was met by a sheriff depute who informed him that I was being summoned to court for failure to pay support, and told him the date.  My parents are willing to help me catch up on the back owed amount, but they can't really afford it either.

{"prompt": "[CA] Grandmother gave my brother and me an equal share portfolio each in the late 90's when we were kids. Brother sold his when they were worth a car. I left mine in and now they're a substantial amount. Brother and his girlfriend want my half now. When my brother was 16 and I was 4 my grandmother set aside a share portfolio for us. As soon as we were old enough it was transfered into our own accounts, and it was only four years later that my brother dipped heavily into his and bought a new honda.  I knew about mine for much longer than he did before it became mine, and watched it grow since I understood what it was. By the time I was given full control it was already worth a ridiculous amount because a big portion of it was invested in apple, and I'm torn on using the funds locked up as they are, because Dad drilled it into me to leave it to grow until I'm forty something.  I don't talk much with my brother, he's done some stupid things to the family over the years and I didn't really grow up with him so all I usually hear about his life comes through dad. His new girlfriend works in law though, and I've received a formal letter from them both that the investments my grandmother made were designed to be for both of us to use not just for me alone, and his was only around $15000. The number is right but mine was only worth that at the time he spent it too. They want half of the value of mine now and his girlfriend has informed me if I don't give them access then the legal fees and fines would eat up my half and I'd be left with nothing.  The dividends alone support a huge part of my life and they've saved me a few times. If half of that disappeared it'd set me back years. I know it sounds selfish but I'm really used to having the extra income back me up when I've wanted to move. I've lived in four states by my own choice and I want to move and take in more before I settle down, if I ever do.  How likely is it they'll win and leave me with nothing? As far as I know there was no paperwork or will just my grandmother's word. She set up my brother's accounts when he turned 19, but she gave them to dad at the same time as my brother got his, and dad transfered the whole lot to me six years ago.

During the jury selection process, both the defense and prosecution lawyers asked all of the prospective jurors what their occupation was.  This is normal and the people with connections to law enforcement and people intertwined with the offense that was being tried were excused.    The strange part was an explanation that the evidence would involve physics and math formulas.  All of the engineers (four of us) were grilled on whether we understood basic physics (yes), whether we used math formulas in our work (yes), and whether we derived our own formulas for problems (sometimes).  We were all then excused.    All I can assume from this is that neither the prosecution nor the defense wanted someone that could evaluate the truthfulness or accuracy of their expert witness.  More likely, they wanted sheeple that would instead be swayed by their arguments instead.  I found the whole thing objectionable, especially after the judge's impassioned speech about needing jurors from all aspects of the community.  Anyone have a similar experience?", "completion": "Yeah, I was excused because I'm an engineer. Wasn't even a case involving physics, just a guy involved in a prostitution sting.

We have just recently started a business selling cookies at the local farmer's market. As we have been trying to gauge the numbers each week with a very fluctuating crowd, we find ourselves having a decent amount of cookies left each time.   So, the question is what is the best way to utilize these extras? Currently we have using them as a bit of \"marketing\" in a way by just handing them out with our business name on the packaging. The other option has been donating them to the rescue mission, and getting a donation write off on it (and to give delicious af cookies to people who will enjoy them).   Does anyone have any good suggestions on how to make money with these leftovers? We are a home based vendor so it has to be under certain food laws (basically not having to be refrigerated is the simplest understanding of it). Right now the idea is to make different pie crusts with the leftover cookies and butter. Then selling either the crusts or maybe some cookie/brownies baked on top. Any other ideas?  Thanks so much in advance for anyone who has made it this far. Sorry for the long post!", "completion": "OK, so... My advice here is to give them to nice customer, or customer that buy one get one free, or something like this.  Charity is a good idea. Demo bags like you do is great too.  If you have orders, add a free bags to orders.  Other than that DO NOT DISCOUNT THEM. It's bad for your business, people will buy those and not the new one at full price or other things you bake. And some people will come at regular time to only get discounted products. And those are  not people with money issue, since people with money issue will just go to the supermarket and buy the cheaper cookies they can find. Not even counting people pissed at you for not having discounted product on days you don't have any... People get entitled fast, trust me."}

I'm not sure what I did over the last year to upset the meringue gods, but I'm convinced the only rational explanation is that I've been cursed.  Aside from buying all new everything, since my last post I've also slowed my sugar incorporation (used to go TBSP by TBSP, reduced to tsp by tsp), avoided showering and washing dishes for 2.5 days (ew) to avoid any excess humidity, and not only did the meringue dance to the old gods, but I included two blood (orange) sacrifices!  So no hot cocoa bites for my family this year I guess, and maybe never again. I'm sure I'm solely responsible for the increase in egg prices these days and for that I'm also sorry.

{"prompt": "Do you live comfortably as a professor in a big city? Hi all! As in the title, I am curious if it is possible to live comfortably as a professor in a big city, i.e. say one with a 500k+ population.

I know an Econ Phd student who has just accepted an assistant professor position with 110K a year in Boston and he said he is really worried about living there with such a salary (maybe this is a 9-month salary). From my search, I also know a few math/stats professors from the Bay area earning around 90-95K, which I believe is not very high given the crazy cost of living there.   I know this is a very complicated question since it depends a lot on the specific city, field, institution type (private/public, R1/R2, teaching, etc.), and also the spouse, so I guess I just want to know some perspectives. I am in math/stats if you are curious.

Thanks!", "completion": "If it doesn't specify, then light brown sugar is the default. The difference is how much molasses is in the sugar. You could even use white sugar and add your own molasses to taste if you don't want to keep brown sugar around.  Vanilla is a bit trickier and largely personal taste. Recipes don't really have a default option on this and every recipe will work with either. When I am worried about the cost of real vanilla, I make the decision based on how well you taste it.

After sobering up, one party (I feel socially we assume the woman, but either here) says they wouldn\u2019t have had sex if sober, that they were too drunk to give consent.   In essence, the law says that alcohol can prevent a person from having the sound judgement to consent, but it doesn\u2019t prevent someone from having the sound judgement to evaluate if the other party is too drunk to consent.

We have salt flakes, Alberger (the crystal is actually a pyramid shape), various sized granulated, and micro (which is like a flour consistency).  The different types of salt give different \"flavor bursts.\"  The smaller the salt crystal the higher the burst of saltiness.  Picking what type of salt all depends on what kind of flavor characteristics you are looking for in your food.   As for premium salt, its a scam, there's only 2 major producers of salt in the US, so you are paying extra for the same exact salt.  Buy the cheapest salt you can find (that goes for water softener salt as well).  You will pay more for flake, Alberger, and micro due to the extra processes that go into making them."}
{"prompt": "CMV: Mental illnesses should be treated more like physical ones in society. I\u2019ve noticed that people who struggle with mental illnesses (for example depression) are usually accused of being \u201clazy\u201d or \u201cweak\u201d or \u201cjust finding excuses to not face their responsibilities\u201d and many other things like these.  I get how many can\u2019t really understand what a mental illness can do to a person and how it can affect one to the level they\u2019re not functional anymore. It\u2019s not something a person chooses and it differs from just being sad, or just going through a bad phase. Sometimes it\u2019s just a chemical thing that happens. People with depression can be perfectly fine for one moment and then the second one they get this awful feeling for the most minor thing or even without a reason at all. This is NOT how a healthy person functions. You can\u2019t tell them to just feel fine and move on just like you can\u2019t tell someone with a broken leg to just forget about it and walk. And no, suicide attempts are not ungrateful neither selfish it\u2019s the outcome from someone who\u2019s been suffering for a long time.   I get how many will disagree with that since many times with mental illnesses it\u2019s easier to get help and get better than physical ones. Of course this depends on how ill someone is. I also see that some people are faking mental illnesses which is awful and completely disrespectful to the ones who actually suffer from them.   My point is, we need, as a society, to remove the stigma associated with mental diseases, get educated on this matter and start treating people who suffer from them like people who need help and not like crazy or lazy ones who are just \u201cungrateful\u201d and \u201cwaste their lives being sad\u201d.", "completion": "So... thing is... You're looking at American culture here (I'm very nearly certain)...

Basically, unless you clearly have a missing limb or are screaming to yourself on the streets, anything but \"stiff upper lip\" and \"deal with your own problems\" is treated as lazy freeloading, and it doesn't matter if it's mental or physical.   I.e. mental illness that's not super obvious and physical disabilities that aren't super obvious *already are* pretty much treated the same culturally. Practically identically, actually.   As for medically: health insurance covers mental illness by law, so... same there too.   If your view was: \"People with non-obvious disabilities (both mental and physical) should be treated better\", I'd really have no complaint about it.   The basic issue is just that mental illness is usually pretty subtle from the outside.   And, of course... we are a country that's kind of full of *actual* lazy freeloaders that scream about \"other people being welfare queens\". Just look at the politics of states that receive more federal funds than they contribute."}

{"prompt": "CMV: Transporting immigrants from border states to sanctuary cities is a good thing. https://abc7chicago.com/amp/chicago-migrants-sanctuary-city-texas-bussed-bus/12233319/   I\u2019ve seen a lot of discussion over the decisions of Governor Greg Abbott, and Ron DeSantis to send immigrants from the border to sanctuary cities. While I don\u2019t agree with the political theater, to me this seems like the most logical idea and should have been implemented years ago.   One reason for blue collar workers becoming republicans in the southern states is because they fear losing their jobs to immigrants and international trade.   The low-skilled labor market is over-saturated in the border states due to high levels of immigration in those areas. Dispersing immigrants across the U.S will create downward pressure on the low-skilled labor market inside the border states, which will cause the value of that labor to go up. This will result in the minimum wage and employee benefits to rise, and the overall quality of life to increase.  Also, it\u2019s a better deal for the immigrants;  1. They get transported to a city that has programs in place to welcome and support them.  2. They won\u2019t have to deal with xenophobia in states that don\u2019t want more immigrants.  3. They are more likely to enter a community of their peers, so it\u2019s easier to assimilate.  4. Less immigrants will get deported overall  It\u2019s a win-win, and if not for the political theater, the Democratic Party would have no reason to oppose this decision.  The way I see it, it\u2019s a classic case of do as I say not as I do. Sanctuary cities are mostly located in the northern parts of the U.S, away from the critical immigration points along the border. This largely means they don\u2019t have to deal with the crime associated with welcoming migrants from poor countries in the global south. They likely receive skilled-workers from other OECD countries, who on average are more wealthy, and come from similar systems of governance, which makes it easier for them to assimilate.  The fewer amounts of low-skilled immigration also allows these cities to retain a higher minimum wage when compared to the border states.  TLDR; Dispersing immigration across the country is a great thing for both the immigrants and the border states. Political theater aside sanctuary cities have no reason to oppose these decisions as their cities are more tolerant and ready to accept the influx of migrants.", "completion": ">TLDR; Dispersing immigration across the country is a great thing for both the immigrants and the border states.  Not if there are no preparations, communication, organization, or good faith efforts to treat these people like humans. You're misrepresenting what's happening here. If Abbot or DeSantis were to suggest this is somehow dispersing immigration across the country, it would be entirely disingenuous.   Dropping off a 1 month old on a political rival's doorstep is nothing *but* political theater...at best. The most neutral evaluation of this maneuver is that it's inhumane, and Texas and Florida governors don't care about people. They're using people like cattle to score political points."}

I live in a developed west european country, and I frequently visit the foreign sex workers here. I don\u2019t see anything wrong with it, ethically speaking. Every girl ive seen has spoken english, and appeared to be healthy, comfortable, and in charge of their own business. In my country human trafficking is quite rare according to statistics, so i assume i have never bought sex from a trafficked person. That\u2019s why I\u2019m mostly okay with what i\u2019m doing, with some occasional, minor doubts. Im not rich and that\u2019s why i don\u2019t buy sex nearly as often as i would want to.  The places i don\u2019t go to are those \u201dthai-massage\u201d places. I know for a fact that i could get my dick wet in those places paying something like half of what i pay to other escorts.

Here i see where i seem to have drawn the line. Im okay with the fact that a woman is selling herself, and I\u2019m the buyer, as long as its her decision, and the decision is not based on life and death circumstances. What then constitutes a life and death circumstance for me? Lack of security, food, shelter, basic necessities which we all need in life to survive.   If some ice princess from Czech Republic would rather have sex with me than go to work in a factory back where she comes from, getting a salary that is indeed low but that would get her all of the basic necessities she needs, that\u2019s fine by me.

The reason that people don't listen to their sexual impulses whenever the situation isn't appropriate, is because the sexual urge is controlled.  It is controlled by shaming, and cultural pressure which manifests as cultural norms.  This isn't solely an \"ethics\" issue, this is also a \"cultural\" issue.  And that doesn't mean you simply follow \"ethics\" but not \"culture\".  Like ethics are central to human existence, so is culture. And by that i don't mean culture like chinese culture or scandinavian culture, or any specific culture. I mean culture which transcends common boundaries- \"Human\" culture- which in this case is modesty (it's variable but some modesty is always present, we wear clothes and behave appropriately) and sexual control  This is universal.  The argument for selling sex ignores this principle of respecting the culture of keeping sex  1) separate   2) sacred  which has been historically agreed upon. There has always been prostitution, but it's never been a \"good\" / ethical activity.  &#x200B;  The second part of my argument has to do with the human psychology. Sex is an intimate part of our psyche, it cannot be traded upon like a resource.  Sex and sexuality cannot be divorced from intimacy, love and relationships, and therefore to an extent prostitution is harmful to us. It should negatively impact the individuals capacity to have real sex and be loving to their partners and themselves.

{"prompt": "Incredibly Eye-Watering Onions - What's why these? A few weeks ago, a coworker who goes to the foodbank regularly received WAY too many bags of onions from them (I think they were bulk donated and the food bank had to get rid of them.) So she gave some bags to her coworkers, us included.  I've been an enthusiastic home cook for the past 18 years and I love onions, so although these yellow onions were small (only slightly larger than pearl onions, about the size of a golf ball) I was happy to receive them.   Last night as I was cutting them up for beef stroganoff, I was suddenly hit with chemical-warfare levels of syn-propanethial-S-oxide. I went from being clear eyed to tearing up so badly that it was unsafe for me to continue cutting them because I was basically blind. I ran out of the kitchen and said to my wife \"Those are the strongest onions I've ever cut!\" I stayed out of the kitchen for about a minute, until I recovered, and went back in - the moment I crossed the threshold to the kitchen the sensation came right back. I put on the fume hood fan and set a burner burning on the stove and barely finished cutting them before throwing them in a waiting pan. After they cooked, they were deliciously oniony (more so than usual).  I've been chopping onions of every breed, make and model for almost 20 years. I have NEVER encountered onions this strong - they are an order of magnitude worse than the next worst onions I've ever cut up. Here's a picture of one of the offenders https://imgur.com/gallery/eWitBF2  So I know to use sharp knives and all the usual tricks for stinky onions, but these were so above and beyond what I'm used to that I basically don't want to even use the rest unless they're roasted whole.  The only thing I can think is that since they are small, I had to cut many of them up to make the portion of a normal size onion - is that a thing? I would think the amount of syn-prop would be roughly the same per oz. no matter the overall size of the onion. Is the same amount of syn-prop that would be in a large onion just concentrated in a small onion?  That said, I was wondering if there is a reason that these onions would be so strong, and also so flavorful when cooked. Is there a specific breed or region where really stinky onions are grown? Do extra-stinky chemical-warfare-levels of stink have any culinary uses?  Also, any idea what else to do with this giant bag that doesn't involve cutting them up or roasting them whole?

{"prompt": "Customer asked and paid for me to build them a $5000 fence. They liked it the whole time I was building it. Afterwards, they wanted $3800 back and threatened to take it to court. What can I do? [Washington state] I work as a general contractor, a friend of my other half asked me to build them a fence around their new home. This included hauling off the old brick and wrought iron fence.   I saw the customers everyday, asked them every detail, down to which screws they wanted and how evenly spaced they'd like them on each board.   I finished up fully paid, and after a few weeks I get an email with a slew of complaints, none of which were mentioned during the building process or brought up until this point.   At this time, I was saving up to move to Hawaii with my other half for work. We were very tight on money and this hit us pretty hard, not a month before our move.   I called a lawyer and got a consultation over the phone. He told me I would pay more in small claims court costs, and they would probably win because they are customers and the end product is subjective to their approval. (I foolishly did not have a contract, but this was one of my first jobs and I learned that lesson from it. )   Anyway, in the complaint email, they originally asked for the entire $5000 back and we're adamant.  I reminded them of the $700 in dump fees for their old fence and the labor to take it down. And they went down to $3800. They threatened small claims court, and they already had lawyers, etc.  I didnt know what else to do at the time so I just bit my tongue and paid them off. I then moved to Hawaii for 2 years and Ive now moved back to Washington state. I've been back for 3 years so this happened 5 years ago.   I recently drove past the customers place, and they haven't TOUCHED the fence I built. It's still there, looking good. They told me they absolutely wanted it replaced by a different contractor and that they were going to take it down.   Can I go take back the lumber and other hardware? I've seen videos of contractors doing this and I wouldn't mind doing it myself if I had an officer there. These customers wouldn't let this fence go easily. It is a very nice looking fence you know. I wouldn't feel comfortable without some protection from them.   Should I seek legal help and file suite? They obviously lied and are still using the fence I worked for a month to build.", "completion": "It's concerning that you did a $5,000 job without a contract.

If the Queen of England showed up at my house tomorrow I have absolutely no reason to treat her any different than any other old lady. You can list all the good things she's done but plenty of non royals have done just as much, if not more, good. The only reason people treat her the way they do, and why she has the lifestyle she has, is because she was born into it, same for any other royal. We shouldn't give respect to the extent we give royalty to people who've done nothing to deserve it.

As a Brit I\u2019ve lived my entire life under the reign of Queen Lizzy 2 electric boogaloo. My parents are staunch royalists so I grew up being told to respect the royal family for \u201call the good they do for this country\u201d.  Naturally when I was a rebellious teenager I assumed this was my parents being boring and old and stuck in their ways and they clearly hadn\u2019t listened to the sex pistols which explained everything (/s).  When I got a bit older I did a lot of reading into what the Royal family actually do, and it\u2019s quite a lot. Yes they are in essence kept by the state but no way near as much as a lot of people actually believe. This coupled with that fact that, purely in my opinion, strange traditions and historical events are what make cultures unique means I fully support the royal family.  Why do I drink loads of tea? Why do I think that roast beef with Yorkshire puddings and veg is the greatest meal ever? Why every 5th of November do I burn an effigy or a 400 year old terrorist and launch fireworks? Because I\u2019m British and that\u2019s my culture. And along with that comes the Royal family. My brother served with Prince Harry in Afghanistan and by all accounts he was a nice bloke. Could easily be a face he put on for \u201cthe commoners\u201d but hey I have no reason to dislike them and to me calling her \u201cHer majesty\u201d and bowing is just part of the game of being British. I find it fun :)   So to summarise these ramblings: there\u2019s no reason why you should be respectful to any royal be they Spanish, Dutch, British, Thai or Saudi. But there\u2019s also no reason to hold doors open for women or buy your friend whiskey when he has a child. Traditions can be fun to follow and gives us a sense of cultural identity.  Slight disclaimer: just because cultures and events are traditional doesn\u2019t mean they shouldn\u2019t be re-evaluated every now and then to make them appropriate for modern day society. E.g burning Guy Fawkes is fine... still blaming catholic\u2019s and throwing dung at them not fine!   Edit: spelling of Thai. Thanks to below comment."}
{"prompt": "Why do bakeries use live yeast and not instant? From my very small amount of research and testing there doesn't seem to be any difference in taste/texture/smell.  Live yeast just seems to go off quicker, costs more, takes up more space and yet still seems to be used in alot of bakeries still. I tried asking two bakers why and they said they honestly didn't know why their boss orders live.     Does anyone have any info on this? The best I could find is some people saying there is a difference in taste but with my own testing and amount of other people saying there really isn't any I feel inclined to think its just psychology. I've heard some people say live yeast causes a faster rise and while this may be true, given how long baked goods are left to proof/frozen I guess urgency isn't a massive need for how long things are prepped in advanced.     Any thoughts and insights are welcome.", "completion": "I worked in a commercial bakery for a bit. Shelf life is a non-issue, in multiple years we never had a block of fresh yeast reach it's best before date. Likewise with space - blocks of fresh yeast still take up hardly any space.  Fresh was better because it's quicker & easier to calculate and measure the amount needed.   E.g. a basic white bread with 1% fresh yeast works out to 125g yeast per 12.5kg bag of flour. Conveniently 1/4 of a 500g block of yeast per bag of flour. It's easy to handle, you can throw it straight on the scales and cut it with a dough knife."}

On a personal note, my cat has some kind of autoimmune issue that causes tooth decay, and last year I ended up having to get her incredibly infected upper canines pulled. The vet showed me her teeth and it was super disgusting. The infection was so bad that the tooth roots were almost completely decayed away.

I was very happy with where I was, what I was doing, and the career progression I had established. I was selected for career progression and development.   But my wife needed us to relocate closer to home.   I felt awful delivering my resignation letter. I was the first person to quit on my boss, and she got really upset about it too. Many people were trying to convince me but they all quickly realized my reasoning, and they realized trying to convince me to stay meant they had to convince my wife.   On the flip side, I've been in my current job about as long as my previous job. I got a substantial pay bump. I was selected for career development and accelerated progression here as well. I really like the work im doing, it's different but challenging. My wife is happier. And I have all the same opportunities I had at the other location. It only ended up setting my career plans back a year or two which isn't too bad.   I recently signed an offer letter for a different position and promotion. So I just had to go through all the same stuff again.

Remember, you can be hit by a bus any day and people would have to learn to get by without you. You're only as valuable to your employer as your salary, and if it suited them best they would lay you off at the first opportunity. Now may not be a good time, but the future is more likely to be a worse time for a position change, as the longer you get entrenched in your position, your job, your location, the harder it is to move. just make sure you are making smart and rational decisions and don't feel bad about it.

{"prompt": "CMV: If you don't believe a person can be racist or sexist unless there is a system which helps to actualize such a prejudiced orientation in life, then to be logically consistent you need to apply the same reasoning to other beliefs and values, as with, e.g., communism or freedom of speech. In the last 10-15 years a certain belief has become popular among the left, viz., that people of certain races and genders and so forth cannot be racist or sexist if they lack power and privilege in their societies. They can be prejudiced, according to this theory, but they lack the means to actually be racist or sexist because they cannot actualize their prejudice in a systemic way that oppresses others.  Conversely, it is only those in power (as with whites and males) who can be racist and sexist, because their prejudices are systematically reinforced and actualized by institutional and historical forces.  If this reasoning is valid---and I am not sure it is---then it should be applied to other beliefs, biases, prejudices, and values. For example, somebody who believes this line of reasoning should also believe you cannot be a communist if you live in a capitalist society. Why? Because that person lacks the systemic support to implement their beliefs. Hence, they are not actually a communist since they lack the power to implement their ideas.  And this goes for all other values and beliefs. Again, for example, you can't be a Muslim in a Christian nation since you can't actualize your Muslim values in a systemic manner.  I just came up with this line of reasoning in the last few days, so I'm sure there are holes in my logic and I look forward to my view being changed----at least partially!", "completion": "> If this reasoning is valid---and I am not sure it is---then it should be applied to other beliefs, biases, prejudices, and values.

This is definitely a hypothetical example and has nothing to do with any recent real life events.  I don't personally like the complete prejudice-plus-power redefinition, and I don't agree with the premise of your argument, but I *do* think there's certainly a difference between prejudice with power and prejudice without it.

Also, very useful to acquire a good knowledge of using linux and latex if you have not.  I can't understate the importance of mastering your mathematics though - every piece of advanced mathematics I've ever studied (5 years worth) became useful and eventually not enough for the physics I was studying.  There's a reason you need a Masters or higher to get a physics job  - you need that much time to develop all the skills you need to succeed as a physics (rather than engineering) expert.

{"prompt": "My employer is telling me that the reason I have not had any federal taxes withheld on my wages is because of Biden? I started at my current employer last April. I got my W2 and noticed my box 2 is empty. I started looking through my paystubs and federal taxes have never been withheld on any of them.   Once I caught this, I immediately contacted our HR rep. I told her when I hired on and signed my W4, I wanted to claim 0 exemptions so that the most amount of taxes would be withheld during the year to ensure I would not owe anything back at tax time. She is saying \"everything matches in the system\" according to how I filled out my W4.   I asked her to send me a copy of the W4 so I could look at it. Once she emailed it to me, my SSN is not on the form, and the bottom part for the employer to sign is also blank. I pointed that out to her and said the IRS would not accept an incomplete form like that, so that is why I have not been paying taxes. She said the W4 is not submitted to the IRS, they just input the info into our payroll system.   She keeps repeating that I need to \"Google the new tax laws under our current presidential administration\" to see why I am not paying taxes. I have no idea what she's talking about.   Can anyone help me out on what I can do to correct this? I find it incredibly difficult to belive that no one in the US is paying federal taxes because Biden said so.", "completion": "The advice here is correct, I will just add that your withholding also depends on how much you make and if you said to withhold as single or married on your W4. Because of the standard deduction, there is a portion of your income which would not be subject to federal income tax. Withholding takes this into account. This means if you are making under a certain amount per pay period then it is possible to have no federal income tax withheld. As other comments have mentioned, the W-4 is new and there are no allowances. The W-4 is designed to withhold tax as accurately as possible. If you are married and your spouse works, then you need to read the form and fill it out appropriately to account for that."}

{"prompt": "What philosophical implications are there in \"The Truman Show\"? Are there any?  I'm curious as to what people here in r/askphilosophy think.  I think there well could be.  I'll offer one that just occurred to me to get the ball rolling.  In The Truman Show there is a latent critique of \"utilitarianism\" (in the sense of that philosophy suggesting \"pleasure\" or \"happiness\" as the ultimate constituent of a good life).  Truman seems to have been rather happy in the earlier part of the movie, with all the pleasures a normal person could reasonably ask for.  What if he had never discovered the true nature of his situation?  What if he had lived out his life all the way to death, experiencing happiness but had never actually been responsible for his own happiness?  For him of course this would make no difference, or at least, he would never know the difference.  But to most observers, this can hardly be considered a \"good\" life that we would all choose, if we could.  I'm interested in your thoughts on the philosophical implications of this movie.", "completion": "I think you've identified the most central philosophical issue raised by the movie- The Truman Show itself is close to a Nozickian Experience Machine.

{"prompt": "CMV: Transgender fighters like Fallon Fox should not be able to fight opponents who were born as women, as opposed to undergoing a sex change operation. Ok, so there has been a recent controversy over a UFC fighter named Fallon Fox.  She has been fighting for a few years now, and has had some brutal knockouts.  UFC commentator Joe Rogan has come under fire from news outlets for voicing a similar opinion to the one expressed in this post.  She was born as Boyd Burton, a man, and served in the military in her early twenties as a male, before working as a trucker to pay for her gender reassignment.  After her operation, she has started fighting professionally over the last couple of years.  She has stated that she picked up MMA in her gym in her late twenties, and now she is brutalizing the women of the UFC.    I want to be clear in that I whole-heatedly support her right to live her life in any style she sees fit as long as she's not hurting anyone.  However, despite removing her penis and testicles, receiving breast implants, and undergoing hormone treatments, I am of the opinion that she still has a male frame and should not be allowed to compete with female fighters professionally.  There is a reason we segregate the sexes in professional sports, especially MMA.  Men and women simply compete on a different level.  I'm not saying that there are not women who are talented, disciplined, and gifted athletes, as there are a myriad of examples of badass women in professional sports.  But, in the case of MMA, the male frame can simply hit harder and exert more strength.  This gives fighters like Fallon Fox a distinct and unfair (dangerous, even) advantage over fighters born with a female frame.  I will respect Fallon Fox and other transgender persons as much as I would any other person, I will refer to her as a female, I have no problem with any sexual partners she decides to take.  But in this case and others like it, transgender fighters are not only fighting from an unfair advantage, but pose a substantial danger to natural born women fighting in the UFC.  Not only that, but it trivializes the lifetime of work that every other fighter has put forth to fight at a professional level.  The fact that Fallon Fox started fighting in her late twenties and is now beating down women who have dedicated their entire lives to the sport is ridiculous.  So Reddit, do you agree?  Should Fallon Fox be considered a legitimate female fighter?  Are her victories hollow?  Let me know what you think!  Change my view!  (Disclaimer: If you decide to post on this thread, PLEASE be respectful to all types of people including OP haha].

How can one keep warm in cold, wet climates without animal or petroleum derived products?  &#x200B;  Thank you very much for your comments!", "completion": "In short, no. And the main reasons are that (1) the relevant animal products (skins, fur, oils for waterproofing) are already pretty much perfectly \"designed\" for this kind of application *and* (2) that no non-animal alternative resources / materials are available in those environments where such protection is needed.  Skin is naturally waterproof. Fur is natural insulation. Both are evolved to provide warmth and insulation against the elements.  Meanwhile, there are no plant products that adequately provide the same level of protection and are *also* available in the regions where that protection is necessary.  Let's also consider the fact that vegetarianism / veganism is a choice that is able to be made in some regions due to the availability of other resources that can compensate, but in the absence of modern industrial production and food science, it's *extremely* hard to obtain adequate nutrition-- not to mention all the other products that require use of animals-- without resorting to accessing the proteins and / or fats that are most efficiently and effectively obtained from animals.  There are in fact *no* historically vegan cultures. And those that have been vegetarian were able to do so because they had access to a wide array of domesticated plants that provided fats and proteins (e.g., chickpeas, lentils, flax, etc.). And those historical vegetarian cultures don't abstain from animal products, which provides additional nutrition (e.g., the extensive use of butter in Indian cuisine, for example).  Regardless... when you move out of tropical and sub-tropical climates, you reduce by a significant amount what types of resources are available, and that is especially true of plant resources. Chickpeas don't grow in the Arctic. Nor does flax. But seals live there. Polar bears, rabbits, etc. And the adaptations that they have evolved make them not only very well suited to their environments, but also-- if those adaptations are \"extracted\"-- provide for good protection."}

If they report your income on a Form 1099, you can deduct that expense as a legitimate cost of doing business.  If they report your income on a Form W-2, that means they paid the federal government and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts withholding taxes on the nonexistent $15,000 out of their own pocket, which would be against their interests and do you little damage. Thus, it's unlikely to be a retaliatory measure.

{"prompt": "CMV: The stock market is hardly a step above casino gambling and negatively influences companies who they support. (r/WSB\u2019s opinion encouraged!) I\u2019m a layman when it comes to the world of Wall Street, but my current disposition from the outside looking in includes several criticisms. I know there are plenty more knowledgeable people on the subject around so here are my points of contention:  1.\t**Reliability of success** - How is the stock market any different than a casino? Sure, you can arguably make as educated of a guess as possible based on all sorts of information, but at the end of the day a share\u2019s value is constantly at the mercy of any unforeseen event that could decimate that value at any moment. We\u2019ve all heard the story of the literal monkey that created a portfolio that outperformed actual \u2018experts\u2019 in the field.  2.\t**Shareholders have a negative influence on the actions of a company** - while investors provide the financial means of expansion and innovation that looks great on paper, I believe they more often than not become a pervasive influence on the direction and accountability many companies hold themselves to. Catering to investors over the benefit of the consumer/end user is a scale tipped completely in the wrong direction. It encourages companies to feign success and assure infinite growth in the interest of securing immediate unearned funding.  3.\t**The consequences of trading are not limited to those taking the risk** - A business can be the livelihood of thousands of real working people with families to feed and provide for. What happens when that business leans too heavily on it\u2019s value on the charts? Does this not place the outlook of an entire workforce and their loved ones in the hands of a group of traders whose commitment only exists if there\u2019s a buck to be made?  For these reasons, I view the entire stock market operation as a glorified casino for those with more time and money than sense. A slot machine that potentially puts people\u2019s jobs at risk making the act of frivolous trading arguably unethical in some cases.  I realize that an argument can be made for the contrasting positive side to some of the points I\u2019ve mentioned (e.g. The stock market can enable a business to prosper and support families just as well as they could hurt them) **but ultimately my view is that the stock market and its effects are more negative than positive.**", "completion": "I think you\u2019re too quick to lump in day trading and swing trading to actually investing. Because you absolutely cannot lump in the whole stock market to your view point.   Sure the meme lords at WSB make the day traders look like degenerate gamblers but there is absolutely a large percentage of portfolios on the Stock Market that are full of blue chip, low growth, low risk stock that end up accruing like interest in a bank.   Now if you said day trading/swing trading is hardly a step above casino gambling then, yes you are pretty much right. But a lot of the market is rooted in investment funds that have lots of diversified exposure which reduces your risk.   In summary, your initial point of the whole stock market being a casino is extreme where as you\u2019re witnessing a large scale cultural shift from relying on stock firms to the lay person with an app. A lot of what you\u2019re seeing is a very public pump & dump disguised as memes.

But if those same drugs are supplied by the mob/cartel/whatever, you are very, very dead, regardless of reason or scale.  Rorshach's whole deal is that he sees the world only in black or white, an action is either good or bad.

He told me that he ran away from home. His  friend drove him all the way.  My  little brother has a very difficult relationship with our parents, this  has been going on for years. Our parents are deeply religious and  conservative, and they're becoming increasingly radical in their beliefs  and downright hateful, and they're very strict and controlling with  him. According to my brother it has become unbearable at home lately  because someone at his school reported him to our parents for touching  hands with another boy. They lost it, they're convinced he's gay (he  says he himself doesn't know) and they want to send him to some  \"Christian boot camp\" or something. According to him they're downright  psychologically abusive and submit him to constant criticism and  harassment. I believe this from personal experience. My little brother absolutely refuses to go to the Christian camp. I'm not 100% certain but  I'm afraid it could be some sort of conversion \"therapy\"  (it's not illegal in NC AFAIK).

They told me that if  he shows up, I'd better call them because if I \"hide\" him, they will  call the police on us, report me for kidnapping of a minor and get me  arrested.

If the police came (they did), we were instructed to tell them what we knew of the situation, and follow their advice.  In our case, they were well aware of the girl's home situation, knew DCFS had been involved, talked to her mother, and in the end said she had to go back home (they allowed me to drive her, and they followed).    We looked into emancipation, but it's downright impossible here.  If she were to quit school (not what she intended) and get a full time job, and be able to *prove* she could live on her own (our house not an option) she might be granted emancipation in our county.  Or you know, have a kid.  :/    Here is what we did, and what I would highly advise:    Have your brother make a log of all the things he's endured.  Having a paper trail is very helpful.  If he has texts from your parents that will be helpful as well.  Keep a running log NOW of any interactions with them.    As others have mentioned, call DCFS.  If you feel he is in harm's way (verbally or physically) it is in his best interest to at least get a paper trail started on that level as well.    The final step we took was putting the grandparents in touch with the family attorney we spoke to about getting legal guardianship.  We were told in IL there is greater likelihood of a family member getting custody than non-family.  In the end, it cost money, but *at this age*, a kid's voice is important and heard, eventually.  A guardian ad litem was appointed who met with all parties and made a determination on where would be a better place for the minor.    It was eye-opening to me how few resources are out there for kids in abusive situations who are so close to not being a minor anymore.  I feel that everyone wants to play the \"just wait it out\" card.    I know firsthand how difficult this can be, and I wish you the best of luck."}

{"prompt": "How do I make my sticky rice... not sticky? (fried rice question) My wife and I love fried rice, but every time I make it at home, it never turns out quite how I want it.   One main question I have is in the rice prep. I always wash the starch off the rice to begin and refrigerate it overnight, but it's always supremely sticky.

Step 1 rinse til clear.   Step 2 decrease the amount of water used for cooking the rice. Most people use 1:1 for steamed rice. We use 3 parts rice to 2 parts water. It keeps the rice drier which will help with frying later.   Step 3 use a rice cooker or even Bake in the oven. We cover ours with foil and bake at 300 for 45 mins. It might be excessive but it helps us Cook large batches at one time.   Step 4 after rice is cooked and soft, transfer to a sheet tray and crumble the rice to increase the surface area. This will cool it faster and keep the steam from getting trapped and making it soggy. Cool over night uncovered.   Step 5 saut\u00e9e your vegetables in a frying pan. I will typically remove the vegetables and turn the pan all the way up so the rice can get cooked again without overly steaming it.    Once the pan is hot add the rice and seasons and add the veg back in. A few flips of the pan and you should be good to go.   Let me know how it works for you."}

{"prompt": "CMV: Congressional districts should be determined by a federally consistent algorithm It's old news that both parties disenfranchise millions of voters through their quazi-legal gerrymandering schemes. This is a very big problem as voters continue losing more and more trust in the institutions American democracy stands on. I feel like taking the trust away from the bodies that have misused that trust (in this narrow scope) by using something like The shortest splitline algorithm solves a portion of this problem handedly with almost no unintended externalities.  Most of these methods (at least the popular ones) tend to be fairly simple to understand and incorruptible by nature.   I see a possible negative externality being that some communities may be split into separate districts, when they consider themselves of the same ilk. My counter is twofold.  1. We can account for this if we choose to, though it adds complexity and the ability to corrupt the process. 2. or, so what? If the congressperson in Pasadena suddenly had to care about voters in east LA, is that not a good thing?  I guess, I'm wondering if there's something I'm missing here, because it seems like such a no-brainer and such an easy reform, it's a wonder to me that this isn't on the tip of anyone's tongue who's entered a conversation about voter suppression/fraud/disenfranchisement. It's such a slam dunk.   I'm sure there are cynical poly-sci majors in the peanut gallery who are standing by to give me 101 reasons why we can't have anything nice, but I'm more interested in the \"should\" or \"should not\" of this argument.

Let's start in the realm of mechanics and hit implementation later.", "completion": "> The shortest splitline algorithm solves a portion of this problem handedly with almost no unintended externalities.  Except that it completely botches some realities.    For example, Colorado gets weird with 5/6 districts being dominated by Denver and/or Colorado Springs.  That completely obliviates any sort of rural interest.  Similarly, Washington gets screwy, because Port Townsend gets completely cut off from the rest of the Peninsula to be grouped with Bellingham and Everett, while Seattle gets cut in half, as does Olympia and (to a lesser extent) Tacoma.  A better solution would be something like a Compactness algorithm that honors extant geopolitical boundaries (e.g., county lines, city limits, etc) where possible.   Here's the one for Colorado and Washington.  Notice how that results in Denver only dominating 2 districts, and Colorado Springs dominating another.  Likewise, see how all the ones in Washington are generally in easy driving distance of each other (the Tacoma one has bridges to Gig Harbor, across the Tacoma Narrows).  Even better, if you look at the nation as a whole, the Compactness w/ geopolitical boundaries map has about 37.5% more \"competitive districts\" than the current Status Quo (99 vs 72), and about 95.2% the number of competitive districts of the most competitive paradigm that wasn't *specifically gerrymandered* to achieve competitive districts.  > If the congressperson in Pasadena suddenly had to care about voters in east LA, is that not a good thing?   The problem isn't a congresscritter in Pasadena suddenly caring about voters in east LA, it's that cohesive communities would be subject to *algorithmic* cracking.  In other words, it's not that the Congresscritter would care about the voters in east LA, it's that if Pasadena gets \"cracked\" then there wouldn't be a congresscritter that cared about Pasadena.  Besides, while such algorithms make *algorithmic* sense, they don't make *sociological* sense.  The Shortest Split-line  would result in *numerous* cases where your next door neighbor, and the one across the street from you, would be in a different district than you are.  Hell, it's *possible* that the SSL would result in two halves of a duplex having two different congresscritters.  --- TL;DR: going to an algorithm is good, but unless your algorithm acknowledges political and sociological realities, the populace will always treat it as what it is: a pipedream, completely disconnected from reality."}

{"prompt": "[NJ] Amazon says I returned the wrong item and is threatening to charge me for it In June I brought a rather expensive drone for myself. It was just a little over $1000. When I received it, I noticed that it was missing one of the cables that was required to use the drone. I immediately requested a replacement on Amazon and returned the one with the missing cable. I returned it to a UPS store as advised on the Amazon return instructions. A few days later I received notice that the return was received and never heard anything of the issue again.   Fast forward two and a half months later and I receive an e-mail from Amazon that states that I returned the incorrect item and that I'll be charged if I don't return the right item. I know for a fact that I returned the right item, so I e-mailed back simply stating that I returned the correct item and asked them to provide proof that I returned the incorrect item.   I received another canned response back simply stating that I returned an incorrect item. I replied to the canned response with the same response, only this time I also cc'ed jeff@amazon.com which from my understanding forwards to some special inbox that gets more attention.   I called amazon customer support to get more information. Support told me that they could not give me more information and that all they could tell me is that they received the wrong item. They did take a report though where I explained again that I returned the item and the customer service rep stated that a special team was handling the case and that I wouldn't receive any more emails on the subject and that I wouldn't be charged. I wished I had recorded that phone call.  Later that day I receive another email from amazon, this time I think it's a reply to the email I cc'ed to jeff@amazon.com email, essentially stating the same thing that Amazon support had been stating. I asked them again to provide proof that I returned the wrong item and I asked that they return the incorrect item back to me if they cannot provide proof for whatever reason. I also pointed out that the Amazon website lists the return as completed and even lists that date (2 months ago) that the return was received by amazon on.  Again they responded similarly to their previous e-mails, stating that I returned the wrong item and that they were going to charge me for it. They said they could not provide proof and could not send the incorrect item back to me. They also said that they could not send me proof because they discarded the incorrect item that they claimed I sent them.   I called support back to get an explanation on the last e-mail I had just received and was again told the same thing as the first call, that a team would be back in contact with me within 24-48 hours via email and that I wouldn't be charged or should receive anymore e-mails requesting that I send the item back. Due to how inconsistent amazon has been up to this point, I started recording all of my calls. I also saved all of the emails I have up until now. I also took screen shots of the return order page that still shows the return as completed and received by amazon on June 24th.  I'm really at a loss for what to do here. I don't have the return shipping receipt anymore since it was so long ago and I received confirmation that they received the item. When I returned the item, amazon allows you to return the item in it's regular product box without a cardboard shipping box to a UPS store. I suspect that between the UPS store and the Amazon warehouse that someone stole or replaced the drone. However since Amazon won't give me ANY information, I have no way to confirm that.   It seems that every response I get back from Amazon on any of my requests for information is met with a \"fuck you, pay me.\" from amazon. I assume they're going to charge my card for the $1000 soon. It's an Amazon Store credit card by Synchrony bank, so I have no clue how a credit dispute would work out in this case. If they charge me, would it even be worth brining a company like Amazon to small claims court?

I called UPS and opened an investigation with them using the return tracking number. UPS completed their investigation but wouldn\u2019t tell me what their findings were and that I have to call Amazon to get that info. That was another frustrating loop. Eventually I got a UPS supervisor to confirm that they were waiting for paperwork from Amazon to send them payment for the iPhone, so I took that to mean UPS concluded it was their fault. With that supervisor on the phone, I three way called to Amazon, requested a US based supervisor, then had the UPS supervisor explain to Amazon what was going on. I then made sure that the Amazon supervisor included all that information in a note to the specialist team. I then replied to one of those specialist team emails, restating the conversation that just took place, confirming that UPS accepted liability.   They confirmed the refund via email later that day.  Overall, it was a colossal pain in the ass, especially since the tracking on it showed a scan weight that confirmed I didn\u2019t send an empty box, but finally it\u2019s resolved after a month of dealing with it.

{"prompt": "Is anybody buying equipment or baking ingredients before prices go up? With inflation kicking up (at least in the U.S.) I was just wondering what people were buying ahead of schedule to avoid future price increases.", "completion": "Nope.  At the start of the pandemic I bough some extra basic ingredients like flour, oil, yeast, and sugar.  I don't buy more than I can use before it expires, and I've been practicing first-in-first-out to keep everything fresh.  Every time I use a bag, I buy a new one and open the oldest bag remaining in my pantry.  The danger of buying is bulk is spoilage due to damage or bugs, and expiration.  Bugs coming from the store have been issues for me twice since the pandemic started.  To mitigate that, as soon as it comes in my door I put each unopened bag of flour in a 2-gallon ziplock bag and write the purchase and expiration dates in large numbers on the top of the bag.  This means that I can always see what's in date and if any one bag has flour mites or weevils from the store, it can't spread to the other bags.  Buying items with a medium shelf life like flour and oil can help manage brief stock shortages, but it's not a particularly effective strategy to address long term shortages or price increases.  You can only use a certain amount before it expires, and you're not saving money if you buy more than you can use.

{"prompt": "Change my view thatCapitalism is a better economic system than Socialism I will start my premise by saying that I believe capitalism is better than socialism due to the fact that it allows competition between different businesses. This is crucial to keep growing a stronger economy and helps goods become cheaper than they would be under a socialist government.   My problems with socialism (And I'll touch upon why I disagree with Bernie Sanders' \"Democratic Socialism after) are that the government wishes to control all industries and social services. This is rather worrisome to me because if the government is in charge of things like healthcare, tuition, and means of production, I don't think people will have the incentives to work as hard as they would in a competitive society. I also feel like coal would lose its use if the USA became socialist to preserve the environment. I personally like the use of coal, but that is another topic to discuss.  Now, to the closest socialism that we could've experienced around this time was if Bernie Sanders' had won the election and implemented his Democratic Socialism. The problem that I have with Democratic Socialism is that I believe it is in a contradiction with itself. I will cite information from a official Democratic Socialism website itself. I will take out the most relevant parts though in case you do not wish to read it.   The meaning of Democratic Socialism: >Democratic socialists believe that both the economy and society should be run democratically\u2014to meet public needs, not to make profits for a few.  So the way they intend to reach this goal is by: >Today, corporate executives who answer only to themselves and a few wealthy stockholders make basic economic decisions affecting millions of people. Resources are used to make money for capitalists rather than to meet human needs. We believe that the workers and consumers who are affected by economic institutions should own and control them.  The only way I can see this working is through hard government control, which is why I call it a contradiction.  I think capitalism is the best and some good examples are NASA and spaceX. Before, any relevant company pushing towards the knowledge of space and space travel was NASA and NASA only, but with the recent surge that spaceX is coming out with, I am sure that NASA will start kicking things up a notch. I believe science is very important in moving our society and economy.  Besides countries like Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, socialism has failed most of the times it is attempted to be implemented. I also have to disagree with the people who say that socialism is possible because countries like the ones listed above do it. I disagree with this because it is hard to compare a country like those to the USA because of factors like population, which I feel is the most important because it is easier to share wealth among less people. I also do not wish to pay higher taxes for government subsidy programs.     _____  > *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things.

Capitalism only breeds competition if it is regulated to - otherwise it does an incredibly good job at destroying it. All it takes is a company that is larger than its competitors to to buy out, price out or use any one of any number of tricks to put the competition out of business and become a monopoly with far too much power. Look at cable companies in the USA - look at the resources they have, and how they have engineered a situation that makes it effectively impossible for any competition to spring up in their areas.  Look at how the capitalist US healthcare system is run, and how expensive it is compared to countries with more socialist healthcare systems, like the NHS in the UK - free at the point of delivery. You don't have to declare bankruptcy if you happen to break your leg.  There is a false belief that competition means that companies will do what's best for the consumer. This is not, and has *never* been the case. Companies will do whatever makes their shareholders the most money - even if it isn't good for the consumer.

Aka, if you don\u2019t make 3x the rent of the area you want to live in, you\u2019re homeless.  So the answer is simple. A living wage is 3x the average rent of said area. Anything lower is poverty wage.", "completion": "Why should MINIMUM wage be tied to AVERAGE rent?  That's a statistical mismatch.  Now calculating minimum rent could be problematic, but something more suitable might be lower 10th percentile rent. Or better yet, use a bit more info and calculate how many households would be at minimum wage, then match that percentile with the rent percentile you compare to."}
{"prompt": "(Pilot) How does a wing physically create lift. It seems like depending on who you ask (namely other flight instructors) you\u2019ll get a slightly different answer. Bernoulli and Newton are always part of the explanation, but how their principles apply to creating lift are often different. I understand as pilots we don\u2019t need to have an aerospace engineer\u2019s mindset when it comes to this stuff, but I feel like there should be a universal understanding for how a plane flies. (Hopefully I don\u2019t butcher these concepts, I just want to understand).   Concept 1 (most popular): I\u2019m not saying this isn\u2019t correct, I just think it\u2019s incomplete. It doesn\u2019t mention anything about flow-turning. Basically, with Bernoulli, the curved upper surface acts as half of a Venturi causing the airflow on top to speed up and experience a reduction in pressure. Conversely, the bottom sees an increase in pressure. We know air moves from high pressure to low pressure so this must support the wing; lift. Newton: air hits and rebounds downward off of the bottom wing resulting in an opposite reaction upward; lift.   Concept 2 (Flow Turning): This theory suggests lift is created by accelerating a mass of air downward to create an equal and opposite reaction upward. This also uses both Bernoulli and Newton but applies them differently. A wing is not a Venturi, there\u2019s no other half above the wing to constrict the flow of air. Rather, the velocity/pressure of the air increases/decreases because of its displacement, not constriction. This theory suggests that Newton is involved as the accelerated air (Bernoulli) is forced downward along the top surface of the wing creating downwash such that this downward momentum creates an equal reaction upward; lift. It doesn\u2019t really mention anything about air bouncing off the bottom of the wing. Just that Bernoulli\u2019s principle accelerates air downward, and Newton\u2019s law says there must be an equal and opposite reaction to this.   My only concern is that while these two concepts end up in the same place it seems as though the principles are applied differently depending on who you ask.  Thanks!", "completion": "Oh boy someone's about to fuck around with the Navier-Stokes equation and boundary value problems and find out real fast that Bernoulli is just \"conservation of energy\" and Newton is just \"conservation of momentum\" and inviscid flow is for losers.  I gladly welcome you to the cult of \"wings are actually just magic\"."}

I am cooking the turkey for Friendsgiving this year and as a little fun gag we're doing a Minecraft theme where everything will be in cubes. I am trying to figure out a way to make the whole roasted turkey as square as possible without having to just shred the whole thing and then put it in a square mold. I'd like to keep the wings/legs intact, they are not necessary to also be square I think the body of the bird would be enough to get the point across. I was considering trying to shibari-style tie the Turkey (while raw) into a square and then cook but was unsure how effective that would be. Anybody have any experience shaping whole turkeys into non-turkey shapes?", "completion": "Go crazy.  Debone, separate the white and dark meats if you're into that, maybe mix in some flavorful aromatics, etc...then grab your meat glue, go to town, and sous vide it in a cube.

{"prompt": "[NY] UPS dumped around $10,000 worth of product infront of my store at 10pm on friday night (long after i was closed) over a week ago. My supplier is blaming UPS, UPS is blaming me and refusing to do anything. What can i do? I run a hobby shop in New York state. I have a supplier who i have worked with for years, who typically sends me my product via UPS.   UPS has been massively delayed due to COVID, i went from getting orders multiple times a week to basically almost nothing for the last 8 weeks. I had nearly a 100 packages sitting in UPS distribution center, some of them have been forever stuck in the state of \"Out for Delivery\" for weeks now, to things basically entering the black hole of the local distribution center weeks ago with no updates.   This hurt my business pretty bad (which was already suffering due to COVID) as a lot of this stuff was items people had ether pre-paid or waiting for me to get my hands on.   On June 26th when i was more or less in bed, i suddenly got a slew of delivery notifications from UPS around 10 pm. Since i live a good 45 minutes away from my store, i freaked out and by the time i managed to get there. The stuff delivered had been taken, i checked the CCTV for my store entrance and probably 10 minutes after UPS dumped the packages some people came by and picked up all the items and took off.   I made a police report and passed it along to UPS as they had completely screwed up. On Friday i got an update and UPS had closed all my claims stating that it was signed for. The signature was basically the word COVID. Which from my understanding is UPS not requiring signatures due to COVID.   The following blame is going around in a circle:  * My supplier is blaming UPS and how it isn't their fault, and tells me they fulfilled their obligation and i need to contact UPS.  * My supplier doesn't have anymore of some of the products, so i can't actually fulfill many peoples orders now.   * UPS is putting the blame on me stating that it was signed for and is refusing to discuss it more.

{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old: Competitive eating. How can people eat so much in one sitting? What happens to their stomachs and bodies after eating so much? And why does it seem that so many competitive eaters are very skinny?", "completion": "They are able to eat so much because they prepare. They stretch their stomachs, they practice techniques for speed, etc.   After a competition, it's not unlike how you feel after Thanksgiving. Full, sluggish, tired, maybe even a little nauseous. Just to a greater degree. Most of these people don't vomit after competition. Other than that, you recover pretty easily within a day.   It isn't necessarily that most competitive eaters are skinny so much that the successful ones tend to be. This is for several reasons. First, your stomach is (supposedly) better able to expand when you don't have shit tons of fat around it. Second, people who are fit burn more calories, so if you do a lot of competitions it benefits you to stay in shape for your health. Third, competitions are exhausting. It may seem like just aggressive eating, but it's tiring and if you aren't in shape it is hard to keep up aggressive activity for 10-12 minutes non-stop.

{"prompt": "CMV: Hamburgers and other sandwiches ordered at fast food restaurants should always be plain by default \u2014 toppings, sauces, and condiments should be by explicit request. Maybe I'm biased because I like my burgers plain, but this seems like a no-brainer to me for a whole list of reasons.  1. *It's simpler, for both the person making the order and the person taking the order.* As things are now, the person ordering a sandwich has to explicitly tell the employee the items on that specific sandwich they don't want, *and* any additional items they do want on it. This is a mix of addition and subtraction \u2014 you have to remember the things you want to add and the things you want to take off, which is a complication on both sides of the order. This added complexity makes it more likely for employees to make a mistake in filling the order. It also requires that the person ordering the sandwich have prior knowledge of all the toppings on that sandwich \u2014 or else they have to ask the employee, which takes up extra time for both the employee and the customer. The current method is both more time consuming and more prone to error.   2. *It will be faster, easier, and less costly to fix more of the errors that do occur.* If the default is plain, it's more likely that when errors do occur, it will be in the form of leaving off a topping or condiment that the customer has requested. This is fairly easy to fix by simply adding the topping or condiment to the existing sandwich. And, because the error does not consist of the presence of an item on the sandwich the customer dislikes, the customer will be more likely not to care and go with it as is with complaining. As things are now, most fast-food errors consist of a topping being on a sandwich that the customer did not want, which then requires that the sandwich be thrown out and a new one be made, costing the restaurant time and money, costing the customer time and frustration, and producing more waste.   3. *It encourages customer engagement and provides better service.* As things are now, it comes off as the restaurant telling the customer \"this is how you should have your sandwich.\" For one, this is somewhat patronizing, and even though special orders are taken, it makes them feel less welcomed and encouraged to some people. Furthermore \u2014 customers are more likely to know what sounds good to them in the moment. Encouraging customers to express what they want with each order encourages creative expression in their dining experience, and the result is not only a more psychologically satisfying experience, but food that is more likely to satisfy what the customer is craving at that moment. Better tasting food means more repeat trips to that fast food establishments by the customer. Yes, customers can make these special requests now \u2014 but if they are tired and feel it's going to be a bother they are less likely to, whereas if it were actively welcomed and encouraged they would be more likely to.   4. *It's accommodating to people with special needs.* Some people can't eat certain foods for religious or health reasons. Some people have food allergies and sensitivities (I'm aware that a severe food allergy would keep somebody from eating at a place that handled that food at all, but some people, like me, who have minor allergies or sensitivities, don't have to go to such an extreme). Some people have religious or cultural reasons they can't have certain combinations of food, like Orthodox Jews and cheese on their hamburgers, or Muslims and products derived from pigs. Some people are autistic and have sensory processing issues that make certain ordinary foods downright repulsive to them (which is why I tend to like my sandwiches with very few toppings, and cannot eat most condiments). Where a messed up order might simply make a meal a little less enjoyable for a typical person \u2014 for those of us who fall in any of the above categories, it can render the food completely inedible. In light of my points #1 and #2, this makes people with special needs feel more seen and valued as customers by that restaurant, which would in turn encourage their patronage of that restaurant.   5. *It would potentially save restaurants and customers money.* I'm putting this last because it would be dependent on the execution. But if toppings were optional and had to be explicitly ordered, companies could save themselves money on overuse of toppings by charging small amounts for these additional toppings. You simply lower the price a little on the sandwich itself, and list the toppings in their own section of the menu. This would, on one hand, mean that you wouldn't be wasting money on toppings that customers didn't really want \u2014 money being spent with zero or negative return in terms of customer satisfaction and profits. Charging a small nominal price for those toppings would discourage customers from loading down their sandwich in a way that wastes restaurant resources \u2014 while at the same time, giving them the freedom to add whatever they wanted, even doubling the amount of a particular topping, without loss of profits. This could also save customers money too \u2014 say, if a customer was short on cash, they could order a sandwich with no toppings for a lower price. They wouldn't be paying for things that they weren't getting. This makes good financial sense for everybody involved, while maximizing customer satisfaction.  The one downside I see to this is, for the more apathetic customer whose attitude is \"I don't care, just give me a burger with the usual stuff on it\", they would have to go to a bit more time and trouble to articulate their order than they might really want to do. This could be easily solved with some simple term that signals this, the same way we say \"plain\" now when ordering a sandwich with no toppings. The big difference is \u2014 if they forget to say this term, and end up getting a plain burger when that's not what they wanted, it can be quickly and easily fixed by adding the toppings, and they are less likely to care overall, just as I explained in point #2. But as things are now, if someone forgets to order a burger plain, they are stuck with an inedible sandwich, and it was \"their own fault\", so they have to go to the expense of ordering a whole new sandwich. So the single downside I see to this is already well exceeded by the equivalent downside of the current arrangement.  *Edit:* Formatting.", "completion": "Is this for all sandwiches or just the basic hamburger? For many sandwiches at fast food joints, like the big mac, the appeal is in all of the toppings that come with it. A big mac without the sauce and other toppings isnt a big mac.   I could see this making sense for just the plain hamburger. But beyond that the toppings are an important part to what defines each special sandwich."}

{"prompt": "How do you introduce rigor to PhD students ? There\u2019s always a tricky time to negotiate in a PhD thesis, in particular in physics, when the student has to understand that she/he is not in school anymore, and that his work should aim at professional standard, not homework quality.  I have the tendency to let the student settles in the environment for a while (there is already a lot to learn) and at the first paper/report, I correct it as a PhD thesis or a colleague\u2019s paper. This means that you can barely see through the red pen and the end, and even with the best sugar coating, it is not plaisant for the student.  In addition to be probably the worst of doing that, the problem is that with good student that had never failed anything, they don\u2019t understand.   I\u2019m not saying that I don\u2019t correct errors before, I\u2019m just not marking them as show stoppers to avoid blocking the student on some error propagation for example.

It annoyed me a fair amount as a student when I'd send a section to my advisor asking for structural and content comments, and I'd get back a ton of micro-edits.

I'm also only 70% sure that you're going to reject large portions of the text wholesale, so there's no point in *either of us* spending hours going over it with a fine-tooth comb correcting commas.  First establish story and structure.  Then run through the microcorrections.  Make it clear to the student that this is staged, and that there are two steps here -- but limit how much time is wasted correcting text that's going to get tossed out.  -----  E: this also has the interesting effect of meaning that the return with relatively little in the way of corrections is a lot of work (\"You need a paragraph about X\"), while the return with tons of corrections is relatively little work (30 ','s, 17 sentences to be merged, 4 uses of the word 'apparent' too close to each other, etc)  -----  E2: If it's *really* bad, only correct one section.  \"This is the level you should be working towards; go over the rest yourself and fix these things there too\".

{"prompt": "[US, FL] Random person sent me large amount of money on Zelle, they are now requesting I refund them. Unsure if this is a scam and how to proceed. I recently received a large amount of money through Zelle (for those that don\u2019t know, it\u2019s an app like paypal/venmo but through your bank) from a random person. I will try and keep details as vague as possible to protect my identity.  I immediately called my bank and told them that I did not request this money, and that I did not recognize the name of the person who made the transfer. They told me that they would begin the refund process, but that this could take weeks to resolve itself. For now, I would have to leave the money sitting in my account until the claim is settled, or I could be hit with an overdraft once it processes.   Immediately after, I began receiving calls and texts from two numbers. One person claiming to be the person who made the transfer, and the other the person who was supposed to receive it. They both gave me a similar story. The sender was the recipient\u2019s family member who was trying to send money. But because they were elderly and unfamiliar with the app, they sent the money to me instead (my phone number is one digit off of the intended recipient\u2019s). Both asked me to send the money back to them, explaining that they are in need of it quickly. I explained that I had already begun the refund process with my bank, and that unfortunately, it could take weeks to process. They have asked me to cancel the refund with my bank, and just transfer them back the money.   While both people have been nice and non-threatening through this situation, there have been some things that set off some red flags. This seems similar to scams I\u2019ve heard about in the past. Where if I were to return the money, they would then dispute the original transfer. Then not only would my account be reduced by the original amount sent to me, but also by the amount I sent back to them.   Some of the red flags so far:   \\- Their story seems like a typical \u201csob story\u201d to make me feel sympathetic and send them back the money.   \\- Shouldn\u2019t there have been some kind of confirmation before they sent me the money? I know in the past when I\u2019ve used apps like this, they always make me verify the last 4 digits of the phone number before I send money for the first time. Especially considering the amount involved.   \\- I told them that the claim was opened, but they want me to cancel and send them the money directly.   \\- At one point, they mentioned my name and address, and said that they lived in the area and wanted to meet up. Thankfully, the name and address they mentioned were not mine, but a person who used to have my phone number. Still, this freaked me out a bit that they were trying to look up my name and address.   Am I being paranoid? If this is real, then I obviously want to help them. But I think that going through the bank is the safest way for everyone involved. But this whole thing seems fishy to me, and while it\u2019s not a life-changing amount of money, I really can\u2019t afford to cover the loss if this does end up being a scam.   To make it more frustrating, because neither of them are customers with my bank, my bank will not confirm any details with these people that the refund is actually taking place. So, they could think that I might be trying to steal their money and scam them instead. Should I be prepared for them to file a police report?", "completion": "This is a scam. I cannot find the link now, but what these scammers do is send you funds from a stolen credit card. Then - in between the time they email you about their 'mistake' and the time you send it back - they change the credit card on their account back to their own, since the refund goes back to the card on file.

It's also good to use a lot of water while cooking it and then pour of the remaining water, once the rice is cooked, to further reduce the levels. It's is how rice is cooked in Indian cuisine.  It doesn't generally change the end texture in my experience but it does change cooking time, making it shorter. Jasmine rice and other short grain rice might get less starchy, but for larger grains it doesn't seem to make a difference."}
{"prompt": "What is the difference between Cajun cooking and Creole cooking?", "completion": "Cajun food comes from an area of Louisiana called Acadiana and is heavily influenced by French food culture. The settlers of Acadiana (Acadians) were originally from France and settled in what is now the Lafayette area. Creole food originates from New Orleans. Creole food is influenced by multiple food cultures including West African, Spanish, and French (among others). Here is a good article that describes the similarities and differences. https://www.thespruceeats.com/creole-vs-cajun-cooking-3052287"}

{"prompt": "[Sports Movies] What happens if the team winning at half time also gets a motivational speech equal in quality to that of the losing team? Is the losing team screwed or do speeches only work if you are losing?", "completion": "The team that was losing at half time comes back from a big deficit to make it a close game, but ultimately falls short. Then they will reflect on how even though they lost, they came farther than anyone expected to and earned people's respect. Could possibly include them \"winning\" off the field in some way. Classic example of this is Coach Carter."}
{"prompt": "I'm going to get an offer for my first full time job! What should I know? Hi all! I just got a call earlier today- a company wants to hire me & I feel so relieved!  &#x200B;  I'm still a little nervous- what should I expect from my first position? Also, do you guys have any tips for how to negotiate a good salary/compensation package? What salary/benefits should I expect or negotiate to? Also, there is always a small voice in the back of my head saying \"what if you don't like the job\"- have any of you heard that voice and how have you managed those thoughts?  &#x200B;  For context, I'm graduating with a Bachelors in Aerospace Engineering and the position is a software/avionics engineer. I'm happy to provide more context as needed!", "completion": "Something I learned way too late in my career, and that I heard *all* the time and got so sick of hearing... you are your own advocate. Nobody is going to hold your hand and show you how to do things, or act on your good ideas. I often found inefficiencies in processes and brought them up to management thinking they'd get the ball rolling, and I was so wrong. It would have been totally okay for me to take the initiative and do it myself, but I was too worried about stepping on someone else's toes, and expected that if management wanted me to work on improving it they'd assign it to me. Don't get stuck in your own head like I did.   If you don't like what you do, wait a couple years then pivot. I recently learned in a seminar it takes ~200% of someone's salary for a company to replace a person if they quit; because of that, companies are usually open to people changing positions within the company. If you're at a decently large company a move internally should be not only doable, but encouraged (when compared to leaving). If it's a small company, maybe you need to look elsewhere but you're certainly not stuck in your initial role forever."}
{"prompt": "In-laws want me to delay roasting turkey until Saturday. Advice please! Hi! My in-laws just called asking if I can delay Thanksgiving until Saturday because a bunch of family members are sick \ud83e\udd75  I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s possible for the turkey to last this long and need advice \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f  I bought a fresh 19.5 lbs turkey on Monday and followed the recipe for this apple cider brine. It says to brine for 2-3 days so I was planning on pulling it out today to sit/dry overnight in the fridge.  Do people suggest I leave it in the brine for the extra 2 days?  Or remove it from the brine and keep it in the fridge the extra 2 days? Or should I try freezing it for a day (I have a small chest freezer)? Or do I say screw it & roast the massive beast tomorrow for just my husband & toddler? \ud83e\udd2a  Help please! \ud83d\ude4f", "completion": "I have roasted turkey the day before Thanksgiving for the past 15 years. My family is spread out, and everyone wants me to make the turkey no matter who is hosting, so I know your turkey will be just fine if you roast it tomorrow as planned!  Make stock from the turkey carcass after you\u2019ve carved off the meat, and reserve that for Saturday. Refrigerate the turkey ( you can even freeze it!) and when you heat it in a roasting pan on Saturday, pour a generous amount of stock over the meat.  Use the rest of the stock to make gravy, and heat up your sides.    Seriously, it\u2019s SO MUCH LESS STRESS to have the turkey cooked before the actual feast day!"}
{"prompt": "Can I use roast chicken carcasses to make a stock? If I buy a whole cooked chicken from the supermarket and use the meat, can I use the carcass/bones/wingtips for a stock? Is there enough flavour and connective tissue to make it flavoursome and gelatinous?", "completion": "Yes, I make large batches of stock(I guess technically it is broth, I do not pick the carcass well so it includes much back meat and skin?) With 2-3 rotisserie chicken that I keep in a zip lock in the freezer.  I keep onion, shallot,  garlic, carrot, celery and herb trimmings/peelsin a separate bag to use for much of veg to flavor it as well.  I'll do a good 6 hour simmer and after it cools in the fridge it is almost like jello.  Fantastic mouthfeel compared to store bought."}
{"prompt": "Let's talk vanilla What's is you favorite vanilla to use in most desserts? Is there a brand or region you prefer? Paste, extract, or bean?", "completion": "I love Ugandan vanilla pods. I think they\u2019re very fragrant and tasty... I also have some bourbon & thick Tahitian pods.  I have beans, extract, paste & vanilla sugar.   I use the extract in cookies, cakes or recipes where there will be other ingredients gonna over power the vanilla.  I use the one from Costco.     I use my nielsen -Massey pastes & Mexican vanilla extract for butter cream, white ganache, vanilla cakes, sometimes for custards.    I use my beans when \u201cthe queen of England comes over\u201d \u263a\ufe0f mostly if I am making vanilla desserts like creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, vanilla tarts -petit gateaux, pastry cream if for myself\u2026.  The leftover pod goes to the vanilla sugar jar.   Vanilla sugar is  just for pastry creams & custards."}
{"prompt": "Wanting to make a chai-chocolate cake, advice for incorporating the chai flavor? My boyfriend asked for a chocolate cake for his birthday, but I want to make it a bit more fun and surprise him with one of this favorite flavors.   I've used these two chocolate cake recipes in the past:   https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/king-arthurs-original-cake-pan-cake-recipe  https://addapinch.com/the-best-chocolate-cake-recipe-ever/  I wasn't sure if the best way to incorporate the chai flavor would be to just add spices to the batter, or steep some tea in with my liquid (in that case I would use the Add A Pinch recipe).  I was also considering keeping the cake as plain chocolate and just using the chai buttercream frosting recipe from Sally's Baking Addiction https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/chai-latte-cupcakes/  What would be the best way to get a good amount of chai flavor that also isn't overwhelming?", "completion": "Soak in a chai syrup? Could also add a strong chai tea to the better as a lot of recipes add boiling water anyway for a more moist cake."}
{"prompt": "[Star Wars] If the Kaminoans had a cloning system, why the jedi didn't made a army of Yodas? Or why Sididous didn't made a army of Mauls to kill the jedi easier?", "completion": "Assuming it's now possible to clone Force users... remember who Sidious is. He's a power-hungry Sith who believes in the Rule of Two, but craves immortality. An army of powerful Force users is an army of people who are a threat to him. If he trains them in the Dark Side he has to assume that, sooner or later, each and every one of them will try to kill him, and in the meantime they're going to be trying to kill one another in order to establish themselves as **the** apprentice.  Watching one Maul seemed easy enough, but he still ended up as an outsider wildcard who repeatedly interfered with Sidious's plans. An army of them is basically a recipe to have everything fall apart. And Yoda would be even worse - a Yoda trained to use the Dark Side would absolutely have the potential to overthrow him."}
{"prompt": "I\u2019m being forced to declaw my cat Hey you guys. Recently my grandmother was diagnosed with kidney failure and had to stay in the hospital for 3 weeks for her kidneys to start back up. My grandparents asked that I move in with them to help out but I have a cat who is my absolute best friend. I\u2019ve had her for 2 years and we\u2019ve been inseparable. My grandparents agreed to having her move in with us. Recently they started to worry more and more about furniture being destroyed. They just told me that the only way to keep her with me is to declaw her front two paws. I am in shambles. I have always been against declawing.. do any you guys have declawed cats?
