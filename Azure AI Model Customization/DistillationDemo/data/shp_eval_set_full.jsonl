{"prompt": "How did Hitler become Hitler? I know my question seems very broad or even obvious but what I am trying to figure out is how Hitler convinced a nation that genocide was for the greater good? I know their was fear mixed into it but was there a social stigma already in place that made it possible for Nazi's to follow suit so easily? How does a single man convince a nation that genocide is not a big deal? How did Hitler do it?", "preferred": "Nazi education is often very lackluster because it focuses too much on Germany itself and too little on the actual mechanics behind Nazi ideology and fascism which can come about in pretty much any shape or form and in any country.  Probably the best description comes from the NSDAP member Carl Schmitt who describes how fascism works.  According to Schmitt, fascism works by creating order through an eternal enemy. So establishing a strong identity by fabricating an ever-present other. The fascist state must be in a constant state of war with the other. This war cannot ever be a metaphorical 'war of minds' or something but a very real, concrete war that speaks to the primitive fears of the people. Creating an atmosphere of constant fear for survival among the people is essential for the fascist state. This fear manifests in hate towards the other and cruelties being inflicted on the other which, in turn, provokes fears and violent reactions by the other which then provokes even more cruel reactions. Therefore a fascist state will always culminate in genocide and war and can never, ever be peaceful. Peace being the one constant normative goal of all political philosophy, fascism fails miserably in this most important aspect. And so it can never work. What the other was for the nazis you already guessed: The Jews. Today's nazis like to create more abstract ideas such as 'deep state' or other conspiracy theories but the mechanics work the same and we can see today that the fear is getting more and more real and guided towards actual people. But not only nazis can be fascist. Something that nobody really seems to understand is that ISIS and other islamic extremist groups are, for all intents and purposes, also fascist. Here the other are the kuffar. They capitalize on fear of the other by comitting atrocities which provokes violent reactions to justify more atrocities.  Additionally, the notion that Hitler was the only man responsible, putting everyone under some kind of diabolical spell is wrong. There were a lot of people who made Hitler what he was.", "rejected": "I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post this, as what I mention *is* the citation, but there's a documentary called Nazis - A Warning From History that I found when trying to answer this very question.  It covers Germany and the rise of the Nazi party, and is amazing. It answered a lot of questions for me, and has interviews with Nazis, collaborators, and victims (it's from 1997 so a lot of people were still alive).  While it's not a text based answer and is ripe for deletion, I beg the mods to leave it, it is an absolute must-see documentary series if you're interested in the rise of the Nazis."}
{"prompt": "Is the \"Danger Zone\" cumulative? So, as part of my weekly meal prep, I make a big container of spinach dip (frozen spinach, sour cream, ranch dip mix) or grab a big hummus tub to eat with chopped veggies as my office snacks for the week.   When I take the dip out, it's at room temperature for  20-30 minutes once or twice a day, for the week.   Does being in and out of the danger zone like that \"add up\" for lack of a better term?", "preferred": "While the other answers are correct, it\u2019s also a fairly conservative standard.  There\u2019s some lag time between things actually warming up and bacteria actually responding and increasing their growth rate.  It\u2019s also the temperature of the product that\u2019s relevant, not just the ambient temperature, in 20-30 minutes that product isn\u2019t likely reaching ambient temperature so the danger zone clock isn\u2019t ticking that whole time.  Also keep in mind that official guidelines assume a worst case scenario, like a product being held well inside the danger zone as opposed to just outside.  They also assume the product is a fairly ideal breeding ground for bacteria, something that\u2019s mostly sour cream isn\u2019t going to go bad at the same rate as something like a soup or stew.", "rejected": "Totally agree with everyone that it's cumulative in so much as the danger zone exists.... But the room temperature spoilage of both sour cream and humus is going to take a heck of a long time.  And if either go bad you're going to know long before it reaches your mouth. These are not dangerous foods."}
{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old: How intricate/detailed is sign language, especially where inflection and sarcasm are concerned?

In the US there are regional dialects of ASL.  Also American Sign Language is closer to French Sign Language than British Sign Language.  It all goes back to Laurent Clerc who was hired by Thomas Gallaudet to teach his deaf daughter and other children.", "rejected": "It\u2019s just as intricate and detailed as other languages, and has sarcasm, inflection, and pretty much all the other basic features of languages.

{"prompt": "What\u2019s stopping the water in lakes from seeping into the soil and \u2018disappearing\u2019? Thought about this question when I was watering some plants and the water got absorbed by the soil. What\u2019s keeping a body of water (e.g. in a lake) from being absorbed by the soil completely?", "preferred": "Because there\u2019s already water in the ground. If you were to dig down beside the lake you\u2019d hit saturated dirt at the same level as the surface of the lake. The level at which this occurs is the \u201cwater table.\u201d Water flows under ground and levels out so if you dig a hole and keep the hole open, it will fill with water up to the water table. We call those holes \u201cwells.\u201d      Of course nature is more complicated than that simple model, but that\u2019s basically it. Rivers can lose water to the surrounding ground as they flow or gain water. Perched aquifers above the surrounding water table can occur when there are pockets of impermeable material holding water like a bowl. Those impermeable layers are called \u201caquatards.\u201d If there is a lot of rain in an area the ground above the water table can be permanently saturated, but the water is moving downward to the water table. Coasts are more complicated when tides are involved.", "rejected": "The amount of water you\u2019re talking about in a Great Lake is massive. The amount of porous ground underneath is not enough to absorb it all. As you dig deeper the earth becomes rock. It\u2019s not all nice absorbing garden soil down to the core of the earth."}

{"prompt": "CMV: There are many positives to organized religion, and from my point of view the online left fails to see the benefits of it. How\u2019s it going guys. I\u2019m writing this from a place of good faith, so I would hope you respond as such. I\u2019m not religious, but I\u2019m extremely sympathetic to many religious peoples and groups. I think they are a force for good in America, and in many parts of the world.   I have a few points, just a few.  A: Community Organizing and Involvement B: Charity and Donation C: Common Morality   A: This is my biggest point, and it basically boils down to the idea of a central community building or area which can be shared and used for the will of the people. This has numerous benefits to the people, because the face to face human interaction of people who may disagree over politics, law, and the world can help make the situation much more amicable and respectful. People become less separated from each other because there is always a time of the week where you come together, sing songs, talk about life, and unite around something that are all parts of your life. This space can also be used for things unrelated to the church, such as picnics and clubs.  B: Religious organization all across the world, and specifically in America are some of the biggest givers. They donate in large amounts, to lots of different causes and people groups, no matter the time or situation. These donation aren\u2019t always related to faith either, and can range from helping your local homeless shelter to giving aid to Syrian refugees. This has demonstrably helped many people all over the world, and religious organizations are vital to thousands of non profits all across the globe. This isn\u2019t much of a arguable point, since you\u2019d be hard pressed to find someone who hates charity.   C: This is probably the main point you may disagree with, but I think a common sense of moralities is important for a society to function. Obviously they would have to follow the laws, but having act better because of some eternal force combing us all together is , I think, a good thing.   Common arguments against this are absolutely the bad religion has done before and arguable does today. But I would say that an influx of members to the church would actually be good because they would bring new more modern ideas of love and kindness, less excluding of homophobia and transphobia.

{"prompt": "CMV: It is morally wrong to allow a baby to be born with a serious mental/physical birth defect, and the more morally right option is to abort it. For the summer, I am working at a sleep over camp that hosts different events per week. This week is what is known as \u201cbridge camp\u201d which means it\u2019s for children with special needs. The primary affliction here is Down Syndrome, however there are also kids with autism, major OCD, cerebral palsy, and a handful of others. After watching these kids for a few days, it is incredibly obvious to see that they suffer. We\u2019ve had an incident where some silverware was dropped in the kitchen, and a child with a sensitivity to sound started to panic because of it. It took nearly half an hour for him to calm down, and he had to be separated from the other campers so he wouldn\u2019t worry anyone else. We also have a lake, and the children are allowed to swim in it (under intense supervision of course). All was going well until a girl felt something brush up against her leg, panicked, and started to push her helper camper under water in fear, trying to get out of the water. If a few other helpers didn\u2019t jump into action quickly, I\u2019m sure that helper would have drowned, due to the size of the special needs girl compared to her. While I agree all life is important, what right do people have to decide that someone needs to live their entire life this way? Fear and panic are absolutely no way to live a life, especially for someone that doesn\u2019t understand the world around them. I think that making the decision to force a child to live with something so damning is wrong, and it would be better to simply abort the fetus early, if the condition is known about. Otherwise you\u2019re cursing your child to suffer all throughout their lives.", "preferred": "Most people with Down Syndrome are happy and their quality of life is good. The examples you gave of suffering sound like severe autism, which isn't even diagnosable in the womb.", "rejected": "I also worked with mentally retarded children many, many years ago. I have the absolute opposite view from yours. All children panic and many adults have reacted out of blind fear and harmed others. People with Downs Syndrome are usually sweet, gentle, and loving people. They are capable of more cognition than you give them credit for. Though their lives are shorter, they appear to enjoy it. Their parents love them. They bring net happiness into the world, based on just my subjective opinion.  Similarly, if I found out tomorrow that my child had some horrible disease that would cause him to die after a year of suffering, I would still choose to bring him into the world. He is 100% the greatest source of personal happiness I have ever experienced. I am appalled by the idea of terminating him and disallowing him from experiencing the joy he has had so far.   Feelings like this complicate my pro-life stance too, in case you were wondering about moral consistency. I don't believe in abortion for myself personally, so I have taken extraordinary measures throughout my life to prevent accidental conception. I think every life is worth living EXCEPT in the rare case of a person who is (pretty objectively) a net source of evil in the world, which is a pretty small category including people like Ted Bundy and Adolf Hitler."}
{"prompt": "What is with everyone reducing sugar in recipes by HUGE amounts? Is this a regional difference in preference? This is a serious question, I am not trying to shame anyone here.   I live in the US, and apparently our desserts here are notorious for being very sweet, or even overly sweet. To me, it's \"normal sweet\", most of the time, but it seems that for most people from the UK or AU (where else?) are disgusted by this level of sweetness. So I am wondering why this is the case. Are desserts in these other countries not normally this sweet?   When I think of dessert, it's something that *should* be very sweet, but also eaten in small amounts, and enjoyed in moderation. Certainly not something you eat every day. So I also wonder if desserts are typically eaten more often in these other countries? Is it an everyday thing? Do you eat larger portions?  I'm really curious to hear from people that have experience with both US-based desserts, and UK-based desserts. I don't know anyone here in the US who has ever reduced sugar in recipes by huge amounts, or complained about something being overly sweet. I do realize this is also just personal preference for some people as well, but it mostly seems to be a regional thing to me, that is what I am really asking about it here.", "preferred": "I grew up with American desserts and couldn\u2019t get enough - vanilla cake with strawberry jam and American buttercream was my favorite.   The issue is that our diet (not just the US, but the US and Canada certainly are worse than many European countries when it comes to this) has a ton of added sugars, even in foods we wouldn\u2019t consider a dessert. Between that and soft drinks and sweet desserts, you build up a tolerance and it actually takes more sugar to taste equally sweet.   The game changer for me was when I was 13 I was training seriously for a swim competition, and removed all added sugars for about 3 months. I didn\u2019t cut out all carbs, but no dessert,  jams, honey, etc.   I had never realized how sweet berries were - even after about a week and a half, fruit tasted entirely different and like a dessert on its own. It takes surprisingly little time to recalibrate your taste buds, or at least begin to, and while I have not cut out sugar permanently, that was the beginning of understanding why other countries have desserts that are delicious but super subtle compared to the US variations.  As an example, I still love cake but I\u2019ll use a Swiss meringue buttercream with about 70% of the sugar it calls for. Honestly still pretty sweet, and some of my favorite recipes have almost no sugar, but at this point American buttercream tastes pretty much like powdered sugar by itself to me - just not palatable.", "rejected": "I'm American and always ate lots of sweet treats and desserts (for reference, I'm from the South, where the sweet tea is even sweeter than soda!). I lived in Europe for 5 years of my adult life and when I came back to the US, I was very surprised at how my tastes had reset. Desserts and treats I had originally loved in the US were now WAY too sweet for me, and I no longer enjoy them.   Someone commented that US desserts seem to rank sweetness/sugar above flavor, and I think that's spot on. I now reduce the sugar in most American recipes I make (for flavor rather than health reasons) and almost everyone who eats my stuff comments that they love how it's not as sweet as other desserts. I rely on ingredients like very good quality chocolate, quality vanilla, etc. to get flavor rather than adding sugar just to get sweetness.  None of this is to criticize sweet American desserts, but I do think, at least compared to typical European tastes, our sweets, desserts, etc. are much more sugary."}

{"prompt": "CMV: Banning people from social media for bigotry and misinformation only serves to exacerbate the echo chamber problem. Rules against hate speech on social media have mainly had the effect of distilling racists and conspiracy theorists onto alternative social media sites, like Gab, Ruqqus, and Parler.

I see this claim quite often on Reddit. It's usually coupled with the claim that keeping extremists on mainstream platform exposes them to more moderate views and somehow keeps them less extremist.   I've never seen any evidence provided for either claim. Do you have it?  > You shouldn't want them banned unless you think the recruitment problem outweighs the echo chamber problem.  Yes of course. Why would we want additional people stumbling across extremist content?", "rejected": "Banning people does continually reduces the membership to the echo chamber though. So let's say there are 1,000,000 racist of various degrees (eg. ignorant racists, brought up wrong racists, susceptible racists, tagalong racists, lazy racists etc). 10,000 are hardcore \"kill the other race if they can get away\" racists. Today the 10,000 puts time and effort and spreads the message through free and easily available social media. Left to their own devices, they convert more and more of the remaining 990,000 to get closer to their hardcore spectrum of racism.  As you put more and more barriers up, it gets harder and harder for the 10,000 to convert the remaining 990,000 because it gets more expensive and takes more effort for the rest of the 990,000 to receive the message. First the lazy racist goes, followed by the tagalong racist and the susceptible racist and so forth. This doesn't change the 10,000 hardcore trapped in their own little echo chamber, but it does make membershp and access to the echo chamber harder.  Just like there are continual forces making a person more racists, there are other forces making a person less racist. Racists don't have monolithic degrees of racism. Some are brought up in household of racists, then they go out to the world and interact with people of other race and realise the incorrectness of their beliefs. Others just need the constant barrage of racisit rhethoric to cease so they can start hearing different views and perspectives.  And here's the final kicker of my argument. This used to work. Post WW2, Germany went through an Allied Power driven denazisation effort. Did Nazist / Neo Nazist disappeared completely? of course not but they were driven underground. Today you have Neo Nazis in Germany, but also strong hate speech legislation hamstring them. Such legislation are supported by most of the German population. The resurgence of Neo Nazism occured when the denazisation efforts was loosen.  The Internet age created seemless easy way to circumvent efforts to control them. Social media accelerated this even more. Why not reverse this trend, we already know the effect of social media in spreading hate and misinformation, why not try reversing it as opposed to burdened by a vague sense of fairness?  Your CMV is ultimately proposing a hypothesis of what will happen, respectfully I'm providing you a historical experience that counters your hypothesis."}
{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old: How were ISP's able to \"pocket\" the $200 billion grant that was supposed to be dedicated toward fiber cable infrastructure?

Did the government really set up a handshake agreement over $200 billion?", "preferred": "Maybe you should go to the source:  I've written 3 books about this starting in 1998 -- and all of these appear to be related to the same threads -- over 2 decades.   Here's a free copy of the latest book, \"The Book of Broken Promises: $400 Billion Broadband Scandal & Free the Net\", which we put up a few weeks ago because few, if anyone actually bothered to read how the calculations were done. They were based on the telco's annual reports, state filings, etc.-- and the data is based on 20 years of documentation-- Bruce Kushnick http://irregulators.org/bookofbrokenpromises/  I've been tracking the telco deployments of fiber optics since 1991 when they were announced as something called the Information Superhighway. The plan was to have America be the first fiber optic country -- and each phone company went to their state commissions and legislatures and got tax breaks and rate increases to fund these 'utility' network upgrades that were supposed to replace the existing copper wires with fiber optics -- starting in 1992. And it was all a con. As a former senior telecom analyst (and the telcos my clients) i realized that they had submitted fraudulent cost models, and fabricated the deployment plans. The first book, 1998, laid out some of the history \"The Unauthorized Bio\" with foreword by Dr. Bob Metcalfe (co-inventor of Ethernet networking). I then released \"$200 Billion Broadband Scandal\" in 2005, which gave the details as by then more than 1/2 of America should have been completed -- but wasn't. And the mergers to make the companies larger were also supposed to bring broadband-- but didn't. I updated the book in 2015 \"The Book of Broken Promises $400 Billion broadband Scandal and Free the Net\", but realized that there were other scams along side this -- like manipulating the accounting.   We paid about 9 times for upgrades to fiber for home or schools and we got nothing to show for it -- about $4000-7000 per household (though it varies by state and telco). By 2017 it's over 1/2 trillion.   Finally, I note. These are not \"ISPs\"; they are state utility telecommunications companies that were able to take over the other businesses (like ISPs) thanks to the FCC under Mike Powell, now the head of the cable association. They got away with it because they could create a fake history that reporters and politicians kept repeating. No state has ever done a full audit of the monies collected in the name of broadband; no state ever went back and reduced rates or held the companies accountable. And no company ever 'outed' the other companies-- i.e., Verizon NJ never said that AT&T California didn't do the upgrades. --that's because they all did it, more or less. I do note that Verizon at least rolled out some fiber. AT&T pulled a bait and switch and deployed U-Verse over the aging copper wires (with a 'fiber node' within 1/2 mile from the location).   It's time to take them to court. period.

You can't\u200b require everyone that wants it gets it because there is that guy in Alaska that lives 500 miles from his closest neighbor. You can try to say 80% of people who ask can get it, but what happens for those that can't get it? They can't get it because they are not in XYZ's coverage area. But they are asking because they are in nobody's coverage area, so what company puts them down as a no when none applies, who do you blame for not expanding? That metric doesn't work either.  The problem is the only concrete stuff you can do is tell them where to spend it, if that's on \u201dinstalling fiber\" then that's what they'll spend it on. But ISPs are constantly installing fiber, in fact that may be spending billions a year just to replace existing fiber, if you tell them you'll pay for it they'll just stop paying for installing fiber and let you pay, the money saved can be given out to shareholders. That of course is equivalent to just giving the money away, but there wasn't anything that said they can't\u200b do that.  So really it's a very hard problem to define, there can be some requirements on it, but they can't be tough, and that makes it just about equal to giving it away. If the government wanted their money spent on expanding access to specific markets they would of been required to tell the ISPs exactly what they want built and then maintained ownership of it, the way the power company where I live works. But that's government run ISPs, and everyone seems to hate that idea."}
{"prompt": "Making Tacos for 20: scale? Just realized my family will need some assistance with an event for 20 people this weekend and we've decided to go the tacos route to get it going. We're thinking of getting ~ 3 pork butts and 3 chuck roasts to toss in the smoker all day.   There doesn't seem to be much in the way of guidelines for scaling up all the fixings and I was hoping some of the more knowledgable minds around here might be able to help. We're looking to make guacamole, pico de gallo, and potentially salsa verde for the tacos. As an ingredient list, that would require:   * onions * avocados  * cilantro  * tomatillos * serrano/jalapeno  * cherry tomatoes (pico) * limes   The problem is I have *no idea* how much of any of those things I will need to prepare these things at such a scale.

Can be made 1-2 days in advance.  should be made at least 4 hours in advance as it takes time to cool off.  Personally, I replace half the tomatillos with an equal number of campari tomatoes and make an all purpose salsa so i'm not stuck chopping veg for pico, but this is your menu, so up to you.  I'd probably go 8 avocado.  Finely chop 1/2 med white onion, 1-2 serrano, 1/2 bunch cilantro and juice of 1 lime for the guac. Salt to taste. Adjust the mix ins based on strength of the onion, pepper and lime. Can be made the morning of.  cover with plastic wrap and store in the fridge.  Avocados don't oxidize that fast and more lime juice won't slow the oxidation without taking over the flavor.

{"prompt": "Virginia- I sent a voice recorder to my daughters daycare and caught them hitting her and verbally abusing her on the recording....what are the laws around recording in my state ? My daughter is just shy of 2 years old and very verbal. She just started daycare in February and has always hated it and freaked out at drop offs. People kept telling me that was normal so I pushed through as I am a single working Mom and noticed her behavior was spiraling, more and more aggressive. Yelling, shaking her finger, hitting, pushing...I felt really uneasy but thought I was being paranoid as toddlers can be little buttholes but I decided to buy a recorder and send it to her daycare. I never expected to find anything. The recorder went on all day and within the first three hours there is a recording of the daycare teacher screaming at her to clean up, that she wont eat if she doesn't clean up, you can hear my sweet baby saying \"Okay Mimi!\" (what she called her teacher) so sweetly in the background. Then you hear 5 whacks/hits and my baby starts screaming and what sounds like her jerking my daughter. My daughter starts screaming for me and the teacher says \"Mommy aint coming, she aint coming to get you.\" etc Obviously I cannot SEE the hitting and while it sounded like a harsh \"spanking\" my daughter came home with a swollen eye.   &#x200B;  I haven't listened to more of the recording. I am livid, heartbroken, I feel as though I failed my daughter. I wanted to turn them into CPS, the Police, everywhere but now I am seeing that my initial recording may get me in more trouble than the lady hitting and berating children. Does anybody know the legality of the recording? Is my daughter the one party that is consenting? I am her mother can I consent for her?

{"prompt": "CMV: There should be no legal difference between American Citizens convicted of a felony who have completed their sentences and American Citizens who have not been convicted of a felony. Our allies abroad may not be aware of this, but Americans surely are: American citizenry exists in Four legally codified castes - felons, immigrants, Territorial Americans and Full Americans.   The only two legal differences between a documented immigrant and a Fully Incorporated American are that 1). If an immigrant commits a felony in America, they can be stripped of their citizenship and deported. 2). Is eligibility to run for the Presidency, which is also not what I'm here to discuss. The first applies to this conversation, the second does not.   Territorial Citizens are fully American citizens on Incorporated soil, but their own communities are not places in which they are fully eligible for federal representation.   The biggest difference in rights however, is between Americans convicted of felonies and Americans who have not been. The definition of a felony is vague in America and many misdemeanors are felonies...based upon the whims of the judge and former records (Jim Crow policies) - but effectively, these crimes, however they are defined in ones state, locality, or federally will leave an American struggling to get a job, unable to vote, often for the rest of their lives, unable to own a firearm (not here to discuss whether our 2nd Amendment Liberties fit in our modern society so would prefer if we kept that discussion to a minimal) and depending on the judge/state, various other requirements, like regular monitoring during \"probation,\" which is effectively a game of catch and release.   My stance is that limiting the rights and opportunities of people with felonies after their sentence (including probation) has been completed is immoral, arguably, tyrannical, and a relic of our enslavement culture, so we should reenfranchise, return gun rights to, and cease deportations of former citizens and limiting jobs available to convicted felons unless credible basis for a persistent threat to our election systems, the safety of others, or other institutions can be established (affiliation with a terrorist or international criminal organization, election meddling, etc...)

If a person preys on the vulnerable, why not limit their interactions with vulnerable people?   If the prison system was genuinely configured to deliver rehabilitation, and prisoners remained confined until they were found to be reformed, I could see an argument for fully restoring their freedoms immediately.

{"prompt": "Not sure if this the right place because it\u2019s not EXACTLY legal advice? But here goes: My dad is insane and I think me and my family may be in danger and we\u2019re not sure what our options are. So a brief rundown: the past 8 years my dad has had random spikes of psychotic behavior and it\u2019s gotten worse and worse over time. This year, and specifically the past few months, it has gotten worse exponentially. I\u2019m pretty sure he has an extreme case of paranoid schizophrenia and possibly other debilitations. There have been several times that police have come to our house because of calls related to his behavior, but without evidence for an obvious crime, there\u2019s never really been much success there. Especially since he seems to be able to flip off his craziness like a switch when police show up\u2014 then we end up looking like we made the whole thing up.   A little more background, his father fought in Vietnam and had exposure to Agent Orange (suspected, I don\u2019t know the specific details) and ended up becoming very violent and disconnected later in life. My father\u2019s oldest brother has also been diagnosed with schizophrenia and is currently in the state hospital for murdering their mother (my grandmother). My father\u2019s second oldest brother is currently in prison for attempted murder, which he had tried to convince my father to help him with. To put it bluntly: there is a family history of psychopathic tendencies and murder on my dad\u2019s side.  Lately, my father has been getting increasingly crazier. He says he sees spirits jumping in and out of animals and people, he calls it a gift from god. He\u2019s also been watching a lot of murder documentaries and has been making weird comments about murdering people. He told my mother that he needed to kill this guy he suspected of stalking my mother, or \u201cat least cut his legs off\u201d so he can\u2019t stalk her anymore. And then the other day he told my mother that the shows he\u2019s watching are making him want to attempt murder.

{"prompt": "Why aren't airplanes dimpled like golf balls? Golf balls have dimples to create air pockets, which reduces wind resistance. Wouldn't a dimpled plane be more aerodynamic?", "preferred": "There are two main components to aerodynamic drag: pressure drag and skin friction. Pressure drag is due to pressure differential between front of an object and its wake region (back of the object). Skin friction is due to drag between object surface and fluid molecules.   Due to shape of a sphere, large portion of golf ball's drag comes from size of the wake, or the pressure differential between front and back side of the ball. Turbulent flow (caused by the added dimples) inherently results in higher skin friction on the ball, but it also reduces the wake size for the ball significantly by delaying flow separation. So in the case of a ball, the reduction in wake more than makes up for the higher skin friction due to the dimple. Another factor often overlooked is spin of the ball. Golf balls (when hit correctly) all have back spin, so the Magnus effect comes into play and creates lift for the ball, allowing it to stay afloat longer. The dimpled surface allows longer flow adhesion over top of the ball compare to smooth ball, so it increases the Magnus effect for larger lift.   In the case of a plane, its shape is already aerodynamic, so the wake size has been minimized from its shape. ~~Creating turbulent flow across~~ Air flow across surface of planes is also mostly turbulent already, so adding dimple to its surface does not significantly reduce wake size. But it does increase skin friction, and result in overall higher drag.  Edited for better accuracy.", "rejected": "Dimples cause turbulent flow which allows the slipstream to adhere to the ball further along its profile, causing longer time til separation and a reduced low pressure zone behind the ball. Planes main source of drag is shear drag from the air flowing along the wings much like friction. Inducing turbulent flow over the wings would actually increase shear drag, as now those turbulent molecules are bouncing more off the wings surface in the boundary layer.    Drag the ball experiences is known as pressure drag or form drag."}

{"prompt": "CMV: Dating and finding a relationship is easier for the average woman compared to the average man Now, this isn't a post to bash women or how dating is easy for women. It's about how when you compare the experience of the average woman compared to the average man, it's easier for the woman to find dates and a relationship.  Let's start with an example from my personal life. Last year some friend of mine broke up. So far the woman has gone on multiple dates with three different dudes one after the other. Essentially when she decides that she doesn't like one guy she just moves on to the next one in less than a week. While my male friend hasn't had a single date so far and that's not due to a lack of trying. Now even though at the end of the day they are both still single, the women at least go on dates which mean she has a higher chance to find someone compared to the man who hasn't been on a single date.  This brings me to my first point. The average woman has a lot more options compared to the average man. I remember reading a survey that said that on average women are asked about 12 times a year compared to asking less than 1 guy out. And when we introduce online dating it gets even worse. On average a woman has a match rate of 30% while a man has 0.013%. This means that statistically, women have a lot more opportunities to meet the one compared to a man. More options are better than fewer options.  My second point comes down to the average dating strategy. The average woman is a lot more passive than a man, in the man is still the one doing the asking out and trying to impress the woman. This means that women have the option to just passively exist and they just pick and choose from their options. In addition to that, they always have the option of becoming proactive and going after the guys they want if they don't like their options. Compared that to the average guy whose only option is to actively go out looking for women and initiating stuff, since if he just stayed and waited for women to approach he will remain single.  And finally, there is the problem that till about the age of 54 there are just more men than women.", "preferred": "I contribute it to two factors working together; **(1) horniness** & **(2) objectification**. Firstly, let's make it clear that I am not making a claim that men are not more or less horny than women, just horniness in general. Secondly, men do not experience the bullshit that women have to go through due to their gender their whole life. This makes some men trivialize and act without sensitivity, which is *not* attractive.  **Horniness** \\+ **Objectification** = **A bad formula to get a girlfriend.**  **A bad formula to get a girlfriend** = **More men getting denied.**  **More men getting denied** = **More men trying to get with women.**  One could say that \"*women have more choice when it comes to picking men\"* but I'd argue that it isn't an abundance of choice, it's a lack of any good choices.", "rejected": "I would disagree based on the following thought.    The average women in the dating pool is now a millennial. However this would also apply to genx or genz   The majority of millennial women attend college and therefore prefer a mate who is also a college student/graduate.    Women outnumber men in college 60/40 (and have since like the 1970s), therefore men with a college degree will always be relatively scarce in the dating pool making finding a suitable mate more difficult for the average women.    This actually gets worse as they age. It's 60/40 (1.5:1) in college but as college educated women marry college educated men the ratio will fall to 40/20 (2:1), then to 30/10 (3:1), then to 25/5 (5:1).    This is obviously based on the underlying assumption that women want a mate of at least equal education, but these preferences are supported by evidence.

{"prompt": "Is community college good enough to become a pastry chef? The title says it all, I am a junior in high school and I want to become a pastry chef. Would the pastry and baking culinary arts be good enough at a community college?   In my state I can get 2 years free, which is long enough to get an associates at the local college in culinary arts. If there\u2019s any difference in the quality, I\u2019d like to know.", "preferred": "Short answer: yes  Long answer: some jobs don\u2019t need college.  It can help you get a leg up or make connections, but it isn\u2019t needed like most jobs where it is a liability if you don\u2019t have a degree or a certification showing you know the tools and procedures.  You can get a job as an assistant baker and work your way up to being a pastry chef.  It takes longer without college but you can still get there.  Community College is great.  It\u2019s cheap, sometimes free like in your case, and I\u2019ve found that Community Colleges are there to help you rather than there for your money.  I went for my business degree at my local Community College and loved it there; much more than CIA which I went to after for Baking and Pastry.  My Community College had a culinary program and very little baking courses.  I specifically wanted to own my own bakery so I knew I wanted to go and specifically get a baking degree so I\u2019m now $50,000 in debt, BUT own my own successful custom cake business at 24 years old.  My only regret is the debt.  If my Community College had a baking and pastry degree, I would have gone for that.  Going to a bigger, more expensive school gives you a higher chance at getting where you want to be faster, but you have the debt.  It\u2019s something you have to look at what you are willing to give for what you are going to receive.  Going to a Community College is a smart investment because it\u2019s less debt and you are still learning from professionals in your chosen field.  You may get passed up for other candidates when you first graduate, but in this field, experience matters more than degree.  You may get passed up for a pastry job and have to take a job as an assistant baker, but after some time as an assistant, you can reapply as a pastry chef somewhere and they are most likely going to choose you over a recent graduate from a baking and pastry school.  Experience shows you can do the hours, do the work, and want to expand your skillset by upgrading.  Getting a degree means you were in classes and learned how to use different techniques.  They don\u2019t always have the same long hours standing like the actual job.  Some of my classes we sat down for two hours to take notes after 5-6 hours of baking.  That doesn\u2019t happen in the real career.  Plus, colleges have become degree factories.  Not everyone that graduates actually should be in the field which is why they would rather take someone with experience over a degree.  I would recommend you go for the Community College  degree and try to work in a restaurant as either the pastry chef\u2019s assistant or as a prep cook and get cozy with the pastry chefs.  Let it be known you are interested in being a pastry chef in the future and want to learn as much as you can in the industry.  And a tip, when you are learning something from someone as their assistant, if they show you a technique and you\u2019ve seen it done other ways, only comment on it if you like their technique better.  You are there to learn from them and their method is how it goes in the kitchen until you are their equal.  Even when I graduated from CIA, I was a baker\u2019s assistant.  The head baker was self taught and an amazing person and baker.  Her method of piping royal icing was different than how I was taught and how I like to do it.  I did not say anything and wasn\u2019t planning on saying anything until she asked me if I learned another way while making conversation and I told her the truth and it ended up she learned from me.  HOWEVER, I would never correct someone above me without them asking me my opinion.  Sorry for the long comment, I hope this helped at least a little", "rejected": "I live in Portland and went to the now defunct Western Culinary/Le Cordon Bleu which focused on 300 year old traditional baking. I was already pretty good at cake decorating before I went and had a job decorating cakes while going to school. And upon graduation I realized it was the only thing I liked doing throughout school. And I was the only one of my class to get a job after pastry school that wasn't entry level. And all of my interviews completely ignored my school training and focused on my experience. Some even actively encouraged me to take it off my resume because it meant you had some book knowledge and no active workforce training.  Just across the river in Vancouver WA the community college has an amazing culinary program that teaches all sorts of modern applicable cooking/baking skills that I wish my school had taught instead of just rolling a million baguettes for a month straight.   The only person I know who benefitted from official culinary school was a girl who went right after high school and was still living at home, she didn't have to worry about bills or anything and could focus on work and getting a part time job at a bakery for experience. She then was able to run her own small business pretty much right after school because her aunt and uncle owned a restaurant that they let her bake out of (presumably for cheap or free). Her decorated cakes/cookies aren't that pretty but she's got a majorly helpful support system that she's utilized to her advantage.  All that to say, do a thorough study of your local community college's culinary program and if you can talk to some students in it or someone who's graduated from it, all the better. Also, go visit local bakeries and see about interviewing or just chatting with the owners and workers. Get yo research on!"}

{"prompt": "CMV: The Argument for Student Debt Cancellation is Ridiculous and Flawed I want to make an initial disclaimer that I absolutely agree that college is way too expensive in the US currently and something needs to be done about it, however I feel that proponents of student debt cancellation consistently put forward arguments that are unrealistic, hypocritical, and brazenly self-interested, while masquerading as public interest. I want to discuss a few of them.  &#x200B;  **1.** **It is unfair and predatory to target high school students with these loans when they don't know what they are getting into.**  I somewhat agree, but I also think the simplicity of this argument ignores some realities. The people that sign these student loans are legally adults, and should be held accountable for that. I get that they are facing societal pressures of people telling them to go to college, but as legal adults it is their responsibility to know what they are getting into. I would support increased education for high school students about loans and debt, but absolving an entire demographic segment from responsibility for their debt on the basis that \"they couldn't have known\" is frankly ridiculous and feels like a cop-out.; 18 year olds are legally able to join the military or buy a home. If we want to absolve 18 year olds of their student loan debt, we would need to have a much bigger conversation about whether 18 year olds can legally be considered adults at all.  &#x200B;  **2. Student loans should be dischargeable through bankruptcy**  Sounds good in theory, but this ignores a fundamental principle of how bankruptcy works. If a business declares bankruptcy or if you can't make payments on your house or car, the bank can seize the business's assets or your house or the car. But if you can't make student loan payments, the bank can't exactly seize your degree or education.  &#x200B;  **3. We should cancel student debt because it would spur economic activity**  I'm not sure whether more consumer spending is even what we need right now in the high-inflationary economic environment in the US, but in any case, the argument has been present in so many political debates in recent political history, where one side asks to be given more money/spending power with the assurance that this economic activity will translate to the rest of the population in some way (Trickle Down Economics anyone?). It has always sounded to me like pro-cancellation arguers are just asking to be given more spending power, while hiding behind an argument that it's actually for the public good. Furthermore, I feel that undermining the principle of how debt works in our society by outright cancelling such a large amount of it would have enormous economic consequences and this would would outweigh any potential economic benefit (i.e. the debt can only be cancelled if the US government agrees to assume all of it, which would be incredibly expensive, or if they just order it to be written off, in which case no lender would ever have faith in the future that they can lend money and be assured of getting it back; at the end of the day, someone has to pay). If the Fed or the government really wants to spur economic activity, they can do so through targeted economic policy like stimulus packages or interest rates that wouldn't be nearly as haphazard or dangerous.   &#x200B;  **4. People who have paid off their student loans that are critical of student debt cancellation for others are wrong**  I have seen this one a lot. People who have paid off their own loans are critical of student debt cancellation (IMO justifiably so),because they feel that they worked hard and sacrificed to pay off their loans and are now being penalized by missing out on a hypothetical debt cancellation bonus. The counter-argument often offered is that these people are being selfish and that this is the price of progress, and we can't just not take progressive action simply because some people may miss out. An example that I have actually seen put forward on Reddit is that: if we hypothetically invent a cure for cancer, we can't just not use the treatment on current cancer patients, even if people who have already died of cancer may have missed out on this new treatment; we have to strive to progress as a society and cannot cater to the \"bag-holders\" who may have missed the wagon. This doesn't make sense to me, and again seems incredibly self-interested. A more applicable analogy to the cancer example would be if tomorrow we cap annual tuition for college at $5k for all future generations and leave all current student debt holders as the proverbial bag-holders; doing this would immeasurably benefit future generations in a sustainable fashion and allow equitable access to education, but current student debt holders would be the ones stuck paying the \"price of progress\".   &#x200B;  My personal stance on this issue has always been that we should lower interest rates so that people can actually pay off the debt, and focus our valuable political capital on policy action that tries to regulate or lower college tuition costs and expand access to college through these lowered costs, rather than cancelling student debt, which to me feels like a Band-Aid post-factum solution that doesn't address the root cause. I would love to hear what everyone else thinks!", "preferred": "In your first point, the argument says \"X is *unfair*\", and your entire counterargument is \"But X is *legal\".*  This is entirely missing the point of the argument. Yes, everybody knows the entire process of getting people to sign up to student loans was legal. The point is not that it was illegal, but that it was unfair.   Saying something should not be changed *because it is legal* is, in large part, absurd. The entire question of \"should this law be changed\" is the question of whether we should change the legality of something. Countering any such question by saying \"but it is legal\" is an empty argument.", "rejected": ">I somewhat agree, but I also think the simplicity of this argument ignores some realities.

You don't even trust them to drink beer. The reason quoted for that is usually that their brains are still developing. How can you expect them to make life altering decisions if you don't even trust them to drink beer for that reason? Very obviously they are *not* fully considered as adults. There's definitely a case of \"some of us are more equal than the rest\" case going on, and it's entirely arbitrary.   >A more applicable analogy to the cancer example would be if tomorrow we cap annual tuition for college at $5k for all future generations and leave all current student debt holders as the proverbial bag-holders;  No, this is just moving the goalposts."}

By all means bring it up to your manager if you have a good working relationship, but don't expect anything to come out of it. Raises no longer exist in the modern corporate world. If you want more than 1-3%, you have to find a new job."}

{"prompt": "[DC] Batman Beyond (Terry McGinnis) lives on Earth 12, which supposedly is the near future of Prime Earth. In Bendis\u2019 Legion of Superheroes run, Terry is shown to exist in Prime Earth\u2019s future. How is Earth 12 a separate universe if it\u2019s literally just the future of Prime Earth? Sorry, that title wasn\u2019t very concise. What I\u2019m wondering is how Earth 12 could be considered an entirely separate, alternate universe if it\u2019s just Prime Earth in about 40 years. That\u2019s just the future, not an alternate history or fundamentally different reality. Is it just that Earth 12\u2019s universe is about 40 years older than Prime Earth, so their \u201cclock\u201d runs a few decades ahead of time? Even that doesn\u2019t seem like a good justification for E12 being an alternate universe.", "preferred": "The assumption that the DCAU was not substantially different from regular DC is a false one. Those timelines are incredibly divergent in many crucial ways, not just aesthetically. People being alive or dead, marrying others or not, destroying cities or not, killing villains or not, etc.  Either way though, the meta answer is that there's no consistency between these stories, and different writers have different levels of familiarity with each other's work. Different writers also care less.   However, the *in-universe* answer is that time is convoluted, and there is more than one Terry McGinnis and his neo-dystopian Justice League Beyond. There is more than one Batman Beyond, more than one possible Prime Earth future, and even more than one Beyond continuity that we've seen -- Future's End was all about *a* Batman Beyond coming to the present, even if at the time it was... you know, *the* Batman Beyond.  It's weird and vague, but just imagine that Terry is an archetype of a future that might come to be. Most Terries are going through slightly different versions of adventures, and most are known to share experiences because that's just how that reality works. You can kind of assume every Superman has gone through an X number of events until a certain branching point.   For instance, there was a Batman Beyond that had a Robin. There was another that didn't. There was one that died, there was another that didn't. These are real comics and episodes you can look into. They are definitely *happened*, just to different Terries.", "rejected": "If there are infinite universes then, for example, there could be a universe where all that\u2019s changed is that a complete stranger blinked at a different speed once. Alternate universes are complicated and it would take someone a lot smarter than me to explain it, but the way I understand it time could be different in a different universe, just like Gotham by Gaslight is set in the Victorian era. I don\u2019t think other universes are connected to the same passage of time as the main DC universe so that\u2019s why they are further into the future on that earth. That\u2019s what I think anyway."}

All but one were in academia. Below are narratives of how the ones that worked out came to be.  I received one interview that stayed an interview, four offers, and two invitations to apply. I started sending applications in the beginning of March last year, and received my first interest at the end of that month. I accepted my offer in August. Of the 60 cold emails, I only had about 10 responses. The ones that weren't immediately \"no/no funding\" are below.  My interview happened at the end of the month. A collaborator who didn't do what we did was curious after I emailed him, and we talked. He didn't have any positions, but seemed pleased I thought of him and we parted, promising to keep in contact as things evolved.  First invitation to apply: International facility, well known in my field, with a yearly competitive program for international hires. Did not advance past second round.   First offer: In response to an industry email, I was curious and submitted my resume. First was a phone interview, then Skype, then I flew to their research facility and had a long day of meeting folks. I absolutely loved the location and the folks I met around town. I decided that the work wouldn't make me happy, and declined after a week of consideration, despite the location. This was possible because...  Second offer: A nearby (8 hour drive) R1 University with two groups interested in me both had interest. I knew one group through competition and one of their postdocs visited our lab a few months prior. The other had a postdoc reach out to me at a national conference after a talk I gave. I had phone calls with them and visited both groups over a 3 day weekend. After receiving their offer, I declined the industry job, because I knew I had a better fit for me. This job was more engineering and less experimental than I liked, though, so a couple weeks later I declined after ...  Third offer: The one I ended up taking. An R1 across the country. The PI of this group is **very** well known, and has a nearly fifty year career. He visited my grad PI's group, and I asked if he had a postdoc available, and he said he had two. So I applied. This group is much more in line with my long term career objectives. As a bonus, it was near the industry job location. Of the job offers I received, it paid by far the least on a cost-of-living perspective, but it was still enough, because it gets me where I want and wasn't \"paying for my happiness.\" I held off on committing for three weeks after interviewing in person, because...  Fourth offer: A national lab job. An alumnus of the department came back and gave a talk on opportunities at that lab. I looked around and found an open tangentially-related position, emailed the guy, and had a phone interview. While I wasn't a great fit for him, he knew a guy who was always looking, and sent my resume over. After another round of interviews with the other guy and his team, I flew out and interviewed in person. This job was really appealing to me for a lot of reasons, and I really agonized over my decision to not take it. I am thrilled I chose the third offer, but I wish I could have taken both.  Second invitation: After I had accepted the third job, over four months after sending an email, I heard back from another international facility that I was invited to apply with a proposal for research. I had to decline."}

I'm an assistant professor of astrophysics at the University of Kansas. I search for supermassive black holes, particularly in the distant universe (lookback times of 7-12 billion years ago), in order to figure out what effect these hidden monsters are having on their host galaxies. Most of my work has been centered around developing techniques to find supermassive black holes that aren't very active-their host galaxies are still in the prime of star formation.  Recently, I stumbled across the opposite scenario. I found a population of the most active supermassive black holes out there. These black holes are so active that we normally would not expect their host galaxies to be intact and forming lots of stars... and yet, they are! I coined this population \"cold quasars\" due to the amount of cold gas and dust they have.

Even weak solutions of dawn outperformed solutions of Walmart/Aldi/etc.. soaps using 5 times as much.", "rejected": "Probably the ingredients like surfactants or enzymes used vary from brand to brand and price point. Pretty sure Tide uses a custom made enzyme in theirs. They probably also formulate to do things like have great dirt pick up and leave minimal residue. you wouldn't want to leave behind residue that could be an irritant either so you probably have to use ingredients that are safe for skin contact.

{"prompt": "How to help a friend struggling to swim in the deep end of academia? Buckle up, this requires a lot of background. My friend Hanna is in her mid-thirties. We met in graduate engineering school, were TAs for the same class and became close friends over time. I am not and have never really been in academia - got my MS and peaced out to industry. I'm struggling to understand how to help her because of my lack of knowledge.  She seems to become unhappier the more she sticks around academia, but is determined to stay in academia. Her dad was a professor and she loves teaching - whenever she used to come back from office hours, her eyes would just light up with joy. She'd always get the best, most ridiculous ratings on our TA reviews by the students.  She took about 6 years to finish her engineering PhD at a top university. Her advisor seemed a bit strange (rambled a lot, was disorganized, took three years to even read her second paper). If that person was my boss, I would have moved jobs because it seemed stressful and there was a lot of agonizing over things maybe not in her control? She had a fair number of papers when she graduated (3 with 1 more in process). She never seemed super happy writing papers and did not bug her professor as much as I would have for not reading her 1 paper.  She got a post-doc at another very good university. 6 months in and she was unhappy again. Similar to her first professor, this advisor seemed to ramble a lot, work odd hours. At least she got another paper published? But she would call being very stressed or unhappy about how things were running so I suggested maybe this post-doc wasn't the right fit. There was no teaching associated with this role.  She got another post-doc, this time at a top university. She gave the other professor 5 months notice that she was leaving. She was promised the ability to work on the research she wanted to work on. The new professor seemed very nice and from what she described, seemed to have more structure than the last two.   Well, it's been almost a year, and she is still very unhappy. I visited recently - and it just happened that her lab was going out to lunch so I joined - and the professor (her advisor) seems more chill (but still very rambly) but very oddly unprofessional? The professor spent most of lunch talking more than everyone else, and complaining to the lab manager about a small part of his job.  Hanna did not get what she promised from her advisor - she has not gotten to work on any of the projects she wanted to. That said, I know Hanna. She dislikes writing grants and I think might let opportunities like that slide by (or she certainly doesn't search them out). I also know that she's not super forceful in trying to communicate what she wants to work on, and she hasn't made specific plans to get there. I wish I could she say she was happy going with the flow - but she is specifically unhappy jumping on every odd task the advisor asks her to do. And there's no teaching.  And she will not quit. She's told me she's not sleeping well, and while she sat at her at-home desk when I visited for 8 hours, at least 2.5 of those hours were spent surfing the web or looking at youtube. She has mentioned being depressed (we don't really talk about specifics) but I know she's in therapy once a week.  She took one of these figure-out-what-you-want career paths with my and other friends' encouragement, and I desperately hoped this was it, she'd figure out that academia is making her unhappy and decide to do something else (probably teach?). Instead, she decided working at a smaller university with less research and more teaching is what she wanted to do.  I really want to support her. I've put together lists of universities she can look at, have offered to help review her research and teaching statements, and have tried nudging her to come up with a timeline for completing materials. She hasn't done the timeline thing. She never does. She has done some informational interviews, which I think is good. I've tried to encourage her to do some of these outside of academia - she's done a few, but frustratingly just with previous lab mates.  She also doesn't network. In my industry, that's just about the most important thing you can do. She is very introverted, and covid definitely hasn't helped get her going to events and just meeting other people in academia. I've tried to push her to do this, but she doesn't budge.  I've been very critical of Hanna here, but she is brilliant (like was valedictorian of undergrad and got almost perfect 4.0 in grad school), very caring and thoughtful, and I think is an amazing teacher. She is not the most organized and for some reason will not put things on a calendar to go do. She does not like writing grants, is on the fence about papers, and enjoys talking to the people she is close to and that's about it. Judging from all of her advisors who I could not stomach working for, I don't think she's great at judging character.  She seems more unhappy now than she has in a while (probably about as unhappy as she was when she changed post-docs). She thinks she needs to stay in her current post-doc another year while she applies to positions at small universities. I'm really worried about her - I know a job you despise can make your life miserable and lead to depression. She may already be there. I want to help her.  -Should I push her to leave academia? -Should I continue to push her to get on top of the small university applications? -Does she really need to stay at this post-doc another year if she wants to pursue an faculty position? -Would it really be the end of her academic career if she took an industry job for the next year? -What should I be doing to support her? -What advice do you have for her that I should pass along?", "preferred": "I think your friend tells you this stuff because she wants to vent, not because she wants you to solve her problems. As someone outside of academia, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re capable of solving her problems.  So just listen and be empathetic.", "rejected": "> She has mentioned being depressed (we don't really talk about specifics) but I know she's in therapy once a week.  Your well intended interventions may be undermining the work she's doing with her therapist. Make it clear what kind of professional and personal support you have to offer ***if she asks*** and then take a step back and, as others have suggested, be her friend.  If there is a moment where she seems especially down, be exceptionally careful with what you say. If you are able, you could express empathy and maybe say something that will prompt her to remember what her therapist may have said about similar situations. To be clear, what the therapist is not your business. If you are a good friend, you are interested only if Hannah wants to share the information. The task for you is to remind Hannah to remind herself.  If Hannah were here, I would suggest directly (and not through a third party) that she keep doing the work with her therapist. If the rapport isn't where she'd like it to be, she could/should say so in a session and center some of the work around improving trust. If it becomes evident that rapport isn't going to improve, it may be appropriate to find another person to work with."}

So, I've recently started drinking to cope with the anxiety and stress. This is not a road I want to go down, though, especially since I have no illusions that it'd somehow help me overcome the demands of grad school and finish my degree.  Have you had similar experiences during your own life in higher ed, and how did you manage to climb out of the proverbial hole?", "preferred": "This resonates my friend. I didn\u2019t realize how much my drinking was taking over my entire life. It no doubt affects my health and really clearly began impacting my productivity.  Today was my first day without destructive drinking in several weeks. I never expected to get myself in this situation. Today the anxiety was brutal. I managed to get a bit of work done but I\u2019m already behind in the program.  Sorry I don\u2019t have advice. It\u2019s just odd timing for you to post this compared to my own struggles.

I went to counselling at my uni and have been in therapy ever since, as well as a bit later visiting a psychiatrist for diagnosis (ADHD and anxiety) and medication. It's been over a year and things are on average much better than they were, but there's still a long way I'd like to go, and I'm still having bad days/weeks (but not usually months any more!). My supervisor has been partly included where I felt it was needed, and I take semi-regular mental health days as needed. Therapy, as well as counselling for the actual life skills needed for daily functioning and PhD work, have both helped me a lot.  I'd encourage anyone who was struggling to reach out, either to uni services, any student support groups, therapy, or see a medical doctor. Postgrad is hard enough as it is. I think having some close people to be open to is great if you have that (unfortunately I don't have a great support network, beyond my boyfriend and dog), but I know I never could have done it alone and without professional help and support.   I was also on the start of a slippery slope with alcohol, but it got banned during our first pandemic lockdown so I decided to not stock up, and have barely touched it since. How much I relied on it scared me but I know I wouldn't have been able to tone it down by myself (without the lockdown alcohol ban). I've weaned myself over to some fancy (non-alcoholic) drinks that I can drink in the same parts of my routine that I'd have gone for alcohol. Weirdly it's working. But anyhow, I know a little of how you feel, and it's something that you can 100% find some help, advice and support for! This isn't something you need to figure out alone."}

Our goal is to cover the most pressing issues affecting autistic adults, from emerging adulthood to later life. I am particularly excited about including autistic adults in our new journal - as editorial board members, authors, reviewers and readers. As a doctor and a services researcher, my own research is focused on how people on the autism spectrum can get better access to health care services.

He was not given the rank of master because he hadn't, in the council's opinion, earned it yet. One of the central requirements of being a Jedi Master is successfully training a Padawan to Knighthood, and since Ahsoka had chosen to leave the order and find her own path, it was the Council's opinion that Anakin had not yet technically done that-- even though only a few weeks before they'd been willing to consider Ahsoka's literal trial for treason to be a sufficient spiritual trial to make her worthy of graduating (which was one of the reasons Anakin was so pissed off about it.)", "rejected": "Anakin was given a seat on the Council because of Palpatine pressuring the Jedis to do it.

{"prompt": "I\u2019m being forced to declaw my cat Hey you guys. Recently my grandmother was diagnosed with kidney failure and had to stay in the hospital for 3 weeks for her kidneys to start back up. My grandparents asked that I move in with them to help out but I have a cat who is my absolute best friend. I\u2019ve had her for 2 years and we\u2019ve been inseparable. My grandparents agreed to having her move in with us. Recently they started to worry more and more about furniture being destroyed. They just told me that the only way to keep her with me is to declaw her front two paws. I am in shambles. I have always been against declawing.. do any you guys have declawed cats? Do they change afterwards? I just really need some guidance. When they told me I had to do this I immediately went to the bathroom and bawled my eyes out. Lala is my bestfriend and I don\u2019t want her to be in pain.", "preferred": "Declawing is not the answer. It\u2019s entirely possible that, like many people, your grandparents don\u2019t understand the severity of the procedure or the common repercussions. MANY people mistakenly think that declawing is just removing or cutting off the nails, and that a cat will be good as new. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s an AMPUTATION of the last bone in each toe. Feel your fingers - it would be like amputating the last bone that you feel that starts right above your fingernail. It\u2019s barbaric, it\u2019s outdated, and many cats suffer life long issues because of it. Many people who have declawed cats will say that their cats were not negatively affected by it, but they just don\u2019t notice the subtle signs.   Declawed cats are more likely to BITE (and a cat bite is almost always worse that a scratch)  They are prone to early onset arthritis, because being digitigrade animas (animals who walk on their toes), amputating that last joint shifts their weight back onto their big paw pad, which changes their stance, which leads to chronic back and joint pain.  Declawed cats often suffer litter box aversion. How will your grandparents like it when the cat starts peeing or pooping on the rug?  Declawing isn\u2019t always straightforward, and complications can arise with the healing process, or even years down the road. I\u2019ve seen cases where the process was done incompletely, and a nail began to grow again, under the skin until it eventually pierced the skin.  Because declawing is NOT the answer to stopping or preventing a cat from scratching, and it is cruel and barbaric, many veterinarians no longer perform this service (in my 10+ years as a veterinary nurse, the only doctors I\u2019ve known who would do it were in their 60s/70s and ready to retire. NONE of the young vets would do it). And, in many countries it\u2019s illegal, and in parts of the US as well.   For people who argue that declawing keeps a cat from being surrendered to a shelter, I implore you to work a few months in a shelter and keep a tally on how many declawed cats are surrendered due to house soiling, biting, early arthritis, or other behavioral complications.   Please find some literature and share it with your grandparents. The Paw Project has a lot of resources. Also, you can cover furniture with blankets (that\u2019s what I do). They also make adhesive that doesn\u2019t hurt fabric that you can put on the corners of furniture that prevents a cat from causing damage (it\u2019s called Sticky Paws). You can also provide appropriate areas for the cat to scratch, like various scratchers, and reward her for using them. You can also apply nail caps. Less ideal, but you can confine the cat to certain areas of the house.", "rejected": "Absolutely do not agree to this. If you were moving in with a kid and they asked you to chop their hands off so that they don't draw on the walls, would you be considering it?

{"prompt": "CMV: It should not matter if being gay is a choice or the way someone is born. The choice of whom to love is a personal one and, as such, should be respected. I find that the political correct consensus is to assume that some people are born gay. And, therefore, they should not be forced to change. While I see in this an important step towards the acceptance of homosexuality, I also see it as a quite limiting view. In a sense, it equates sexual preference to a \u201ccondition\u201d that some people have  On the other hand, I feel that the idea of assuming that some people choose to be gay is almost universally condemned.  The way I see it, it really should not matter. However two (or more) consenting adults decide to explore their sexuality is a matter that concern them, and them only.

But I do feel bi-erasure should be brought up somewhere in this thread - my partner's bi, and they're saddened by the the portrayal in the media of bisexual celebrities: \"such-and-such a person used to be straight, then decided they were gay, now they think they're straight again?\" When in fact the person in question has openly said they're bisexual all along.   Also vaguely relevant is this fascinating blog post which mentions a gay conservative christian who simply *didn't realise straight people exist* - they saw gay people as weak willed pleasure seekers who had given into temptation, because to them homosexuality seemed very appealing and tempting, and they assumed that everyone else felt the same way. As such, they did think homosexuality was a choice - a choice in the same category as adultery or drug abuse, where you do something you know is sinful becsuse it feels good.", "rejected": "The reason for this distinction comes from what is legal to discriminate against. For instance, I can't change the color of my skin, so no one should discriminate against me for that. However, if I don't trust people that wear brown shoes, it is perfectly fine for me to deny service to people that wear brown shoes.  Religion is a bit more tricky because it does seem to be a choice, but some might argue that it is inherently part of one's soul. Plus, it's in the constitution.   One is free to discriminate based on many things that are changeable or the result of personal choice. No shoes, no shirt, no service."}
{"prompt": "Possibly overdosed on a MAOI. Having amphetamine-like effects 24/7 now + severe tachycardia&hypertension when eating chocolate - what should I do? **TL;DR:** A study said ethanolic Garlic Extract is a MAOI, I started eating 6-7 cloves of garlic daily for this effect (today is day 8). On days 3 and 5 I ate chocolate, and both times my heart rate shot up to ~130 BPM and blood pressure to ~150/85. Past few days, I've been feeling a 24/7 amphetamine-like drug high - focus, irritability, heart palpitations, high resting heart rate (85-90 BPM). Last time I ate Garlic was 24 hours ago, yet I still experience these symptoms. I fear that the MAOIs in garlic are irreversible - if so, could it possibly take 2-3 weeks for my symptoms to resolve (until new MAO enzymes are made)? What is the appropriate treatment until symptoms resolve? (Been taking Oxazepam after the chocolate-tachycardia, but can't take it daily because of withdrawal concerns).  ****  Age: 24  Sex: Male  I have been reading a study saying garlic has antidepressant effects in rats, and that it works by MAO inhibition, with comparable potency to the clinical MAOI Imipramine. Because of this, I proceeded to eat 6-7 cloves of raw garlic daily for 1 week, for the antidepressant effects.  I did feel stimulant-like, mild-antidepressant effects already on the first day, so I kept eating such amounts of garlic for a week. However, on Day 3, I had an incident where I ate chocolate, and got a mild version of \"hypertensive crisis\" - my heart rate shot up to 134 BPM, my blood pressure to 148/86 (my usual: 100/60). I immediately took 20mg oral Oxazepam and my vitals normalized. I didn't link it to the garlic, and so on Day 5, I ate chocolate and the same thing happened again, and Oxazepam helped me again.   Today I finally made the connection. The last time I ate garlic was 24 hours ago. Looking back, I realize that in the past few days, I've had pronounced amphetamine-like effects that lasted the entire day, every day, for at least 3-4 days. Focus, irritability, heart palpitations/\"flutters\", high resting heart rate - most of the effects. I took Adderall in the past, and I currently feel very similar to how the Adderall made me feel.  This makes me very concerned. My high resting heart rate (85-90 BPM) gives me a lot of discomfort, and the palpitations are worrying. Since I know many MAOIs can be irreversible, my biggest fear is that the MAOIs in garlic are also irreversible. In this case, does it mean it will take a few weeks for my symptoms to resolve?

Four spoke wheels have an 80-90s Japanese aftermarket feel for no real good reason (e.g. Work equip 01 or ssr mk ii). More than 7 isn't uncommon, but the spokes need to be thinner.

{"prompt": "First Year PhD Student Increasingly Disillusioned This is a throwaway account and I will try to skirt around any information that would identify me. I am in the US. I apologize for the length of this post but I am at my wits' end.  ___  I went to a very prestigious high school and, due to financial reasons, had to lower my gaze from the elite universities that most of my classmates ended up attending. I went to a pretty good public university on a full scholarship and did my best to never look back. I started as a CS major due to interest in high school. I got a research position in my second year (which I held for the rest of my undergraduate career), but found myself increasingly pulled towards mathematics and theoretical CS over the more application-oriented curriculum.   After some deliberation, I moved over to majoring in physics. (Actually, I felt I was so deep into the CS major that I might as well finish the degree, so I double majored.) For many reasons, I enjoyed the subject much more, but I was behind my classmates and my grades ended up \"suffering\" (A-s and some B+s, low in my eyes) for it. I caught up fast enough to have a good GPA in upper-level courses, but I did not have any room to explore graduate courses or electives due to my double major. I ended up finishing in ten semesters, which required taking multiple summer courses and a few semesters with course loads that made my advisors sigh. I had room for exactly only one elective (analysis) and one graduate physics course (QM).   I very often felt insecure about my non-extraordinary setting. I really want to say that the school doesn't matter, and that a committed student can be great anywhere, but the world has seemed to disagree with me on every single occasion. To try to keep a level ground, I periodically messaged friends studying physics at Ivies so that I could self-study material at a more sophisticated level. I have also worked through a general undergraduate math curriculum as I lean heavily towards mathematical physics. As of now I am still self-studying math, currently algebraic topology (Hatcher), next functional analysis (Conway).   My Physics GRE was something like 75%th percentile, which disappointed me greatly. I kept my head up and did not hold myself back when applying for PhDs. I did extensive research and applied only to schools I felt strongly towards, one of which was my undergraduate university. One of my advisors mentioned a very competitive scholarship for a full-ride to a English university, so I also applied for the Master's-equivalent there. That was my giant reach, and I was optimistic that my hard work would translate better through my essays than through my grades and raw data.   I was eating lunch with my friend when I saw the email that I wasn't chosen for the scholarship (after getting to the final round). I made a stupid excuse to him and went to the lab room where I put my head down and cried until I fell asleep. The truly awful part was a line in the email saying (paraphrased) \"Everyone who got to this stage is such a good candidate, this is probably the first time you've been turned down from something like this,\" after spending five years battling uphill so hard.   In the end my choice was between a PhD at my undergraduate institution, and admission the English school with no financial assistance. Because of COVID (and money, like always), I went with the PhD. I am in my first semester and the feelings of inadequacy get worse every week. I am still trying as hard as I can, but I feel like I am at an insurmountable disadvantage in my position and that a career in academia is completely doomed. Conversations like this recent one in r/math (which I frequent) constantly reinforce the idea that I am on a sinking ship. I love teaching and I love researching; a professorship is an absolute dream job for me. However, the ratio of applicants to job openings is not in my favor, and I am nowhere near the top of the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 pile. I really want to believe that school names don't matter, that your advisor doesn't make or break your career, etc., and that your own merit is almost all that shines through, but I have never ONCE seen evidence for this after reading hundreds and hundreds of stories.  ___   I need advice. I am giving up fast. Worse still, I can't think of any other places I'd like to be -- I don't want to code as a career, and I am too \"pure theory\" to lean into more hands-on industry positions.", "preferred": "Just a couple of comments.  First of all, I think many people here empathize with your struggle and share some of your feelings. It does hurt to be rejected, unfortunately, there are quite a few of those on the road, which is generally pretty long: PhD and several postdocs. Saying platitudes like do not give up and continue the fight is futile: it is your decision and only you could know what's best for you. But I honestly believe that it is possible to get a job of your (I stress current) dream even after graduating from a public university.  Getting a position in academia, especially in what seems to interest you the most (theory), is hard and I do not think there are any prospects of becoming easier. Definitely getting a degree from one of the first tier universities helps a lot, but it should be taken with a grain of salt. Just a degree from say Princeton or Harvard does not guarantee a professorship. I personally know several people who didn't get a position (for several different reasons) after a PhD at an ivy league university.   One of the biggest advantages of the best schools -- apart from being surrounded by (on average) the best people, not only professors but more importantly other students -- is having access to the network of people, and it is not in a bad and corrupt sense. On average a professor in Harvard has more friends (or just colleagues with whom they are on good terms) than say a professor from a third tier university. It is not to say that there are no good public universities at the same time. I do not know what your university rank is but from what you told it seems that your professor is not isolated from the world.  The danger of staying at one and the same place is that the longer you stay there the more it is considered to be against you, unless this is Harvard or akin to that. It would mostly be viewed that you stayed there for the lack of options and not because this was the best place for you.   In order to have better chances of getting a professorship one must stand out from the crowd (of equally or even more competent people) in some important aspects. Doing research which does not attract interest from the community (which is mostly the case for average universities) will not help, visibility could be crucial.   So choose a topic of your research accordingly, look at what interests not only you but what also is of interest to other people. If you cannot get a support for working on the subject at your place try contacting professors from other universities. It is not guaranteed that every single one of them would be happy to start immediately working with you, but you'll never know without trying.  Lastly, maybe try opening up your mind. I do not mean it in an offensive way, but focusing only on physics (theory) may not be the best strategy.", "rejected": "You may have worked hard and performed well academically, but no one owes you anything.

But poor candidates from top name universities also exist. Accept it and move on, there is nothing you personally can do about it unless you suck up the financial burden or another magic scholarship fairy smiles upon you).  The reason I don't feel any sympathy for you is your last sentence:   \\> I don't want to code as a career, and I am too \"pure theory\" to lean into more hands-on industry positions.

We didn't have health insurance so my mom was used to toughing anything strange out. After a few days I noticed this red line was getting longer and following my mom's vein. I had a long conversation with her and got her to go to the hospital. She had to be admitted and was in the hospital for like 3-5 nights with a blood infection.    They told her she would have died within a few days if she hadn't gone to the hospital.  Like I said we love cats and both have cats but I definitely understand people who don't.   Also growing up my best friend had an aunt who had a cat named Jake. And this cat did not play well with anyone. They had to keep it locked in their bedroom when company came over. It would just attack anyone it didn't know. Full on attack to kill kind of attack.  Maybe we shouldn't name cats human names is the moral but some cats can be crazy. Just like some dogs can be. Neither of these cats were abused or mishandled or not being taken care of. They just had emotional problems or something. Animals can be crazy. Humans included."}

Different academic institutions have different policies regarding relationships between faculty, staff, and students. If this professor has a direct supervisory role over the student, then that is probably an issue. If not, then its likely not something the University will want to get involved in. Moreover, if you do it anonymously, then it will really seem like it was an aggrieved party, and might cause some blowback from the professor onto the student.   Maybe this seems unlikely to you, but what if you are wrong? Regarding the affairs, is it causing issues that would make it your business? Are these students getting preferential treatment in their classes? Are you being threatened for knowing? Or are you just wanting to call out a bad actor? Not everyone has the same notion about what a relationship should look like, and who knows what these people are up to. You could really really mess up the students', professor's, and his wife's lives by getting involved, even if no policy was actually broken. This really seems like not your business with a low chance of reward, and a high chance of things going sideways for people other than yourself. Anyway, if the cheating is as bad as you think, and its known widely enough such that uninvolved people know, then it seems extremely unlikely to not blow up in this persons face naturally.", "rejected": "The only thing they\u2019d do anything about is #3.

Nothing fancy at all - build on a tortilla to make it low-carb, put a lid on the skillet, and cook for 10 minutes or so on medium-low heat.  One of my wife's favorites is BBQ chicken pizza, and I usually make it with part-skim mozzarella from the supermarket.  (Yes, I know, that's a sin against pizza!)  So I tried using fresh mozzarella.  I bought a small wrapped knob of fresh mozz from the store, sliced it relatively thin (maybe 1/4 inch, at most?), pressed it between paper towels for 10 minutes or so, then built the pizza.  But it made a mess.  It was still edible, but not pretty at all - the cheese slid off the slices, and seemed to \"spread\" a lot more than the part-skim I usually use.    So what is it I need to do differently with fresh mozz to make good pizza with it?

You're new to industry, so I would absolutely try and color this as \"observations\" instead of straight advice.  1. Being short staffed usually means people switch between tasks frequently, which costs a lot of time in the field of engineering. It's more efficient per dollar spent to have less switching and more focused domain expertise. 2. Burnout kills teams like Dominoes. You understand the urgency of timelines and the need to get product shipped, but when supposedly rare overtime pushes become the standard expectation it saps morale which leads to a rapidly self-perpetuating downward spiral once even one person quits. 3. Certainly there are skill gaps on a team of that size. It's likely more efficient to hire someone with that missing expertise than the rest of the team trying to learn/fill in the gaps.  All of these points will resonate from a BUSINESS perspective and hopefully accomplish your goal.", "rejected": "Workaholics often have a home life they're avoiding.

{"prompt": "[Aliens] What tactics should the Colonial Marines have implemented to optimally complete the mission?

And didn\u2019t start listening to her until most of the marines were dead anyway.  1. As far as the mission goes. It was to assist the colonists, rescue them if needed, or at least see why they weren\u2019t responding. To simply nuke it from orbit from the get go would be a waste of resources and would violate the rescue part of the mission. However as soon as confirmation is gained that all colonists are dead, I would\u2019ve ordered an air strike to destroy the \u201cdeadly infestation that would\u2019ve only continued to bleed resources\u201d  2. Gear wise, they were pretty well prepared for a scenario way worse than what they were supposed to prep for. The turrets for example should\u2019ve been overkill, but ended up saving their asses. In all honesty I wouldn\u2019t have given them any more gear than they had given the information at hand. (maybe if I listened to Ripley, I would\u2019ve brought more turrets and flamethrowers)  3. Tactically... well I\u2019d have just told them not to enter the reactor room when all their weapons cannot be fired inside. Had they gone \u201cwell shit, the place is messed up so there\u2019s probably something dangerous in this room. We\u2019d better be able to use our guns. Oh what? We can\u2019t shoot our guns in there? Then let\u2019s explore the rest of the facility and set up auto turrets in front of the reactor in case anything is lurking in there.\u201d They would\u2019ve survived with minimal casualties had they done that. Also, I\u2019d have sent two-three marines back to the ship after seeing the initial carnage. It\u2019s the only way off the planet so you\u2019d better cover your ass.

In their defense the Marines thought they needed to hurry to rescue the colonists, and had no reason to believe that the xenomorphs were anything but dumb animals. Anyone could have made the same mistakes. A more considerate approach would be to wait while a scout drone or an android takes a peek.  If they knew about the heat exchangers, the hopeless state of the colonists, and xenomorph ambush tactics after losing the android they'd do things differently. Switch to non-AP ammo if they have it, burn as they go to smoke out hiding xenomorphs.  The sentry guns were also highly effective. If you could lure the bugs away from the nest then you could cull half of them far away from the giant fusion reactor. They'll give up if they're losing and retreat, but xenos don't seem to inherently understand guns any more than Marines inherently understand xenos.   The Colonial government would reprimand me for losing an android on a scouting mission (they're expensive), but I would argue that the android was clearly defective and possibly rebelling anyway because Ripley was the one to point out the heat exchangers on the schematics. It's like it wanted the whole place to explode. See, this is why I'm openly racist against replicants..."}

I like my job, but I'm really having trouble with the town. My friends back home describe me as a friendly and outgoing person, yet it is hard for me to make friends here. No one is mean; I'm just having trouble finding people I vibe with. I attribute this to two factors:  1. I'm single (the town is very family-focused). 2. I'm just not that into the activities that are popular here (i.e., sports, church, and the outdoors).  There aren't even activities I would enjoy doing alone here. I'm a big foodie (the restaurants here are all about meat, meat, and more meat); I enjoy going to museums (the museums here are extremely small and regionally-focused); and I LOVE shopping (this town has little more than Walmart & Target).  So, as you can see, I'm really out of my element. I love to travel, and I'm willing to take on pretty much any city. However, I've never wanted to live anywhere other than a large city, and now I find myself in a town straight out of a Hallmark movie.  Has anyone else found themselves in this situation?

That meant going to education fairs and see what offers existed, at one point I thought of joining the army but I was too old for it(27). I did a professional course related with construction, but that was, I wouldn't say a waste of time, but shouldn't have done it. I also did a course in occupational health and safety, it was good to know that I didn't want to be a paper pusher.   I always liked engineering, but never thought I was smart enough for it. I had decent math skills but never had studied physics.

Classes were from 6pm to 11pm plus Saturdays 8 am to 2pm. I met other people in a situation similar to mine and made a few good friends. Working full time and studying engineering full time is hard, it was difficult to learn so much stuff for physics in such a short time one but I managed to pass two physics courses, calculus and applied chemistry. I liked what I was studying and felt capable to do it, but staying in my country at this place wouldn't work well. So I went to Denmark and studied full-time. Finished my degree and did an internship where I realized I didn't like some of the stuff I did. At that point I realized I liked coding more. So went to study one more year, this time a master to convert to IT. Finished that and have been working full-time for almost two years and I can say I found what I like.

{"prompt": "Help with Simone de Beauvoir : The Second Sex? \"In the darkness of night, man invites women to sin. But in the light of day, he rejects sin and her. And women, sinners, themselves in the mystery of bed, show all the more passion for the public worship of virtue.\"  We all agree that man are hypocrites by encouraging the women to make the sin, but in the day to reject it and her.

The Second Sex, in particular, has suffered from bad translations!  I've done some searching, and I can't seem to locate a version in the original French online (and I don't have a physical copy handy).  But my guess is that this sentence suffers from some of the translation defects mentioned in that link - an excessive effort to reproduce the sentence structure and rhythm of the original French, without capturing the meaning of the original.  The good news is that this overly-faithful translation provides a fair number of clues what the original French might be.  So my guess a what a slightly better translation would be:  &#x200B;  *And women, \\[also\\] sinners, themselves \\[complicit\\] in the mystery of \\[the\\] bed, show all the more passion in public for the worship of virtue.*  &#x200B;  To explain my choices here - I think it's important to make clear that it is not only women who are being identified as sinners, thus the \"also\".  And \"themselves\", most likely a translation of \"elles-m\u00eames\", supports this, which I try to lock in by adding the word \"complicit\".  Finally, the English clumsily implies that women are in bed while showing support for  \" the public worship of virtue\" - so I moved \"public\".  I was half tempted to replace \"\\[the\\] bed\" with the more explicit \"intercourse\", to step back a bit from the French tendency towards metaphor and guard against Anglophone literalism (\"what's mysterious about the bed?\") but decided against it.   &#x200B;  I don't see in this excerpt any indication of the idea that \"women are inferiors who tempt men to sin\" - just that women are even more eager than men to deny in public the existence of private sexuality.", "rejected": "I believe other posters are on to the correct answer - that, rather blatantly, men are hypocrites.

{"prompt": "Is ABET Accreditation Important? Hi, I'm a high school senior in Turkey and I am trying to decide which university I should prefer after my university exam. The highest-ranked university in the exam is Ko\u00e7 University. However, its engineering programs are not accredited by ABET. The programs are accredited by another organization named MUDEK and the organization is a part of the Washington Accord. It says on the internet that if a member of the Washington Accord accredits a program, it is counted as accredited by ABET.   Is ABET accreditation important after graduating? Would the mentioned situation create a problem, or did you experience something like this?", "preferred": "Hi there! I am currently going through the process of getting my license without an ABET degree. I have a CEAB degree (Canada). CEAB degrees are on the Washington accord as well and because Canada is the neighbor, many states directly say they accept CEAB.  To become an engineer in the USA, you need to go through NCEES. You will need to take the FE exam in your 4th year of engineering (so you have the fundamentals down) or right after graduation. Most likely to take the FE you will need to get your education verified which costs $350 USD for NCEES to do, but once they do it, you never have to do it again and you'll never have to provide transcripts again because its on NCEES. You do the education verification once you graduate and have your transcripts and proof of degree so you can send those in. You will also need course catalogs (the things that say the details of every course) for each year of study and the courses you took, so its best to save those from your schools website each year because finding archives of the course catalogs afterwards is painful (at least it was for me). Once you have your education verified, you take the FE and then the PE. Now here's the fun bit, every state has a different procedure for the process of becoming an engineer. Some states require you have your education verified by NCEES if its not an ABET degree, other states will accept ABET and CEAB, and some even say that if its on the Washington accord your good, but, and I just found this out, if you are in a state that accepts a not education verified degree and you move to another state that requires it, you'll have to do the process, so you might as well just do the process anyways if you don't know where you'll end up or if you ever think you'll move states. While my current state doesn't need my education to be verified, I am doing it anyways so that if I ever move, which I can see occurring in my lifetime, I will not have to go through the process of getting everything with my transcripts etc sorted out as honestly its a huge hassle. Another thing with the PE and different states is the whole procedure going from graduate to \"EIT\" (Engineer in Training) to licensed engineer. Some states require that you pass the FE and submit an application to be called an EIT after passing the exam and then require you to get 4 years work experience before you are allowed to take the PE exam which is basically the FE exam but slightly harder - it contains pretty much  everything you learn in undergrad with math and conceptual questions, but, funniest part ever, no ethics subject on the PE (this to me is the most important trait in an engineer and they could care less it seems). Other states don't have the EIT registration part but have a 4 year experience requirement before you take the PE exam and some states just have \"decoupled\" it entirely and you can take the FE and PE whenever. To get the license and stamp, however, you have to have 4 year of experience no matter what state your in. Hopefully that makes sense.   &#x200B;  I highly recommend if you plan after your degree is completed that you move to a US state that has a decoupled system. Take the FE and PE as soon as you possibly can while you still have the information fresh in your mind because after 4 years, it gets really rusty and these tests are basically just math tests that you have to pass, they don't really care about how good of an engineer you are. While it sucks that when you \"finish\" you aren't done with school yet, its way easier to just focus on two tests than 6 at a time (I had 6 courses each semester at my school and it was hard, but I worked hard and graduated at the top of my class!). and its way better to not have to relearn everything 4 years later.   &#x200B;  Check out this link to get an idea of what states accept what in regards to education:  https://www.sru.edu/documents/academics/online-learning/Engineer%20Licensing%20Requirements%20by%20State.pdf  Here is the NCEES page you'll need to eventually make an account on. You can also find more information about the FE and the PE and what state accepts what. Spend time on this website as its your guide to success in the USA engineering world.  https://ncees.org/   If you have more questions, feel free to contact me. I know this is a wall of text, but I hope to inform others how it works when coming from abroad. I tried to learn all of this when I was still in university, but no one really could tell me all the information I needed to know. Even now while actually going through the process of figuring it out, I still get conflicting information from my state and NCEES and others, but hopefully me above experience helps you and many others that stumble across this post.", "rejected": "If you ever want to be licensed as an engineer (some folks don't care about it), it's essential."}

{"prompt": "Why haven't modern-day Socrateses, or even Epictetuses emerged from academic philosophy to shake up the world? Why do Academic philosophers seem to operate in hermetic communities and discuss topics with little or not application to practical life? Why aren't they making an impact?", "preferred": "I think this implied idea that Socrates is radically unhermetic is on quite shaky ground.  You can find lots of different estimates for the population of Ancient Athens, so I\u2019ve picked a reasonable hovering number at about 120,000 people, within an Ancient Greek population of less than 10 million, spread out over an enormous area (far larger than Modern Greece) covering various city states and islands with highly variable relationships with each other, and different political structures. So that\u2019s roughly the population of modern London covering huge chunks of the Mediterranean coast and Black Sea, and in so doing therefore much of the world as then known to the Greeks prior to Alexander\u2019s conquest. So that\u2019s Athens itself with a population about half of the Borough of Lambeth (big up) within an Ancient Greece the populational size of a London spread across the aforementioned Mediterranean coastline and Balkan Peninsula, accounting for a significant chunk of the then known world.  Socrates was only one of a number of people satirised by Aristophanes, who associated him with philosophers *generally* (including the Sophists to whom we now consider him opposed), and in so doing thought of him as a ridiculous character with nothing to say worth listening to. He was of the wealthy citizenry, never knew slavery (slaves making up as much as half or more of the population), and was able to pursue the leisurely pursuits of what we would now call the urban upper middle classes, such as philosophy, without financial impingement. So he was a wealthy citizen in a small borough of London, hanging out with the other wealthy citizens, some chunk of whom never so much as bothered to work out what he thought in the first place before ridiculing him, who was eventually put on trial and executed during a time of significant political disquiet because he was perceived as offending the sensibilities of important people in the borough.  This isn\u2019t a final answer to your question, and covering Socrates\u2019s posthumous influence just isn\u2019t within my power right now, but it should shake up any perception you may have of his being a sort of beacon light that shone through all of Athens and therefore the world in his own lifetime. He\u2019s not even, I dunno, Lenin. See his interaction with a slave in *Meno* (a fictional dialogue, sure, but a representation of him as a character by Plato): he calls the slave boy over to demonstrate that an untaught slave has knowledge of mathematics, he doesn\u2019t immediately start preaching the radical reformation of the social world to the masses.", "rejected": "There is actually a good analysis to be done here, but unfortunately no one ever bothers to think about it every time this question is asked. My short answer would be something like: particular incentives and historical trends since roughly WW1 have resulted in many Anglosphere academic philosophers (the situation is different in say, France) largely trying to avoid involvement with anything considered political or mainstream. This includes everything from:  - Nietzsche's disdain for politics, the misuse of his work during WW1 and WW2, his \"rehabilitation\" after WW2 as more of an individualist and less of a political thinker, and the subsequent influence he had on other thinkers  - Analytic philosophy's general avoidance of politics and preference for language, logic, and other \"apolitical\" topics  - The increasing dominance of the media/YouTube/social media on political discussions and lessening influence of traditional academics and thinkers.   The short answer is, if an academically-trained philosopher *wanted* to be the Socrates of 2022, he would probably end up as someone similar to Jordan Peterson (oversimplifying topics and getting cozy with the media), \u017di\u017eek (a bit clownish and repetitive to get attention) or Peter Singer (known largely for a single issue and not for being a \"philosopher\" writ large.) I'd also add that Stoicism seems to be doing fairly well in the mainstream and guys like Massimo Pigliucci are reasonably well-known."}
{"prompt": "CMV: Ceaselessly Hate-Sharing the Posts of Our Political Enemies Does More Harm Than Good I'm from the US and personally lean pretty far to the left, so my Reddit feed includes several left-leaning subs, and some days it feels as though my feed is dominated by reposts of tweets from Ben Shapiro, Matt Walsh, Stephen Crowder, Charlie Kirk, Marjorie Taylor-Greene, Lauren Boebert, etc. I like to laugh and gape at the dumb things they say as much as anyone, but at a certain point it feels like the sheer amount of signal boosting we do of extremist and troll voices does more hard than good.  First, I want to acknowledge the one positive that occurs to me (there maybe be others) -   1) **It gives us a window into the opposition's thinking.** However stupid these beliefs may seem to me, they're held by millions. And while some of these people are just troolish pundits - Crowder, Kirk, Walsh, etc - others are actual members of the US's national governing body. So however much I might cringe at what they're saying, it might also be important for me to hear it so I know what I'm up against.  But I personally just feel that the downsides are stronger -   1) **It feeds the troll.** These people go out of their way to post the most incendiary possible version of their beliefs specifically to garner attention, both good and bad. They want to rile up their base, but also to rile us up. All press is good press if you're a scumbag, and they seem to take pleasure in our frustration/horror/mockery. And even if we're just reposting a tweet, inevitably that's going to lead more people to the original tweet.   2) **It makes us believe that everyone on their side agrees with them.** In the same way that delving into abortion statistics reveals that the conservative (and liberal) rank and file have far more nuanced views than their most extremist flank, I find that talking to just about any conservative is more complex (and genuine) then the gotcha jabs and distorted statistics and extremist takes that people like Greene and Shapiro post. Yes, plenty of people agree with these crazies, but plenty don't.   3) **It makes us dumber.** Some of our beliefs might really benefit from some scrutiny. Some of our positions might be opposed by real evidence or persuasive rhetoric that's worth hearing out. But we'll never believe that as long as we mostly share and engage with the stupidest voices on the opposing side. I don't believe in a false equivalence, or endless devil's advocates, or needing to defend every belief, but I do think we can end up more smug or arrogant than we deserve if we only engage with moronic trolls.  4) **It makes us defined by our opposition.** This one's a bit more nebulous, but we know we live in a time of record \"anti-partisanship,\" where more people than ever before vote to stop the opposition's agenda rather than to advance their own. This usually encourages a type of legislative paralysis where we end up celebrating the status quo, because the goal was \"beat them and stop negative change\" instead of \"enact positive change.\" I think we'd just be healthier if we spent more time upvoting those we support and trumpeting their words and deeds rather than trashing those we oppose.   Anyway, that's all. I'm excited to hear the thoughts of others.", "preferred": "In the case of mainstream liberals (Republican and Democrat voters), you're right. Those people are building an ideology of contradiction, voting against policies instead of for them and building a belief set over opposition rather than reform.  In the case of leftists (socialists, communists, and labor reformists), it's valuable practice for two reasons. First, because it opens the door for pointing out the bourgeois tactics hidden beneath PMC rhetoric, things that may be obvious to journalists, historians, and experienced leftists but not to younger people stuck in the Matrix. Second, because it shows solidarity among a minority, which helps people feel like they're not insane for eschewing rhetoric that demonizes their way of life, values, or even existence.", "rejected": "1) It's not trolling if the people genuinely believe the argument. Do you think most of those people you mentioned are shills or true believers? I would put it at 50/50 at worst. Which means it's only half trolls.  2) I mean... does it? I know \"reasonable\" moderate conservatives that really just want the government to spend less and say they can't hear dog whistles who have certainly expressed disdain for both elected officials and conservative pundits. They still listened to Rush. That doesn't mean they are a monolith though.  3) Just because you're mocking someone else's absurd beliefs doesn't mean you don't scrutinize your own. These aren't mutually exclusive. Also you didn't demonstrate why it makes us dumber. You said it causes us not to scrutinize our beliefs. There are tons of very intelligent people who are incapable of self reflection.  4). No disagreement here but in a plurality system that's essentially unavoidable. I don't vote *for* Democrats. I vote *against* Republicans. That totally sucks but until we move to ranked choice, eliminate the EC, and make gerrymandering illegal we're stuck with it."}

{"prompt": "CMV: The invention of the Nuke was a good thing Hear me out,  I think the invention of Nukes was a good thing for the following reasons.  1. The Pacific war would have been an even bigger loss of human life since Japan was preparing for an Invasion and armed everyone with guns including civilians and were ready to fight a guerilla war. The two nukes prevented that from happening 2. The Cold War would have been WW3 cause without the fear of a nuclear fallout from happening the Soviets or Allies would have been a lot more trigger-happy in some situations for example Cuba or during the Berlin Stand off 3. What also can be considered is since WW2 or better put the invention of the Nuke there hasn't been a war between the big Nuclear states or World Powers  Conclusion: Of course Nukes don't stop wars from happening, but they sure stop them from evolving into an even bigger disaster", "preferred": "Here are some fallacies in your argument:  1. **Appeal to consequence:** This is the fallacy of assuming that a certain action or event is good or bad based solely on its consequences, without considering other factors such as morality or ethics. For example, the statement \"the invention of nuclear weapons was a good thing because it prevented a larger loss of life\" is an appeal to consequence because it implies that the end justifies the means, regardless of the moral implications of using nuclear weapons.  2. **Slippery slope:** This is the fallacy of assuming that a certain action or event will necessarily lead to a series of other events, without sufficient evidence to support this assumption. For example, the statement \"the Cold War would have been WW3 without the fear of nuclear fallout\" is a slippery slope because it assumes that the existence of nuclear weapons was the only factor preventing a third world war, without considering other potential factors that could have played a role.  3. **Hasty generalization:** This is the fallacy of drawing a conclusion about a group or category based on insufficient or unrepresentative evidence. For example, the statement \"there hasn't been a war between the big Nuclear states or World Powers since the invention of the Nuke\" is a hasty generalization because it assumes that the absence of war between these countries is a result of the invention of nuclear weapons, without considering other factors that may have contributed to this absence of war.  Now, let me try to answer to what you wrote:  1. The use of nuclear weapons in Japan killed hundreds of thousands of people and had long-lasting effects on the affected areas. Additionally, the decision to use nuclear weapons raised ethical concerns about the use of such devastating weapons, and has been the subject of much debate and discussion. Furthermore, the use of nuclear weapons in Japan may have set a dangerous precedent for the future use of these weapons, which could have had catastrophic consequences for humanity. Therefore, while it is possible that the use of nuclear weapons may have prevented a larger loss of life in the short term, their long-term consequences should also be considered.  2. It is not accurate to say that the existence of nuclear weapons was the only factor that prevented World War III. There are several reasons why this statement is incorrect:  - The presence of other military alliances and global superpowers: The Cold War was not just between the Soviet Union and the United States, but also involved other countries and military alliances, such as NATO, which played a role in preventing a full-scale global conflict.  - Economic and political relationships between countries: The Cold War was not just a military confrontation, but also involved economic and political relationships between countries. For example, the United States and the Soviet Union were both part of the United Nations, which provided a forum for diplomatic negotiations and conflict resolution.  - The role of diplomacy and international negotiations: Despite the tensions and confrontations of the Cold War, there were also efforts to avoid a full-scale conflict through diplomatic negotiations and international agreements, such as the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which aimed to limit the spread of nuclear weapons.  Therefore, while the fear of a nuclear conflict may have played a role in preventing a global war, it is not accurate to say that it was the only factor, and other factors such as the presence of other military alliances, economic and political relationships, and diplomatic efforts should also be considered.", "rejected": "While it is true that the use of nuclear weapons in World War II likely prevented further loss of life by bringing the war to an end, it is not necessarily the case that the invention of nuclear weapons was a good thing. The potential destruction that nuclear weapons are capable of causing is catastrophic, and their existence has created a constant threat of global conflict and destruction. Additionally, the production and maintenance of nuclear weapons is costly and diverts resources that could be used for other purposes. Furthermore, the fear of a nuclear conflict has had a destabilizing effect on international relations and has led to numerous close calls and tense standoffs.  While it is also true that there has not been a war between nuclear-armed states since World War II, it is not clear that this is directly due to the existence of nuclear weapons. It is possible that other factors, such as the formation of international organizations and the increased interconnectedness of the global economy, have played a role in preventing such conflicts. Furthermore, the use of nuclear weapons in warfare is generally considered to be unacceptable, and the vast majority of countries have committed to not using them"}

I relocated to Israel a year and a half ago and I do not speak fluent Hebrew or Arabic. I'm 13 weeks into my second pregnancy and was referred for abortion at my ultrasound today due to a \"huge edema around the entire fetus\", \"delicate pulse pattern\", and \"chest fluid\". I can't communicate with any of my doctor's fluently enough to fully understand what is going on. I usually rely more on the paperwork and printouts they give me which I can translate on my own time.

I just want to know the cause and ramifications of edema or what it even really is. And maybe just a name or explanation as to what's going on.

{"prompt": "CMV: Parents who have no custody over their children should not be required to pay child support. So this comparison came up in another thread and I thought it was apt.   If a parent or parents decide they do not wish to keep their child they can relinquish it to the state and not be involved in its life.  The adoptive parents, assuming there are some, don't receive monthly child support checks from the biological parents.  We recognize that a biological parent who has no involvement in their spawn's life is not financially responsible for that child if they don't want to be.   This changes if only one parent wants responsibility but the other does not.  If Parent A says they have no interest in a child, but Parent B says they do, Parent A ends up paying Child Support to Parent B.  My argument is that for Parent A the decision is the same in both cases.  She or he is not involved in the child's life and has no custody.  The decision is the same on their part and therefore the result should be the same from that decision: they aren't financially liable.   The onus of raising a child should be on the parent(s) raising it, and not on the biological parent(s) who have no hand in raising the child.  _____  > *Hello, users of CMV!

If that's not the case, the next best thing is that the child has two parents who want to raise them, and are capable of giving them a good environment with some help. Since we don't hold any non-parent responsible for the existence of a child, there is no third party to look to for support; the state will step in rather than jeopardize a child's well-being.

If that's not the case, the next best thing is that the child has one parent who wants to raise them and needs some assistance. Since we hold both parents responsible for the existence of a child, the state would prefer the other parent provide this support if they are able, rather than distributing that burden to taxpayers.   If even that isn't the case, the next best thing is that the state takes custody of the child. This is preferable to leaving the child to be raised by someone who doesn't want them.

{"prompt": "CMV: When discussing politicians and elections people put far too much importance on personality and \u201clikeability\u201d as opposed to policies, experience, and consistency, usually because they know little to nothing about what their candidates actually stand for. People are already beginning to talk about the 2020 elections and potential candidates, and once people I\u2019ve been seeing people talk a ton about how important it is for a candidate to have personality or to seem \u201clike the kind of guy I\u2019d have a beer with.\u201d Specifically, I\u2019ve seen a lot of this in discussion about Elizabeth Warren.  Now, I\u2019m not arguing that those factors don\u2019t play a major role in election outcomes. My argument is rather that they do, and that fact is ridiculous. People shouldn\u2019t vote based on who is like \u201cthe everyday guy\u201d, or who has character. They should vote for people based on what they stand for, and how equipped they are for the job. I think that the reason at least many people care so much about what a candidate is like is because they are uninformed about what their candidates stand for, and so they go based on gut feeling and personal impressions as opposed to actual items of importance. I understand that personality is important to an extant. It helps politicians win over other politicians, and is helpful for anything involving negotiation. But it shouldn\u2019t be prioritized above the actual policies, and the fact that likeability is seen as more important is a major reason why we have so many political issues in America. _____ > *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

I'm going to work with this point right here. To be quite frank, I think politics in America are worse than they've been in a generation.   And why is that? Well, I'll point out that our leaders (Trump, Pence, McConnell, Pelosi) are historically unliked. We haven't had such unpopular leaders in a generation, either. Hillary was unliked as well. How long has it been since someone who a majority of people liked held power? That would be Barack Obama, a couple of years ago.   So it doesn't make a lot of sense to me to say the push to likability is creating political issues in America. If anything, I think the problem is that people care so much about their party winning they're willing to support politicians they don't particularly like. And sometimes, the reason someone is unlikable is that person has massive character flaws that render him unfit to lead. But that's all I'll say on that.", "rejected": "We love statistics and rationality and numbers and platforms and policies and all that.. at least we think we do. Someone could have the most economic and economically brilliant platform, but if they are a terrible leader, it will never happen. We have to take a peak at Trump here. He is motivating both sides. Dems are working hard to rebuttal him and when he does things like leave the Paris Climate Agreement, social influencers philantropists etc stepped up and started showing the US all of the green initiatives they were focused on. It caused a ton of newsand got everyone talking about it. His job numbers are great and that's partially thanks to Obama, but Trump has continued the trend to a very prosperous state. A politician that doesn't have the personality to motivate will always lose, regardless of platform. You may agree or disagree with Trump, but you can't deny more people than ever are engaged in politics all over the globe and people are standing up for what they believe in even more. I believe we are in a huge turning point in our existance as humans since cultures can now interact almost unimeded thanks to instant messaging and translation apps. I think, regardless of policy to a degree (don't want a true dictator), it's better and more advantageous to bring someone in because of their personality. Not all governements have strong checks and balances but the US is pretty good at giving the house power over  POTUS when nessessary. I think a person's ability to stir conversation and attract interest in topics is very important.   I guess with that being an absolute argument for perosnality, I think there should be an understanding of the platform. I think Trump is a new version of Republicans that inspire people to act more than anyone else int hat party and I'll say the same of AOC. She is like Trump in that what she says stirs debate and gets people talking. Sure a lot of the white noise is calling Trump and AOC stupid, but past that people are debating things like social norms, taxes, immigration, etc. There is a huge value in picking the right personality. Almost more value than the platform itself."}

COVID threw those progressions off \u2014 old people stayed out due to outbreaks in assisted living facilities; empty nesters didn\u2019t want strangers in their homes or want to travel to shop for retirement homes in Florida and Arizona. And perhaps their single adult children decided to move home rather than be stuck alone in an expensive apartment in a shut down city.  But at the other end you had various people wanting to move up to the next housing stage because they wanted more space. So people who might have planned to buy a house in a year or two jumped into the hunt for a starter house or their upgrade to a bigger house when parents were working from home and kids were remote learning. So something like 3x as many people wanting to buy as usual, but half as many looking to sell as usual created a bottleneck in the housing market. If seniors don\u2019t downsize, then people in starter homes can\u2019t step up, and that means nonstarter homes for those wanting to buy their first homes.  Apartments are going up for a few reasons. One, people are returning to cities as vaccines are available and city life is more available. The rent deals to be had when people chose not to renew and moved back home with mom & dad in the suburbs last year are gone. And inflation means higher costs to maintain and keep up apartments, higher utility bills, causing landlord to raise rents to reflect cost increases.  And both home sales and rental apartments were affected by COVID causing delays in building, as things like permits and inspections took longer, building material shortages and skyrocketing prices, labor shortages all meant fewer new housing until being built to replenish obsolete ones, growing population of adults, etc.", "rejected": "Rich people/corporations buy up properties as an investment.

{"prompt": "CMV: Glitter should be a regulated substance and artists should be required to have a license before being able to purchase glitter Let me preface this by saying that we look at glitter all wrong. Most of us look at it as just another piece of the artist's toolkit, but the fact is that glitter was weaponized long ago by people willing to send envelopes full of glitter to your enemies, or even by the infamous porch-pirate revenge video who used weaponized glitter not once, but twice.   Now, let's look at why glitter should not be available to the general public:  1) It's a pollutive nuisance - glitter can't be recycled, and using it on regular paper materials means those can't be recycled either. Glitter can make its way into waterways and from there via fish directly into the food chain. There are already record levels of microplastic contamination discovered in tap water.   2) It's a health hazard - glitter can irritate your skin, or make its way in to your eyes and even blind you. The British Medical Journal has urged doctors to look out for patients complaining of swollen eyes and vision loss after a 49-year-old woman was almost blinded after glitter rubbed off a Christmas card into her eye. It had formed into a clump, causing a lesion. According to Frank Kelly, a professor of environmental health at King\u2019s College London, \"[Glitter] could deliver chemicals to the lower parts of our lungs and maybe even into our bloodstream\".  3) It's dangerous to have around the house - the fact that glitter is sold to everyone willy-nilly means that parents buy it for their children, who are not the sturdiest of creatures at the best of times. Knock over glitter once, and your home is no longer hospitable. Vacuuming or sweeping can never collect all the glitter, and once you knock it over, it becomes an actual menace/hazard: babies and pets can ingest the glitter, it gets all over everything, and all members of the household will transport the glitter throughout the house, extending it's reach and range.  Glitter should be treated similar to any other chemical hazard which can cause drastic pollution, poison food chains, cause physical damage to multiple different systems of the body, and similar to some chemical agents and weapons, are extremely hard to purify an area once glitter begins to spread.  I'm not saying that we should ban all glitter, as recommends Dr. Trisia Farrelly, an environmentalist from New Zealand\u2019s Massey University (\"I think all glitter should be banned. Producers should not get away with making a profit out of the production of disposable, single-use plastics, while bearing little responsibility for the damage.\").

{"prompt": "I believe the \"men's rights\" argument holds no water and is mainly championed by those who don't understand feminism, CMV Feminism affects both men and women. Certainly we associate femininity with the female sex, but that's exactly the reason why it affects men as well. The modern face of feminism is one that attempts to break down societal gender constructs, i.e. femininity = woman, masculinity = man, while empowering both men and women to rise above them.   I am a man but I've been an ardent femininist for my entire life, and it pains me to see ridiculous and often ill-informed opinions on one of society's most prevalent issues. Men seem to feel threatened by feminism, as if empowering women means to de-empower men. This is not true in the slightest! Any legitimate, academic discussion of feminism acknowledges that gender constructs affect men to a great degree, and I've yet to meet a single educated feminist who would disagree. I understand that there are radicalists in every movement out there, but fringe opinions do not affect my beliefs.  The men's rights movement (which I truly hope only exists on the internet) is unnecessary. Men have held positions of power for millennia - is it really necessary for us to feel better about being a man? Where feminism seeks to tear down the ideas of being male and female, men's rights activists (or should I say, soapbox preachers) seem to do nothing but boost male egos. It's juvenile and frankly makes little sense to me.  I don't think I'll be converted out of feminism, but please CMV about the legitimacy of men's rights.", "preferred": "I was raised by a staunch feminist and grew up in a liberal, feminist dominated society.  Much of what they have done has been a vast improvement, because women certainly did have a lot of problems that needed to be addressed.  The men's rights movement is not about putting women down (except for the bitter segment of them that is...).  Education favors girls at the expense of boys.  (No one wants to make it fair by making things harder for girls.  They just want more done to help the boys.)  There is a presumption in divorce cases that the mother gets custody.  If a father gets custody, people assume the mother must have done something REALLY bad to forfeit it, because everyone just accepts that she \"should\" have it by default.  Mary Winkler murdered her husband and got away with it.  Claimed he was an asshole and that made it okay.  Try reversing the genders and see how that would have played out.  Domestic violence affects men, no one cares, they are supposed to \"man up\" and just deal with emotional and physical abuse.  Men get dirty looks and the cops get called when they play with their daughters in public, because there is a presumption of wrongdoing.  If a man paying child support loses his job, it doesn't matter: his child support payments aren't adjusted.  (Fuck deadbeat dads, seriously, fuck those guys, but this is fundamentally wrong, to MAKE someone a \"deadbeat\" by requiring the impossible, no matter how much they WANT to support their children but have reduced income?)  Rape in men's prisons.  It's treated as a joke or just punishment.  No matter how evil a person is, no one deserves rape.  No one.  Imagine if people joked about female rape like they do male rape.  These are just a few issues off the top of my head that men face, and feminism is doing NOTHING to help with any of that.  Why would they?  Feminism is about helping women.  Then there are the areas of \"female privilege.\"  These are areas where feminism is actively putting men down.  A woman has the privilege to call a man a creep and he will be shamed by women and by many men as well (the MRM calls them \"white knights,\" I personally don't like that term though).  A man is guilty of being a creep until he proves himself innocent.  There are indeed many creepy guys in the world, but justice is not served by having women be able to wield this \"thought-terminating clich\u00e9\" like a club.  They can silence dissenting opinions anytime they want to, by calling a man misogynist, or creepy, or whatever.  They are just considered right by default.  That's not okay.  False rape accusations.  There have been documented (as in caught on video) cases of women accusing a man of rape for petty or vindictive reasons, when he never even TOUCHED her so much as with a finger.  But these criminals are usually not prosecuted.  Feminists actively deny this is any kind of a problem.  They actively condemn the prosecution of women seeking to have men falsely imprisoned.  Men are just considered disposable.  Hillary Clinton said \"women have always been the primary victims of war.\"  I, personally, am lucky to live in a nice area, where I usually don't get shat on for being a guy.  Never got dirty looks when playing with my daughter.  Never got called creepy.  Have no plans to get divorced.  I do worry sometimes about pissing my wife off though, knowing that my happy life is based on her sufferance: if she WANTED to, she could divorce me tomorrow, take my house, and make it so I could hardly see my children again.  I don't fear her doing that, but it's unsettling to know that she COULD.  That the system, with all the guns, would side with her no matter what, because she's a woman.  That I'd have to have incontrovertible evidence to overcome the bias inherent in the system.  It happens.  It happens all the time.  I was giving a speech once, and I was using domestic violence as an example.  In my example, by the pronouns I used, it was a woman assaulting a man.  Everyone laughed.  No part of my speech was funny.  But the juxtaposition was to people, because \"everyone knows\" that domestic violence is men hitting women, so when the pronouns made it clear it was a woman attacking a man, the response was to laugh.  I don't need the MRM to boost my ego.  That has precisely nothing to do with anything.  My ego is nice and healthy, not too big, not too small, I think.  But the system is stacked against men in a lot of ways, legally and socially.  A lot of the ways don't affect me personally, but I hate INJUSTICE, and so I care about men's rights.  I've never had the cops called on me for taking my daughter into the bathroom at Toys R Us, but THAT HAPPENED to a man.  And people actually tried to remove her from him.  If the wife wasn't there to stop them, what would have happened when the man tried to fight back?  This shit is real and it happens and I hate it.  \"Men have held positions of power.\"  So what?  I'm not in a position of power.  MOST men aren't, and most men have never been.  The men in charge are a tiny group.  The majority of us are peasants.  Feminism doesn't care about me.  At all.  At all.  And if I say that, you know what I get?  \"Why SHOULD we care about you?  You have Male Privilege.  Stop whining!\"  Oh, whining.  Another thought-terminating clich\u00e9.  Another way to shut a person up, and not have to listen to the content of their words, no matter how calmly stated.  You know, I wouldn't mind having my feelings discounted by people, if they had the balls to admit that's what they were doing?  But it's when people SAY they care about equality and tolerance and helping others and sunshine and roses but it's all bullshit, because we don't have to care about THAT GUY because he's a creepy whiner and needs to man up, that is what really pisses me off.", "rejected": "> Where feminism seeks to tear down the ideas of being male and female, men's rights activists (or should I say, soapbox preachers) seem to do nothing but boost male egos.

It's a way in which women tend to be better off than men, and it's not feminism's job to change the world in a way that makes women worse off."}

{"prompt": "New York - Involved in a car accident. Cop and responsible party are friends. I was the only car stopped at a red light making a left-hand turn. The light turned green, and I had a green arrow. I started turning, the car directly across the intersection blew the red and t-boned me.    I saw him pick up his cell phone. He refused to get out of the car or acknowledge me. A few moments later, a police officer arrived. The other guy jumped out of his car, shook the officer's hand, and said, \"Thanks for coming, Dave.\"    The officer took his statement, and didn't say a word to me other than to ask me for my insurance card. He went back to his patrol car, walked over to me, and handed me a summons.    He said, \"You're receiving a citation for failure to yield. You can pick up the police report in 3-5 business days at the police station.\"    When I informed him that I had a green arrow and the other vehicle had, in fact, gone through a red light, he chuckled and said, \"The other driver is a Captain on our fire department. He's driven our engine safely through more intersections than you've ever seen. I don't want to hear it.\"    I replied, \"But I have...\"    He put his hand up in my face and said, \"You're not getting out of this by lying to me. You can attempt to contest your citation in court. I'll see you there.\"     I picked up the police report and it says that the opposing driver had a green light as he approached the intersection. As he entered the intersection, I drove into the intersection at a high rate of speed turning left without yielding, impeding the other driver's path and causing the collision. It says that when I questioned I did not dispute the other driver's account of the accident and was issued a summons.    What I was trying to tell the officer was that I have a dashcam that captured the entire accident. I rolled my windows down as soon as it happened so the audio is fairly clear. It shows us both stopped at the intersection, me entering the intersection with a green arrow, the other driver gunning it into the intersection (it doesn't capture the crash as it was from the side), me getting out and attempting to talk to the other driver, audio of the other driver calling the officer Dave, video of me giving the officer my insurance card, and then video of him handing me the summons and refusing to listen to my side.    The other driver has already filled a claim against my insurance. When they called and asked me what happened, I told them the truth and that I have the whole thing on video. They are not paying his claim pending an investigation.    I have court at the end of this month. Should I try to contact the officer ahead of time to see if we can amend the report?

I don\u2019t think an economic standpoint will change my view, because profit simply isn\u2019t enough for me to move my morals. there should be ways for networks to make money without advertisements. The problem is, with on demand and youtube it\u2019s hard to make a specific time frame, and a lot of profit on youtube comes from ad revenue. Either way, that doesn\u2019t make it right or good.

So basically, it\u2019s a necessary evil.", "rejected": "I agree with your premise, but I'd argue that a ban on ads for kids wouldn't work because those devious ad agencies will just start advertising toys \"to adults\" and kids would still see them.  Instead, we need to pass laws that make deceptive advertising open to civil suits for deceptive practices and further criminal prosecution if the deception amounts to fraud.  Things like pharmaceuticals should be banned from advertising, because you shouldn't be asking your doctor to prescribe a certain drug. You go to the doctor because they are trained to choose the proper drug for you and they have the skills to understand the documentation that explains what the drug is and how it works.  By opening advertisement up to lawsuits for damages they cause, if an advertisement is targeted at a minor and this causes problems for the parent, then the parent should be allowed to sue for damages, including punitive ones if applicable.  Outright bans don't usually work except in certain cases because ad firms have lawyers who will just find a way around the ban.

{"prompt": "CMV: Mask Mandates are necessary as people are kindof stupid, and there is no good argument against them For context, I live in Scotland, which does have mask mandates from the government, and recently traveled to England, which does not (I think they might have starting yesterday because of the decepticon varient or whatever, but they didn't when I travelled a month or so ago). In Scotland, 95% of people on public transport and in shops wear masks. In England, about 2% seem to. The point of bringing this up, is to make the point that if we want people to wear masks, we do basically need to tell them they have to, as most people are too stupid to do it without the government telling them to.   As for the mask mandates themselves, I have never heard a good argument against them. I often hear people say things like \"oh so should we have mask mandates for the flu then\", I don't see how this is a counter. I would be happy to wear a mask for a few months in winter when the flu is most prominent, and if there is a particularly bad flu strain, then telling people to wear masks seems justifiable even if only to reduce money spent in healthcare, not to mention that hospitals often get overwhelmed in winter.  Other arguments I hear are \"muh government telling us to do things bad\", to which the obvious response is seatbelts and not being allows to drunk drive, both of which are things that have small chances to negatively affect other people or you, which you can't do.   There are medical exceptions, which I do think should be allowed, although maybe with a slightly higher burden of proof than we have now. And I've heard good argument for why kids shouldn't wear them, although those argument are stuff like \"they need to be able to see each others faces to develop emotional intelligence\", not \"it's child abuse\" or some stupid shit like that.

{"prompt": "Ice Cream Recipe Calls for Whole Milk + Heavy Cream. Can I use some ratio of Half/Half or Light Cream instead of Heavy? I've been getting into ice cream making. I have a set of recipes that I like, but they always call for heavy cream, which requires a drive to the store, limited selection of sizes, and doesn't get much use outside of said recipes in my home.  Conversely, my corner store 2 blocks from my house carries light cream, half/half and every other ingredient I would otherwise need for a basic recipe.  Can I safely substitute light cream or half/half (at different ratios) for the heavy cream, or is there some other chemistry involved that will affect the end result?  Example:  Depending on your sources,  * Heavy cream is ~36% fat. * Light cream is ~20% fat. * Half/half is ~12% fat. * Whole milk is ~3.5% fat.   Recipe calls for 2 cups whole milk, 1 cup heavy cream. If I am doing the math right, this is ~14% fat.      (1 * 0.36 + 2 * 0.035) / 3 ~= 0.14  If I mix light cream to get the same overall percentage, is it the same?      (x * 0.2 + (3-x) * 0.035) / 3= 0.14     (x * 0.2 + 3 * 0.035 - x * 0.035) = 0.43     x * (0.2 - 0.035) = 0.325     x ~= 1.97 ~= 2  Thus 2 cups light cream and one cup whole milk.

With that said, pregnancy and parenthood are two very different things. Pregnancy is something only women have to go through. Parenthood is something both the man and the woman experience.   **In terms of pregnancy:**  Pregnancy is a women\u2019s *health* issue, and *only* women have to deal with the health impacts of pregnancy and childbirth, so only they have the ability to \u2018opt out\u2019 of it. Parental responsibilities, while they could be seen as a health issue in an abstract manner, are applicable to *both parties* once the pregnancy is over.   Here\u2019s what I mean when I say it\u2019s a women\u2019s health issue:   There\u2019s the obvious example of pregnancy threatening the mothers life, but that\u2019s not the main issue. Women, in general, even when controlling for known life threatening situations that were identified before birth, are 14 times more likely to die in childbirth than they are during an abortion.   Even if carrying a child to term does not result in death, pregnancy and childbirth takes a **massive** toll on women\u2019s bodies, and women should have the ability to do something before it takes said massive toll. I mean, pregnancy is 9 months of weight gain, fatigue, wild hormones, nausea, heartburn, constipation, peeing every 5 minutes, skin stretching, etc. and those are just the most common side effects of pregnancy. Then, obviously, childbirth is excruciatingly painful and risky. Then, after giving birth it\u2019s basically like recovering from surgery for 6+ weeks, combined with risks of other issues like postpartum depression. This is not something all women have the desire to go through, and even for those who do want to go through it, they might not want to go through it right now, and since it is their body, it is their decision to make about their health.   **In terms of parenthood:**   When there is a living breathing human being outside of the woman\u2019s body, things become a little more equal in terms of rights and responsibilities. And they are\u2014 if a woman relinquishes all parenting rights to a baby they just gave birth to, the father can still chose to raise that baby & sue the mother for child support.   So again, since men and women play very different roles in conception, there is never going to be a perfectly equitable way to determine rights and responsibilities.

What are the benefits in terms of performance?", "preferred": "From my point of view in the 1980s manual transmissions had three major advantages over automatic transmissions:  1)Manuals were faster.  The automatic transmissions weren't slow but they did not allow for shifting at the highest RPMs, where an engine usually makes its highest horsepower.  This was borne out over and over in the testing records of the various car magazines.  2)Manuals gave more control.  Downshifting when I saw some stupid nonsense approaching gave me more options to do something with just my right foot: slow down with engine braking, maintain the same speed at a higher RPM, or accelerate out of the trouble by picking a line and threading the needle before it closes.  Until the Porsche Tiptronic came along, manually moving between an automatic's gears, like going from D to 2, was rough and harsh on the transmission.  Notice none of those options involve hitting the brakes, which before ABS could be a real problem.  Skidding would mean going straight into whatever you were aiming at when you hit the brakes.  As I became a better driver more advanced moves like double-clutching and speed shifting became options.  (Although I spent way more time trying to learn it and practicing and getting in trouble than I ever did getting *out* of trouble with those tricks!)  3) Manuals are less expensive all around.  The car itself was always cheaper if it had a manual, and not just because manual transmissions were cheaper to make.  Manuals usually came with a no-frills baseline package that drivers like me recognized as lighter weight and easier to fix.  That would include hand-cranked windows and a crummy radio you were likely to replace anyway.  There was less mechanical complexity in a manual, so it cost less to maintain and far less to fix, although nobody wanted to have to replace a clutch.  Steadily over the years much of that has changed.  Car brakes are awesome now and allow for control while emergency braking.  Total game-changer, that one.  Performance transmissions are computer controlled to shift at ideal points, far quicker than a human can throw a lever like a gearshift.  They will furthermore refuse to risk blowing the engine in a mis-judged double-clutch down two gears.  Manufacturing tolerances are so much better that a complex system like an automatic transmission can last the life of the car.  And the power.  Modern cars have lavish amounts of soupy torque and soaring horsepower that one could only dream of in the 1980s.  Sometimes far more power than a normal driver can manage with a manual transmission--that was part of the art of mastering race cars, and while many of us wanted to be that, we were not.  Sometimes it's just far more power than *any* manual transmission can manage.  If I could hop back into my tiny 1.6L Miata and toss it around the mountains like a toy, I surely would and to hell with safety.  But in the real world I would have to think rather seriously now about how a manual transmission is right on the verge of *giving up* safety, performance and control, instead of *increasing* it, like it so obviously used to be.  And I guess that right there underscored some attitude difference between drivers which I'm sure still helps define the automatic/manual divide.  Some drivers wanted to have more points of control so that they could be more in the moment of driving.  Others wanted to put less effort into (and pay less attention to) driving.  And looking back the ones I considered \"lazy\" weren't wrong.  They were coming to terms with the modern reality that for most people your car is sitting around in traffic, waiting.  Why would you want to row your car to work and back every day?", "rejected": "They are still produced here actively. Never seen a paddle-shift being sold that isn't on a really expensive vehicle.  I like manual transmission anyway, adds to the fun of driving."}
{"prompt": "What material X is typically or best used in Y application? Hi /AskEngineers, I'm looking to expand my materials knowledge and was just wondering based on your field and experience, what have you come to know as a material X that's typically used in Y situation? It can be a specific application or general, but common situation. For example you use it often for prototyping before production or it's the best material against a certain chemical. Off the top of my head the materials I can think of (in no particular order) are:  - Aluminum 6061: Common grade for use as structural parts, jigs, quick prototypes, molds, etc. Probably one of my most commonly used materials. - Aluminum 5052: Common grade for parts that need to be bent or formed, but balanced for structure. - Stainless 304: Common general purpose stainless steel. This grade can work harden, so there are similar grades that are better for machining. - Stainless 316: Higher corrosion resistant stainless for marine type applications. - High Speed Steel: Common low cost material for machining. - Carbide: Common high performance material for machining. - Polycarbonate: Common plastic used in many applications such as windows, IP/NEMA enclosures, product enclosures/casings, etc. Easily machined. - Delrin/acetal: Common high strength/low friction plastic that's easy to machine. - PVC: Common material for tubing of various applications. Can be flexible or rigid. - PTFE: Common low friction, high temperature resistant, chemical resistant plastic. - Polyimide: Plastic suited for extreme temperature/strength applications. Probably most commonly seen as that gold film/tape Kapton. Not cheap. - Acrylic/PMMA: Common optical plastic for lenses and optical fiber. - Silicone: Common high temperature rubber suitable for sealing and thermal padding.  - Buna-N: Common general purpose rubber for sealing. - Borosilicate glass: Common general purpose, thermally stable glass material for lab equipment where silica is not needed. - BK7 glass: Common optical glass typically used when fused silica isn't need. - Silica/quartz glass: Common superior optical and thermally stable material. Can take significant thermal shock. Material also has incredibly low thermal expansion coefficient.", "preferred": "You can add SS 303 along with 304 and 316.

However, there are a few caveats, including some mentioned already.  Vegans/vegetarians.  It imparts flavor. You may not always want your finished product to taste like lard. Fryer oil is neutral in flavor.  It breaks down quickly, and smells like shit when it does. Fryer oil lasts longer.  It has more of a tendency to bubble over. Fryer oil has anti-foaming agents in it.  It polymerizes well, which is great for cast-iron. Shitty for deep fryers. Fryer oil comes off easily with a little degreaser.  It's expensive. Fryer oil (used to be), cheap.  It coagulates at low temperatures, so there is a greater than zero possibility of ignition when firing up from cold in certain models. Fryer oil is liquid at room temperature.  tl:Dr; Lard is excellent for deep frying, but not in a commercial setting.", "rejected": "It has a low smoke point (burns easy\u2026which can effect quality of food and longevity of oil) .

{"prompt": "brown butter in enriched breads? Hi All,  Is it possible to use browned butter for brioche or panettone? I couldn't find a lot of recipes online that do this, but in principle if I brown it, add back the water that's been lost, and then re-solidify it in the fridge I don't see why it should not work similarly to normal butter.  But I could also imagine that this would result in greasy brioche/panettone.  &#x200B;  Does anyone have any insight?  &#x200B;  Thank you!  &#x200B;  edited for specificity", "preferred": "Butter that's resolidified isn't the same chemically or physically as butter before it was melted. You mention you plan on adding back in the lost water; what's your plan to reconstitute it so it doesn't split? It's harder than you'd think.   If you're just looking to add in the brown butter flavor I'll share a little trick I came up with back in my chef days: make brown butter normally, but add in powdered milk as well. When you're making brown butter it's the milk proteins that actually brown, so the milk powder will work in the same way and brown as well. You can then strain it off and use it as an ingredient, which adds an amazing flavor to practically anything.", "rejected": "It depends on the specific recipe, but since brown butter is technically melted butter, it\u2019s a bit different from using room temperature butter"}
{"prompt": "Why do socialist revolutions tend to result in totalitarian dictatorships? If you look at the USSR under Stalin, China under Mao, Cuba under Castro, or even going back to the French Revolution and Robespierre, it always seems like socialist or communist revolutions result in a totalitarian strong man seizing power and causing terrible oppression and suffering to the people that live there. Why is that? Is there something fundamentally wrong with the political philosophy that lends itself to this? Or is it because these revolutions will oftentimes go too far, and try to erase the social and political systems that have maintained order in those countries for hundreds or even thousands of years (i.e. getting rid of the monarchy and religious institutions at the same time and replacing them with entirely new and untested systems and ideologies.) Or is there some other reason? Has there ever been a communist country where this didn't happen, and the government functioned reliably for a long time and the people enjoyed a high standard of living?", "preferred": "Social scientists often draw a distinction between *political* revolutions, which seek to change the government, and *social* revolutions, which seek to more basically transform social relations.  Theda Skocpol makes this distinction in her book *States and Social Revolutions*, which continues to be the most widely cited book on revolutions.  The classic example of the former is the American Revolution, where primarily the government changed, and the later the French Revolution, where the whole social world of the *Ancien Regime* came crumbling down.  I think what you're seeing here is the checkered history of social revolutions more than anything intrinsic to socialism.  I wrote in old post:  >Social scientists sometimes separate out two different kinds of revolutions: social revolutions like the French, Russian, Turkish, Chinese, Cambodian, etc Revolutions which seek to change everything, and political revolutions like the American, the Glorious, the Jasmine, Egyptian, etc. Revolutions which seek to change politics, but not culture or social relations more broadly.  You may be interested in older posts of mine.  Here, I talk about the origin of the term \"revolution\", and how \"revolution\" didn't really mean *revolution* until the French Revolution.  Here, I short piece about the distinction between social and political revolutions, a distinction that interestingly was first proposed by Trotsky.  Here, I have a much longer bit about revolutions more generally, including an alternative typology between \"tipping point revolutions\" and \"state breakdown revolutions\", with particularly reference to the revolutions of the Arab Spring.  The thing I think that should be emphasized is that we generally ee political revolutions as good (the American Revolution, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Glorious Revolution in England) and we often see periods of rapid social change as good (the end of Jim Crow or Sexual Revolution in America, or the Quiet Revolution in Quebec), but when a political revolution seeks to usher in a rapid period of social change, be it from the left or the right, we often see massive destruction.  The conscious effort to change social relations is generally better at destroying the old order than building a new one.  Occasionally, you have ones that combine both successfully, like the Turkish Revolution, but in those cases it's often not clear how much the social changes occur outside of the big cities.  Books like *Republic of Empire*, about a small, provincial town in the Black Sea region, suggest that the social revolution was mostly restricted to places like Ankara and Istanbul.  Though Burkean Conservatism typically valorizes the existing order and seeks to stop change (think William F. Buckley's famous definition, \"A conservative is someone who stands athwart history, yelling *Stop*, at a time when no one is inclined to do so, or to have much patience with those who so urge it\"), there are \"Right Wing\" attempts at Social Revolutions that one could categorize as \"right wing\" and were equally destructive and totalitarian.  The Iranian Revolution, an attempt to instill firm religiousness in both state and society, is an obvious example.  Nikki Keddi and Theda Skocpol have a good back and forth about the Iranian Revolution does fit Skocpol's social revolution model.  Skocpol's article is called \"Rentier State and Shi'a Islam in the Iranian Revolution\", Keddi's article is simply called \"Comments on Skocpol\".  A summary of Skocpol's argument can be found [here](A conservative is someone who stands athwart history, yelling Stop, at a time when no one is inclined to do so, or to have much patience with those who so urge it.).  Both are mainly about the sequence that led to the revolutionaries' success, rather than the social consequences of the revolutionaries' success.  The Taliban's social revolution, or more shockingly recent, ISIS's social revolution, are other examples of religious revolutionaries coming to power and changing not just the manner of rule, but the manner of how people are allowed to relate to each other.  The fascists are another interesting of social revolution from the right.  While when we study the Nazis, we tend to think of them in terms of their murderous regime and their invasions and war-mongering, at home they also had great effects even on ethnic German life.  Shmuel Eisenstadt wrote both an article and a book about the \"multiple modernities\", about how communism, liberal democracy, and fascism all presented very different visions of modern social and political life.  My favorite book on the social effects of the Nazi social revolution is German sociologist Tilman Allert's *the Hitler Salute*.  It focuses on just how greetings changed, but uses this to delve into how the Nazis changed daily life and basic social relations.  So, in short, while political revolutions have a mixed record of long term success, social revolutions--whether from the left or the right--have a pretty poor record.  When socialist parties come to power (and willing leave power) through democratic elections (as in much of Europe), you have very different outcomes.", "rejected": "Have any of the Communist/Socialist revolutions in history ever **replaced** something *other* than a totalitarian dictatorship?"}
{"prompt": "This is probably a stupid question, but is there anything that almost all philosophers agree on, or is everything in philosophy up for debate?", "preferred": "Anything almost all philosophers agree upon and that isn't up for debate generally isn't \"philosophy,\" because philosophy is an academic endeavor that investigates open questions. If a question is closed then it isn't really an issue for philosophers to investigate. So, for instance, all philosophers agree that the world is round and that the gods don't cause rain and that earthquakes aren't caused by wind inside the earth and that evolution explains the diversity of life we see (although at one point in time philosophers didn't agree on these things and they were live philosophical issues).", "rejected": "The laws of identity, non-contradiction, and excluded middle are essentially the foundation of logic - they're easily the least controversial concept I can think of.

{"prompt": "Hiring Decision Based on GPA: discrimination? (GA, USA) I'm a manager and we hire and train individuals, generally right out of college or actively in college, to perform tasks for upper level staff -- almost like personal assistants to executives. We have very high turnover due to the nature of the position (people moving onto the next steps in life) and we expect it.   Today, my boss said they had some complaints that I was discriminating in my hiring process by not hiring low GPA candidates.   Some of the staff that we are hiring for have expressed very specific requests (no lower than a 3.5 gpa) while others do not care as long as the candidate is good. I tend to stick pretty close to the 3.5 rule, but have hired lower GPA candidates if they interview well and would be a good fit for the team.  This year especially, I have received significant amounts of praise for my new hires and how smoothly they have transitioned into the roles as opposed to the person who previously hired for my team, and I feel this is directly a result of my stricter interviews and hiring criteria.   Given that we tend to interview a lot of college students, I do look at their GPAs as I feel it is a direct reflection on their work ethic. My boss is willing to hire employees as low as 2.5 GPA, which I don't think is in the best interest of the company unless they are a rockstar candidate with a good explanation.

Have you become a regular and developed a relationship with the staff for some camaraderie?", "preferred": "At home, when I'm short on time I make one thing. Our bodies just don't respond very fast so if my diet is balanced over the course of a week I don't worry about each meal. Chicken marsala on Monday, steamed broccoli on Tuesday, stuffed baked potato on Wednesday, big salad on Thursday. \\*grin\\* It's a different approach to cooking a bunch and eating leftovers. I definitely cook \"complete\" meals regularly to stay in practice getting everything on the table at the same time.   Some things work well for big batch cooking: lasagna is a 'feed the freezer' meal; pasta sauce I make a couple of gallons at a time and can. Pickles. Chutney. I also cook ahead: a roast pork loin has leftovers sliced thin for sandwiches then shredded for tacos then turned into faux barbecue. Grill lots of chicken and the extra goes to chicken salad, tacos, soup, stir fry. You can eat chicken all week without eating the \\*same\\* chicken all week.   I eat alone on travel. I just go out and eat. Laptop, phone, book. I look for places with good WiFi and ask for a seat near an outlet. Never miss a chance to eat, sleep, go to the bathroom, or charge something. The rest of the mantra is \"or press up fuel and water\" but that is for a different venue. I don't let them shove me in a corner or a noisy spot and definitely not near kids; I'm fine saying \"okay - I'll eat somewhere else - hang on while I check in on Yelp.\" Lots of meals are just too big in restaurants so I'm not averse to ordering an appetizer or two for dinner. Some things on the other hand are perfect for leftovers: burritos, lots of Chinese dishes.", "rejected": "When I was living by  myself, I would cook 4x one meal, and then get ready for another which I'd usually decide on day 3 or 4 of the last meal.

Since I learned to bake at an early age but not really cook, I spent several years just picking recipes I had no clue about and trying them out.  Learned braising, poaching, chiffonade, and likely other fancy words just to get my head wrapped around cooking and how to play with recipes.  And hey, it became fun to cook with friends. :D  *Edit* And since you're cooking for just yourself, you can make as many mistakes as you want and no one else will know the difference!"}

People aren\u2019t going to eat the same thing like chicken and beef. If you\u2019re defending the dogs, you should probably stop eating chicken and other meat.

{"prompt": "When did humans start fighting for control of territory? Has this been something inherent in humans since the 'start' or were there certain societal and other precursors?

The usual battery metaphor is bad because it presumes one starts at 100% \"fully charged\" when waking and goes down in charge as one is awake. In reality it's more like you wake up with an empty bucket that fills with sleepiness, and the longer you are awake the heavier it becomes.

{"prompt": "I live in Washington State. Can I be prosecuted for gifting my terminally ill father a firearm? Throwaway for obvious reasons.  My father is, and has been, very sick for about a year. He was diagnosed with two different forms of aggressive, untreatable lymphomas. He has nerve death in his feet from years of alcohol abuse (been clean for about 8 years, though!). He had to have his spleen removed earlier this year, and he has several other health issues that I'm not particularly familiar with because I'm not a doctor and don't understand the terminology, most of which are related to his cancers.  For the year+ since his first cancer diagnosis, he's been pretty elevated about the whole deal. He's made it very clear to my siblings, my stepmother, and I that he does \\*not\\* want a long, drawn-out old person death. He already has a DNR/DNI order on his chart, and has repeatedly said to all of us that he's happy with the way his life shook out and he's ready to leave the world. This was when he knew he was terminally ill, but was still relatively healthy and mobile.  Well, last week he had a major health crisis. Because I'm not a doctor I don't really understand the details, but the MAST cells in his system caused an enormous anaphylactic reaction that caused his blood pressure to drop. He also had an infection in his lungs that needed to be treated with an aggressive course of antibiotics. Worst, though, was that something about this incident triggered four different strokes. Three were relatively minor, but the fourth was a medium-to-large-sized event.  My sister, stepmother, and I have been taking shifts with him in the hospital since the event. He's having trouble finding words, but is still capable of expressing himself for the most part. Through all the physical therapy, medications, and hours of sitting in a hospital room, he has made it absolutely clear that the lifesaving interventions we put him through after the stroke were way too much and he would rather die than go through any of it again. He has begged us to change his physician's order for life saving treatment (POLST) form to specify that he should not receive treatment for similar events in the future.  The thing that's driving me nuts about this situation is that our stepmother (who has durable power of attorney) is having a very easy time dismissing these statements as \"oh he's just depressed\" and has been dragging her feet on changing the POLST form and other preparations to fulfill his wish of getting the fuck out of the hospital, back to his retirement home, and getting a chance to say bye to his family and friends before going through the lengthy process of a physician assisted suicide. My sister (who's in medical school) believes that he won't get to the point of a PAS, and believes he'll go next time he has a similar event like the one he had. The big issue I'm concerned about is whether this event happens before the POLST form is changed. If that happens, and he's saved again to come back in an even more disabled state, my father is going to die hating us, and I can't live with that.  Things REALLY came to a head yesterday at the hospital. I'd never seen my dad cry before in my life. I'd also never seen him get so angry. Before my stepmother got there, he begged me to bring him a gun so he has a way out in case things got even worse. Even with his speech impaired from the stroke, he told my stepmother and me in no uncertain terms that he hated us for being so selfish and cruel by keeping him around.  I doubt my father would put a bullet in his head if he had a gun. I think he just wants one so he knows that if things get too unbearable, he knows he can end it all in a split second, rather than having to hold on and wait for another stroke, or heart attack, or infection to end everything, or waiting for the gears of the state to slowly turn to the point where he can have his PAS. But I believe that everyone on earth should have the agency to decide when, where, and how they die, and he is and clearly has been suffering horribly for the last week and a half.  If I were to roll to the gun store and get him a firearm, and he shot himself with it, what would be the legal ramifications for me? I'm okay with my family hating me and even being vindictive. I'm a financially independent adult, so I'm not concerned about any sort of aid being cut off. But if there's a chance of me being prosecuted for this act, I won't do it.

{"prompt": "CMV: Refusing to engage with someone who has different views to you is a sign that you don't know what you are talking about I am someone who really enjoys discussions and I can find myself on either side of an argument depending who I am talking to. I will often play the devils advocate, and if I'm talking to someone who is (for example) pro-choice, then I'll take the pro-life perspective, and viceversa.  Because I do this so often, I encounter some people who will respond with anger/disappointment that I am even entertaining the views of the \"opposite side\". These discussions are usually the shortest ones and I find that I have to start treading more and more carefully up to the point that the other person doesn't want to discuss things any further.   My assessment of this is that the person's refusal to engage is because they don't know how to respond to some of the counter-points/arguments and so they choose to ignore it, or attack the person rather than the argument. Also, since they have a tendancy to get angry/agitated, they never end up hearing the opposing arguments and, therefore, never really have a chance to properly understand where there might be flaws in their own ideas (i.e., they are in a bubble).   The result is that they just end up dogmatically holding an idea in their mind. Whatsmore, they will justify becoming angry or ignoring others by saying that those \"other ideas\" are so obvisouly wrong that the person must be stupid/racist/ignorant etc. and thus not worth engaging with. This seems to be a self-serving tactic which strengthens the idea bubble even more.", "preferred": "I am splitting this into two responses because I think these were different enough ideas to warrant it.  I see similar views to yours quite often, that this comes down to a simple difference of opinion, that not being willing to engage with people who hold certain views means living in a bubble and not being willing to listen to anyone who disagrees.  One of my first reactions to this is to ask if you truly, honestly, think there is no topic that's basically settled.  If someone expresses support for white supremacy, unambiguously, is it worth it to talk to them?  Specifically, what ideas of theirs are going to be worth thinking about?  The ones where black people are thugs?  The ones where white people shouldn't intermarry?  But of course the world isn't so black and white, often white supremacists will deny being one, while still trying to make arguments that, while more benign on the surface, ultimately lead back to the ones from the previous paragraph.  This is where I come to my second question: do you really think people haven't heard a lot of the arguments before?  Like I personally have dealt with this most with regards to gender issues, specifically with mras.  At this point, I've heard their arguments, heard what they have to say, and within a sentence or two know what route they are going to take to spread their bullshit.  If I hear something truly new, I would stop and listen, even if I know someone who identifies as an mra is likely going to get back to saying bullshit, but frankly, I don't hear anything new.  There comes a point where it is completely justified to accept that a certain group is going to continue to behave the way they have been.  The third thing I want to point out is that just from the one example you list of topic, these conversations often involve things that cause serious harm to people.  The anti-choice perspective hurts women, hurts babies (because the anti-choice side does not actually give a shit about people once they are born, as we can see simply by looking at what kind of government policies they put in place), while providing no actual upside (abortions don't go down, just safe ones).  It's not surprising for people to be extremely upset about the topic.  You mention racism in your final paragraph, and there too, racism literally denies the humanity of people.  Of course people who face racism, especially systemic racism, will get upset if you take a pro-racism stance.  Now you may want to come back to me by saying that people disagree with how I portray this, and that's true.  The thing is, I have listened to both sides of this argument, and come to a conclusion.  Listening to both sides, deciding that anti-choicers are hurting people with no other upside, and not finding any use to listening to the same arguments from them over and over isn't \"dogmatically holding an idea.\"  That's called \"coming to a conclusion.\"  The final thing I want to point out is related to, but slightly different from my second point: if someone isn't willing to articulate the why, isn't willing to walk through or isn't good at explaining all the lines of reasoning that get to the conclusion of \"that's so obviously wrong that person must be stupid/racist/ignorant,\" does that actually mean they live in a bubble?  I know I frequently have moments where someone says something and I realize they have just expressed an idea I wasn't able to.  That is, the thought was already in my head, the reasoning there, but I couldn't figure out the right combination of words to properly express the idea.  Does that mean I was wrong before I figured out how to express the idea?  I....think that's pretty clearly wrong.", "rejected": "I'll sympathize with you in that I love to challenge someone's beliefs or arguments, even if I truly agree with them. At the very least, I sharpen my own logic and tactics and I can refine my own worldview. However, I've met people who, through conversation, it becomes very apparent that they only want to argue; there is no resolution to be met, not even \"agree to disagree\". They want to be hostile, if you don't agree with them outright then you're morally/ethically wrong, etc. I simply have no interest to engage these people. What's the point? There's nothing to be gained other than some narcissistic stroking of their own ego and your own frustration. It's not that I feel that I can't defend my point against these people, it's that I can clearly see that my position has no audience in any respect. That's not even a conversation, it's an exercise in futility.   Maybe I'm describing the people you are, but in my experience these people are usually the first to engage and then their ears immediately slam shut."}

{"prompt": "What is voltage, really? If you connect two real wires to the two ends of an ideal battery and leave them disconnected to anything else (i.e. its just a battery with two separate wires connected to its terminals but nothing else), and then \"looked into\" the wires with some sort of super-microscope, what would be different between them? How could we microscopically differentiate between a material at high voltage and low voltage?  I used to think that the high voltage wire would be positively charged and the low voltage one would be negatively charged (again, these are REAL wires so they can hold a little bit of charge). However this conflicts with my knowledge of voltage: it would imply that a neutral wire is a \"special\" value for voltage (namely zero volts) yet I learned that voltage is a relative number, so there should not be any special values (?).", "preferred": "We know that charges move from \"high voltage\" to \"low voltage\", but in reality it's the mathematical structure that's defined *retroactively* to produce that effect. Wherever an electric field points away from is, by definition, a high voltage area. A low voltage area is literally where the electric field points toward. This is because a charge will be pushed along an electric field, gaining energy as it does so.  If an electric field exists, voltage simply is where you are within it.", "rejected": "There would be no difference under a microscope, as electrons don't \"bounce\" photons on them to be able to see. And electricity - as we use it - is much easier to think off as a circuit- as electrons are always either going or coming from somewhere (or rapidly moving back and forth in an AC circuit). So a battery has no \"voltage\" until you measure it because you need to indeed close the circuit to measure the \"push\" of the electrons, which is the voltage, hence why voltage is also called the electric potential. Interestingly enough, electrons move from the negative post of a battery to the positive post, but if you look at DC electrical diagrams, the arrows show the current as if it's flowing from the positive post of the battery.  Electricity is an observable work of nature trying to equalize itself, all the time. You rub a balloon on a couch and move some electrons (negative charge) from one surface to the other, now there is too much negative electrons in the balloon, and will try to find that circuit to close equalize itself - which is what a battery is!"}

{"prompt": "CMV: After the 2016 election, there seemed to be a genuine effort by some people on the Left to understand Trump voters; the Right never makes any such effort, and Biden's election will prove no different. Throughout 2016's election, I saw a crazy number of articles from left-leaning sources about how liberals needed to \"reach across the aisle\" and attempt to truly understand why someone might vote for Donald Trump. We were asked to conceptualize their struggles and empathize with their suffering, to acknowledge their humanity and their pain.  Vox beseeched liberals to listen to Trump voters' concerns. The Atlantic profiled Trump supporter after Trump supporter to dispel the conventional wisdom that they were all racist boomers or antisocial white nationalists. USA today did the same. 538 did repeated statical analysis to disprove those stereotypes. The New York Times told us to \"stop shaming Trump voters\". The Washington Post suggested we empathize with Trump voters. Hell, even the quite literally Socialist magazine Jacobin made the same request.  Meanwhile, reviews of books about rural white working class society became vehicles for left-leaning publications to ask readers to feel pity for the underserviced social sectors that became Trump voters. \"Hillbilly Elegy\" and \"Strangers In Their Own Land\", for example.  My question, then is this: Why isn't the Right held to the same standard?   Where is the Fox News op-ed about how Trump voters need to work to understand the root cause of BLM? When hasn't the Wall Street Journal ever profiled an Antifa member or a climate activist or even just a bunch of Biden voters in general? When can we expect the Washington Times to do a multipart series on how the struggles of indebted students, DREAMers and the LGBT community led them to vote Democrat? What books have even been written about how the Right specifically has a moral imperative to empathize with the Left?  Now, I know there is ugliness on both sides. I have seen a rash of 2020 articles on how the Left can stop caring about Trump supporters, because they're all racist, homophobic idiots who worship QAnon in between sodomizing themselves with assault weapons. And I've seen plenty of crap on Facebook, Twitter and (ugh) Parler about how the Left is all commie, gender-confused snowflakes out to destroy America with mandatory abortions.   One side saying bad shit about the other does not (in my mind) invalidate my point.  What I'm looking for is instances of widely regarded right-leaning sources not only saying nice things about the Left, but doing so in a way that both validates its worldview and asks its audience to emphathize with it.

For the last four years, liberal-leaning people have absolutely hated every single conservative for even thinking in the same realm as Trump. See Alyssa Milano\u2019s Twitter for examples.   I don\u2019t think either side really wants to reach across. Both sides have a lot of hate for the opposition, and no one wants to really accept the other side.

Nobody needs to do soul searching to understand why someone would vote for a standard, boiler plate politician. Biden was put up as the safe choice to run against Trump.  It was had to understand why someone would vote for Trump because he was a perplexing candidate, even as the incumbent. His rhetoric was inflammatory, his behavior unpredictable, and his views idiosyncratic or arbitrary. He wasn't typical for a Republican or a presidential candidate. As president he was both provocative and relatively unproductive.  Biden promises a return to the same-old.

Hardness just tells you whether or not one material will scratch another; that is not what dulling is  Dulling is what happens when a thin edge (like a blade) folds over itself. That's related to the material of the edge, the thinness of it, and the amount of force being applied to it.   I could push my blade flat through water, and it would eventually dull it; It's the metal being too malleable at that thickness that causes it to dull.  Now, could you make it out of a less malleable material? Totally. But malleability is a sliding scale; The opposite of malleable is brittle.  I'd prefer my blades not hold an edge indefinitely, if the alternative is that they can snap or shatter under pressure.  On an unrelated note tho, keep in mind that hair is not weak. Your hair and fingernails are made of keratin; That's the same thing that reptile scales, hooves and horns are made of; It's very strong.   The issue is that our hair and nails are really thin.

{"prompt": "Steel vs. Aluminum vs. Fiberglass vs. Carbon Fiber vs. ?  Questions regarding strength, weight, and cost for cars Howdy -   I was thinking about future fuel regulations today and thinking about how the industry will meet them.  To me it seems there are two ways to make today's style cars meet those regulations - through more efficient engines and hybrid drivetrains and by channeling Colin Chapman who said \"simplify and add lightness.\"    The IC engine has become dramatically more efficient in the past 20 years through better computers, direct injection, variable valve timing, new materials, better FI, etc., so it seems that gains there are going to be incremental.  Hybrid drive trains are certainly a big possibility, especially if a consumer friendly KERS system is developed or battery tech takes off.  Other advances such as electric power steering and low RR tires that actually hold the road can also help with efficiency.  **I'd like to focus this question on \"adding lightness.\"**  I am a Lotus fan and that company, more than anyone, has traditionally focused on lightweight vehicles, most recently though the use of luminum \"tubs\" and chassis.  A nice video is here: Lotus aluminum bonding  In fact, Lotus Engineering has pioneered and licensed a lot of the tech involved (link).    In terms of \"tubs\" and chassis components, aluminum is much lighter than steel, but also costs significantly more and is not very \"repairable,\" making seemingly minor wrecks a total loss.  Carbon fiber is certainly lighter, but costs much more and cannot be manufactured quickly.  Can anyone offer anymore on this topic?  In terms of body panels, it used to be that fiberglass was lighter than steel - is that still true?  How much weight is saved by the use of carbon fiber?  Is aluminum still lighter than steel?

Carbon fibre is not repairable. Once delaminated or cracked you can't straighten it.   Steel and alu can be straigtened but repair is not easy.

For body panels you can't get  carbon fiber panels it as thin as steel. So you get it to half the wieght.   > Is aluminum still lighter than steel?

{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old: If the average lightning strike can contain 100 million to 1 billion volts, how is it that humans can survive being struck? The numbers in the title are from this source: http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/natural-disasters/lightning-profile/", "preferred": "**TL;DR the TL;DR**: In very specific conditions, it's possible for the electricity to flow around you. This causes severe burns, but can leave you alive if you're lucky.  -----------------------------------------------------  **TL;DR:** Often when lightning strikes a person, the person is wet. If the layer of water is less resistive than your internal organs, most of the current will flow through the layer of water. It'll heat up and burn you, but it doesn't necessarily kill you.   Also, often times lightning strikes in the vicinity of a person, but not the person directly. This usually means they'll get current flowing through their legs, but not across their heart, which usually isn't fatal. Again, serious burns will occur.  One more thing that contributes to this all is the fact that a fast changing current (like the short burst of a lightning strike) tends to flow through the outermost layer of whatever is conducting it, furthering the tendency to flow through the water/skin instead of your heart.  Also read /u/bearpics16's comment below. It explains the physiological changes lightning strike burns cause, which often result in death.  -----------------------------------------------------  **Longer explanation**  Something \"containing\" a certain amount of volts really doesn't convey well how it all works.  The voltage (or potential) is a measure for the difference in electric charge between two things. So when we say, there's 3.7V **across** a battery, that's a measure of how much work can be done when a certain amount of _electricity_ (charge) is moved from one terminal to the other.  The bigger the voltage, the harder the electrons try to go from one place to the other (which is why the water pressure analogy often is used). Dry air can  insulate about 3000V (3kV) per mm (about 76.2 kV per inch). So if you put two conductors 1 cm apart and put over 30kV across them, the air will start conducting. When this happens, the electricity will ionize the air, creating plasma. This is the spark you see.   Lightning is just a bigger version of that process, where the air in the clouds is electrically charged. This electricity tries to jump to anything with a lower charge. If the voltage across the air/ground gap is big enough, the electricity can flow across he gap.  Now, what you need to understand is that electricity only kills if you get enough of it flowing at once through the wrong parts. The amount of electricity flowing **through** something is the current or amperage.    People always say that it's not the volts, but the amps that kill you. In reality, there's more to it. You need enough voltage to get enough current flowing to hurt you. Your body has a certain resistance to electricity flow. (current = voltage / resistance).   What's also important is the path the electricity takes. A big-ass current flowing from the tip of you finger to the palm of your hand will give you a nasty burn, but it won't stop your heart from beating. A small zap flowing from one arm to the other might do that more effectively.  You also need to know that electricity will ~~follow~~ prefer the path of least resistance. If there's multiple paths available, the current flowing through each will be inversely proportional to each path's respective resistance.  Another thing is that a lightning strike behaves a lot like AC (it's DC, but the short burst nature makes it adopt behaviors from AC). One of the things AC does, is that it will flow through the outermost layer of whatever is conducting it. This is called the _skin effect_. This means that if you're the conductor, it'll prefer flowing around your internal organs, if your skin's resistance isn't too high.  Thus, if lightning strikes you when you have a layer of water all over your body (it's raining, most likely), that water might be conducting enough to keep most of the electricity from even entering your body. It just flows through the layer of water on your skin.  A lightning strike will heat that water up a lot, though. So you'll probably have some serious burns. But if there isn't an appreciable amount of electricity flowing through your heart, chances are you'll live to tell the story.   --------------------------------------  EDIT: corrected breakdown voltage for air, thanks /u/yanroy. Also, RIP inbox  EDIT2: ~~it's both~~ there's more to it. I realize this is dumbed down.

{"prompt": "CMV: \"Cancel culture\" and changing cartoon characters is mostly a way for white people to virtue signal/be \"saviors\" 1) The FSU Seminoles and the Chicago Blackhawks have *specific permission* from those tribes to use those names - yet they constantly get badgered by people not even in those tribes to change the name and that it's racist. I am referring to those two teams specifically, because they have that permission from tribal council - if those tribes allow it, who are we to tell them to change it?  2) I understand that it is extremely hard for POC voice actors to break into the profession. However, that needs to be reminded by new character being created & cast, not white voice actors being pushed out a job they've held for years to not get \"cancelled.\" The majority of people who were calling for the man who voiced Cleveland to step down were white. I also understand that  On that note, I believe that we need to defer to POC/minorities when a certain character is in question - Speedy Gonzales is a good example. White people pushed for his removal while Mexicans and Mexican-Americans protested for him to stay! It's not for us, people who are not in that community, to decide whether a character is good or bad. The creator of Ghost in the Shell LOVED the casting of Scarlett Johansson - which was accurate anyway because the robot that the main character resides in is outwardly European - casting an Asian woman would've been inaccurate to the story. But who complained? White Americans!  3) Dragging videos/tweets/etc made years or even a decade plus ago by famous people or influencers does nothing and implies that society as a whole refuses to forgive such transgressions and that there's no reason to try and strive to be better because it won't be believed anyway - especially when they've already apologized for it and there's no other instances of such behavior recently. Jenna marbles got bullied off of YouTube for videos she made almost a DECADE ago and had already apologized for, and there were no other questionable videos since then. What, then, is the point of dredging it up years later?  I feel the same with issues involving cultural appropriation - I constantly see white people putting down other white people for *appreciating* a culture I stead of appropriating it, when POC aren't even complaining about that specific issue - did the Polynesian people care that little white girls wanted to be Moana for Halloween, or did WHITE PEOPLE care so they could look enlightened?  In conclusion, I understand that, as we have privilege, we need to use our voices to help POC and minorities. But I believe there are two main issues:  - We end up talking OVER them and trying to tell them what they should be offended by, which implies they're not intelligent enough to decide by themselves/is incredibly infantilizing.  - We pull years old tweets and attack influencers and celebrities while refusing to believe that they have changed in the years since and also see that behavior as problematic now in an attempt to virtue signal and act like a good person.  I just really don't think that this is the way to legitimately help POC - obviously if they also agree there is an issue that's not the case, but I also think that problematic behavior from the past should be forgiven if that person has worked to become better - but we refuse to believe that it's not a publicity stunt when they do.", "preferred": "Here is my take on cancel culture and why it is not just white Americans that push for it.   The examples you gave I am not 100% familiar with so I apologize from the beginning of the circumstances are different. Also, there are many teams that have had permission to use certain names and likenesses. So here I go.   I grew up in projects and was raised on welfare and government assistance as a white male. When I was growing up the biggest race issues were not as they are today. I am an 80\u2019s baby. I looked up to many black people whom we now refer to as POC. I looked up to Tupac, will smith, Dr.Dre, and Bone thugs and harmony. But when I watched movies, tv, etc. I didn\u2019t see a good representation of POC then. I would see \u201cwhite shows\u201d and \u201cblack shows\u201d everything was divided and that was not vary good because when I was with my friends nothing signified my friends. Where there were 1 white kid and 4 black kids and 1 Spanish kid. So some people growing up felt guilty about that, just as I did. I just named my teenage idols but I had 100\u2019s to pick from of white people. So now we are here today and wonder how we got here. How did cartoons get banned, how is it now that ghost busters does an all women cast and people loose their minds, or cartoons get pulled because some people thought it was offensive. You see the way society growth works is through change. We had to change and get a better representation of everyone. Yes people have went a little to far but that is how growth works. It\u2019s sloppy right now and it will get back in order. Yes we shouldn\u2019t pull up people\u2019s past and bash them with it, but I really think that we aren\u2019t bashing the people that made jokes or slightly offensive stuff. It seems as though we are bashing the culture of its okay to say really hurtful stuff. The same things you joke with your friends and family isn\u2019t okay in a public display. That is the point that I think we are attempting to get to. Just a place where if a character is a certain race let that be played by that race. Right now 99% of characters are white so let us redesign some for other races. But let us leave their roles alone. Also, the drugging up of history shows that we are trying to correct the root problem where it\u2019s not okay to say things that are inappropriate in the public eye. We all do have the freedom to express ourselves but we can\u2019t choose how others will react to that.   I really hope I shed some light on why cancel culture is not all bad and why it\u2019s not just white people complaining for no reason. Just take wrestling for an example. In the 80\u2019s -early nineties the POC were not the major world champions until Ron Simmons. That was because there were a mass majority of white people watching. Yes, my friends and I rooted for who we liked but just like me loving hip hop, when Eminem came around all the white kids were happier because we had representation. Now look at it. White rappers, female rappers, etc. It really helps us all overtime when we have a better representation, I believe.   If I completely missed the point. I am sorry. I just wanted to show you another view point.

Username: /u/bloomberglaw", "preferred": "I had monkeypox 1 month after one dose of the vaccine and ended up taking TPOXX to resolve my severe fevers and some painful ulcers. I read TPOXX can potentially wipe immunity.   Should I get the second shot, if possible?", "rejected": "Since Monkeypox is not necessarily spread through sexual encounters, I and others are nervous because many of the requirements for vaccination are limited to MSM who have sex with multiple partners.  Being in a monogamous queer relationship, to what extent am I at risk for Monkeypox, and should public health entities prioritize vaccination efforts for people like me?"}
{"prompt": "Has anyone used toasted sugar in their recipes?

{"prompt": "CMV: Now would be an opportune time for the U.K. to transition to a republican form of government The  strongest arguments for maintaining the monarchy were the goodwill held  by the Queen, and the fact of her personal integrity.  Upon the sad  news of her passing, it is opportune to transition to republican  government.  The problem with  monarchical government is that it espouses the same evil doctrine that  is at the root of all prejudice, bigotry, racism, and classism: the idea  that by mere accident of birth, one member of a political community is  of greater status than another.  The argument that a ceremonial, as opposed to political, leader is valuable to a country is a good one.  So, for example, in the U.S. the merger of the ceremonial head-of-state role and day-to-day leadership in one man, the President, is problematic.  The U.K. avoided this problem by having a ceremonial head-of-state separate from the politician, the Prime Minister, who managed the government day-to-day and week-to-week.

{"prompt": "Can't figure out recipe for bakery rolls Hi Guys, I've been trying for a long time to re-produce the recipe for some rolls that I get from my local bakery.   They are VERY light and fluffy on the inside, but are crusty on the outside, and crack when pressed (I've included some images below). They are also very light for their size (only 55 grams for the one in the picture).  I've tried using potato starch to get the inside fluffy (which did help, but caused the crust to be chewy - nice but not what I wanted in this case). I've also tried various washes on the rolls before going into the oven (water and egg, neither of which worked out). I've also tried ice in a hot pan to generate steam, this seemed to soften the crust.

{"prompt": "Taking a class on knife skills: Sur La Table or Pro School? I want to up my cooking game, and while I feel like I'm pretty sure I have the basics down (searing, braising, etc), I feel like I could wield my knives a lot better and get faster and more precise at chopping, and learn some more about sharpening (I hone with a steel already). I've watched videos online and practiced, but I'm not that great, so I think taking a proper class is the next logical step.  I looked up classes where I live (New York City), and found the ubiquitous Sur La Table option ($75), but also courses at the Institute of Culinary Education, and International Culinary Center, which are a bit more in cost ($120). I am by no means planning to turn professional, but I do wonder if going the pro route is necessarily the better option (I mean, in the end, both are courses trying to sell you *something*). If anyone knows of any other better options for someone in my position, that suggestion would be appreciated too.   Can anyone offer any advice, experience or input to point me in the right direction? Thanks.   (I hope this is the right place to ask, if not I apologize and ask where that place would be).", "preferred": "While you are working on your knife skills, you should binge watch some knife sharpening videos as well. A sharp knife is a pleasure to use. I watched a couple of videos showing bob Kramer sharpening as well as the burrfection channel.", "rejected": "It's all about repetition, man. Watch many YouTube videos on various techniques and practice, practice, practice. Potatoes are cheap and abundant enough that you need not feel bad throwing them away. Onions are more expensive but require specific techniques- they can be diced and then frozen on a sheet tray, then transferred to freezer bags and used in any cooked application. To practice julienning them, make some caramelized onions- they cook down so much that you'll get a decent practice session in just making one batch. To practice difficult, extremely small cuts like brunoise (perfect 1/16\" cubes, just about as small as you can possibly cut), do a 2:2:1 (measured after cutting) mix of turnips, carrots and leeks- they can be blanched separately, drained, then frozen in the same manner as described for diced onions and used in sauces or as a garnish. You'll also get plenty of julienning practice in the process.  Cutting bell peppers is something where going pro really gives you an advantage- at upwards of $5 a pop, getting to practice on entire cases of peppers is a privelege. Still, the technique of coring peppers by \"unrolling\" them on the cutting board isn't THAT difficult and if you're proficient in other knife skills, should only take a few peppers to get comfortable enough to do it in front of others without feeling like a dunce.  I think classes are a waste of time and money- just keep cooking, keep researching techniques, and find what's best and most comfortable for you. Take care of your knives- just a steel isn't enough, get a waterstone and learn how to use it. Don't send them to a pro to sharpen them, even as a serious home cook, they will need to be sharpened far too often to be cost effective, and you will find yourself working with sub-par equipment until you can be arsed to send your knives out. It isn't rocket science like some people try to make it sound, muscle memory is a powerful thing."}

When I bake for other people I always do my best to cater to their tastes, even (especially) if they aren't mine. Instead of adding coffee, I would add cinnamon, which has a similar but not as deep effect.

{"prompt": "CMV: People who are against an extensive welfare/social program because they won\u2019t benefit from it are selfish and not very bright.  Generally speaking, I don\u2019t think highly of most people who are against welfare/social programs, but the argument that makes the least sense to me is the \u201cmy money shouldn\u2019t go towards something that doesn\u2019t benefit me/I shouldn\u2019t have to pay more for someone else to get xy\u201d.  For the sake of this argument let\u2019s ignore that helping the less fortunate has a positive effect on society and thus benefits all members as they clearly don\u2019t believe that.  According to the dictionary, selfish means \u201clacking consideration for other people; concerned chiefly with one's own personal profit or pleasure\u201d, so I think it\u2019s pretty clear that the people who think along these lines are selfish.  I also think that they are not the smartest either, as a selfish but logical person would see that the best option for them is to have the security of an available and accessible welfare network even if they won\u2019t need it. Let\u2019s look at the options:  A. *There is no welfare system in place and you would\u2019ve needed it.* Clearly a bad situation.  B. *There is no welfare system in place and you never end up needing it.* Congratulations, you were lucky. However, you lived your life knowing that your luck might not hold and you\u2019re just one unexpected event away from being in a situation where you could have benefited from a safety net. You had an accident/got sick and now you\u2019re disabled/can\u2019t work? Too bad. You found out you\u2019re pregnant but can\u2019t afford to raise the child as a single parent? Tough luck. You were on a family trip, got in a car crash, and now your child is an orphan? Sucks to be them. There was an earthquake and everything you own is destroyed? Hope you don\u2019t mind.  C. *There is a welfare system in place and you end up needing it.* It\u2019s great that there was help available but it sucks that you fell on hard times. Not an ideal situation.  D. *There is a welfare system in place and you never end up needing it.* Most ideal situation. You lived a relatively comfortable life with the added reassurance that, were something to change, you wouldn\u2019t be on your own.  **Thus, my view is that on top of being selfish, they are not the smartest either as, all other things being equal, having the safety net of social welfare and not needing it is the best/most logical option.**  Ideally, I would like my view changed on both aspects, but proving that they are either not selfish or smart is also ok.  Arguments that I heard before/won\u2019t change my mind:  *People are responsible for their own lives/they should have prepared/they should have been more responsible/etc*. I\u2019m not talking about rich people who can fall back on their money/their family\u2019s money. In reality, most average people are one tragedy away from homelessness/poverty/hardship. I wish I could find that reddit post where the guy was explaining how it took 5 months after his wife\u2019s cancer diagnosis to lose 20 years' worth of savings and to have to remortgage their home. Basically, you can do everything right and still find yourself in a difficult position.  *There is/could be an option E in which such systems/programs are not needed to begin with.* I don\u2019t think that\u2019s plausible.  *Option B is preferable over D for said people because the possibility of their own misfortune bothers them less than the idea of someone else benefiting from their taxes.* This just proves that they are selfish and dumb for thinking that it\u2019s a good idea to sink the ship they are on just so the captain drowns.  *Option B is the best for them because they are not worried/they don\u2019t think it possible that they could be in the shoes of the less fortunate.* That just shows a total lack of empathy and awareness, assuming that just because they don\u2019t need it now, they\u2019ll never need it in the future proves they are not smart.  I also would prefer it, if your argument wouldn\u2019t be over semantics. English is not my first language so do let me know if something is unclear.", "preferred": "The way you have framed it you are focusing only on a selfish objection and ignoring other concerns' so yes by your own criteria selfish people are selfish.   The 'stupid' element though is a changeable view.   > a selfish but logical person would see that the best option for them is to have the security of an available and accessible welfare network even if they won\u2019t need it.  This is ignoring the cost of that security. It is like saying anyone who doesn't have insurance is stupid' when they might assess it as the cost of paying a monthly premium for a service they are unlikely to need is not worth the potential payout. That they would be better saving their money to cover an unexpected cost than paying for something that might not happen. I dont pay for phone insurance- I dont consider the cost/benefit worth it. Whether you agree or not that isn't an implicitly stupid stance to take.   When viewing this issue purely selfishly' it is an issue of risk analysis and cost/benefit. Someone in a secure position may not consider protecting against a low risk worth the cost. Using your examples' in scenario B/D their assessment was correct and purely selfishly they were correct to not want to finance a welfare system they didn't use. If you consider the peace of mind D has better than the lack of expense B has that's a valid stance' but I would not dismiss someone as stupid for valuing thw lower cost over peace of mind.", "rejected": "People who want welfare programs are also selfish.

{"prompt": "How to thank your Vet? Our 2y M Goldador Gus decided to dry his insides with a towel, and we have had an extremely stressful week. A 2am visit to the emergency Vet, and they suggested pancreatitis. I wasn't convinced and requested an anti-emetic and sub-cut pain relief to last the 5 hours until my Vet opened.   Imaging confirmed a bowel obstruction and surgery ensued, with 1 length of towel from his stomach, through the length of his colon and well into his bowel. During this time he regurgitated and aspirated. He was hung off the table and the Vet was very concerned.   https://imgur.com/a/WrrgHWe  He was on the mend at home until yesterday morning when he was showing signs of infection. He had actually been seen by a Vet the previous afternoon and everything was progressing well. I work in the medical field, and got him to the Vet, fearing sepsis.   The staff at the vet have been incredible. They closed in the afternoon, with a vet and nurse staying with him until the vet went home after 9pm, the nurse did a 14 hour shift and swapped with another vet at midnight. The same nurse was back at 4am to swap again. This is not a 24 hour clinic.   They let my wife and I hang around with our dog, and we got him walking and urinating. All three of us were comforted by being allowed to be there.   While hanging around, I chatted with the Vet about my admiration for their role. They had experienced a very difficult day, with a routine surgery resulting in the loss of a dog. I understand resuscitation of this animal went for a number of hours and was unexpected by all. The vet was very upset by it.   My field of work has a long and dark history of suicide and mental health conditions, but we have coping mechanisms - both formal and informal. We also enjoy very defined relationships with our patients with the relationship starting and ending over the course of 1 - 2 hours. The impact of our role is still too much for many people.   I cannot fathom how hard vets and vet staff have it.   Clinics are either small with a limited number of practitioners, with long and drawn out relationships with patients who can't talk and owners who can't seem to listen. It's not like there is a bar that vets get to hang out in and debrief. They go home and think about their ongoing cases and get up in the middle of the night to continue working on them. It must be lonely and it must be consuming.   I understand the risks with my boy, and that's why I was so quick to get him back to care when his situation changed. My dogs are my world, and a big part of my coping mechanisms for dealing with my work related stressors. It doesn't matter if it is 3pm or 3am when I walk through the door... I always get greeted with love. When I am in a dark place, I have 2 labs ready to retrieve me. I can't express what loosing one unexpectedly would do to me.

Question popped into my head when I saw an article about a new BQ.1 subvariant", "preferred": "What you\u2019re asking is why, at first, the new variants arose from the same starting point, while now the new variants are arising from each other. In other words they started off by going   * A  -> B  * A  -> C * A  -> D  whereas now they are going  * D -> E -> F -> G  In these scenarios, B, C, and D would be what you\u2019re calling \u201cvariants\u201d, and E, F, and G are \u201csubvariants\u201d. (This is greatly simplified, of course.).   The big picture answer is that those are the best-adapted viruses. As to why the best adaptations happened this particular way, it\u2019s partly speculation, but it\u2019s probably because the unusual nature of omicron gives it *and its variants* a transmission advantage over the other paths that could be followed.   Omicron almost certainly arose in an immunocompromised person - perhaps someone with partially controlled HIV, for example. The person had antibodies against the infecting virus, but wasn\u2019t able to completely eliminate the infection (perhaps because they didn\u2019t have enough active T cells). That gives the infecting virus a very strong selection for avoiding antibodies, so it accumulates a whole range of mutations.    What\u2019s more, this virus arose in an increasingly immune world - not so much because of vaccination (it arose in an almost non-vaccinated population) but because of prior infection. That gave omicron an enormous transmission advantage over all the previous variants, that didn\u2019t have as many mutations and were less able to deal with population immunity.   (As a side note, since vaccination gives better immunity than infection, the rise of omicron could possibly have been prevented if vaccine companies and developed countries had overcome their greed and selfishness and lived up to the agreements they\u2019d made to deliver vaccines to the whole world.)  Now, new mutations arising in omicron family members are able to build on the backbone that each previous mutation has accumulated. This is the pattern we see with influenza, for example - a series of accumulating mutations, finally culminating in one variant that has a distinct transmission advantage over the others that takes over and then itself starts to accumulate new mutations.", "rejected": "I think it's super important to keep in mind that the virus isn't creating anything. It isn't intending anything. It's merely evolving. Omicron is the fittest variant (evolutionarily) and so it should be no surprise it's hanging around - that's what you should expect to happen when a plurality of the population decides they're going to do everything they can to give the virus a willing host population.  Within Omicron, there are variants that are of the same type, but not identical. You might think if it as members of the same family. They're not the same, but the relationship - that is, the heritable similarities - is a simple matter to discern. My understanding is that variants and subvariants are a matter of how the spike protein (the bit of the virus that binds to human cells) has changed to better cross the cellular membrane to replicate itself.  There's nothing stopping new variants from emerging; it's just that the most successful variants at the moment all are related."}

First I would ask about WHAT YOUR DELIVERABLES ARE. Ask for as much of a specific/detailed deliverable. (ex: increase first pas yields by 8% in year one). Simply put, in ONE sentence, do you know what your BOSS/CEO, hired you for?  2. if no, figure it out... follow up with the CURRENT STATE. In all the disorder, there is some order of which they get things done, start by letting your boss/management know that you will spend a few weeks (or months depending on the organization), understanding what the current state is.  Note, this should be done first on your deliverables, or it can become too big. (Ex: what is the current first pass yield? Is it accurate, how do we measure it? Is there historical data? What does it say? if they can't answer these simple questions it's okay, it's the foundation. It DOESN\"T MATTER WHAT IS ON PAPER, IT'S WHAT IS ACTUALLY THE CURRENT STATE (who cares if they say they have 97% first pass yield, if they're not even recording it, so they can't verify it, they don't know) 3. Clearly define your current problem. Yes again. 4. Verify that is the problem you are going to solve... again, with your stakeholder, 5. Ask yourself again, is this really the current state, and is this really the problem I'm solving.  If so, you have your baseline. 6. Okay, if 1000000% on number 5, the rest might come easy. Do a Root cause analysis (use fish.bone, parretto... etc.) Start with solving the biggest impact root cause First. 7. One change at a time... your low hanging fruits are best also, as long as you are solving root cause 8. implement the new \"solution\" for the SPECIFIC ROOT CAUSE. BEWARE: WATCH IT LIKE IT'S A PREMATURE BABY ON LIFE SUPPORT. FOCUS ON CAREFULLY OVERLY WATCHING YOUR IMPLEMENTED \"SOLUTION\" Specifically, it doesn't matter what change you make, if people don't follow it... make it easy to follow, how?? LET THEM TELL YOU HOW THEY WILL FIX THE DEFINED PROBLEM, let them OWN their solution, this is called BUY-IN. The document, and analyze what happened with those change, think, is this solving the problem? creating more problems?  9. if you can sustain it for a probably/normally 90 days then you should have solved your issues, and gotten results, that are measurable. The controlling part is more on validation and verification that the solution works, and a new current state... which if out of control, you should have a \"what to do process\" if it's not.  Repeat,  and repeat.... the number one thing I would say is, if you're not going to deliver what THEY want, value added or not, then you are not fixing their problem. once you deliver what they want, slowly, you will gain respect/credibility and hopefully freedom to address other more cultural change, but only if you plan on being there 5-10 years (no joke)   &#x200B;  Good luck, and God Speed", "rejected": "You don't..."}

{"prompt": "New landlord hates privacy. Help I recently found myself needing a month to month lease for between six months to 14 months in Baltimore, which I was unfamiliar with.  The apartment I found is a small efficiency in an older building.  They agreed to a standard lease for the first six months, followed by month to month lease.  I was to be the first tenant, when I toured it six weeks ago, workers were painting the rooms.  The landlords son is living upstairs, and this is my landlords first time renting.  The lease was obviously pulled from a form and seemed standard.  There is a clause in the lease which states that I can't install curtains rods or hooks.  This seemed standard as well, I had similar at my old apartment.  I assumed there would be some sort of curtain provided, and this was in regards to additional curtains.  I moved in Sunday, and found the landlord had not installed curtains at all.  At this point, I assumed the issue with curtains was the potential to damage to the wall.  So, I bought tension rods that require no hardware and used them to hang curtains.  Monday afternoon I got a text from my landlord saying I needed to remove the curtains.  The building is on a street corner with a fair amount of foot traffic.  Between the four windows, you can see all of my apartment with the exception of the portion of the bathroom with the toilet and tub.  Not only does this mean I have no privacy, but the neighborhood is slightly sketchy after dark.  The nearby buildings have bars on their windows.  Anyone passing by not only can see my possessions, but whether or not I am home.  I expressed this to the landlord in my reply over text.  He replied to reread my lease.  I left them up overnight.  I had orientation this morning and came back to find the curtains removed and no where in the apartment.  I discovered this before entering the building, as two guys were outside one of my windows and looking in my apartment.  They left when I entered the building.  I messaged the landlord saying he didn't have the right to enter the apartment and asked for the curtains back.  He again said to check my lease and then commented that I needed to finish unpacking as it looked messy in my apartment.  I had to head to a work event so I couldn't follow through more, but I moved my electronics to one corner and used a bookshelf to block one of the windows so they weren't visible.  While at the event, I got a text from the landlord with a picture of the blocked window, captioned \"whatts this\"  What can I do to prevent my landlord from entering the apartment unannounced and to compel him to allow some form of curtain?

{"prompt": "CMV: The recent move by Dems to gerrymander blue states to a similar degree as their opposition is a net negative change for America To preface I am not a Dem but I have never voted for a Republican. I hate both parties but I hate one party significantly more. Here are my primary concerns. There are *individuals* in both parties that I agree with on certain policies (again, nearly all Dems and Independents) but that's about it.  1. Gerrymandering is bad for numerous reasons including unfairness and being anti-democratic. 2. This move entrenches the tactic in state and federal politics. Whereas previously at least Dems had motivation to eliminate partisan gerrymandering via legislation since they are now approximately equal beneficiaries (or will be if they keep it up) they will likely stop fighting to eliminate it. 3. This policy allows non-Dems to declare \u201cboth sides\u201d with validity on this issue (whereas previously it was not a valid argument as it was clear the GOP gerrymandered worse/more). 4. Overall, this represents a stalemate at state levels where now we have a set of deep red or deep blue states which will essentially be locked into their political affiliations permanently. This will increase corruption in those states as there will be no political recourse (the voters no longer matter).  I'm mostly open to changing my view on this in the direction of \"this isn't that bad\" because I feel like this is one of the final nails in the plurality voting democratic republic coffin.

You're arguing that the best system would be no gerrymandering at all.  And I would largely agree with you.  But given the way that Republicans have made nationally coordinated efforts to gerrymander over the last decade plus, and the benefits they have reaped from that, I don't see them voluntarily changing.  So if we're taking it as fait accompli that at least one party will be gerrymandering where they have the opportunity, then what are the possible outcomes?  Outcome #1 is that Republicans gerrymander and Democrats don't (or at the very least gerrymander to a lesser extent).  Outcome #2 is both parties gerrymander.  Which outcome is better?  In the former, there is less gerrymandering, but it likely results in a less fair map (e.g. see the 2012 House of Representatives Election, where Congressional Republicans won a majority of seats despite Democrats winning a majority of votes).  In the latter, there is more gerrymandering, but at least the negative effects of the process are working to balance themselves out to some effect.  I agree that a more fair system would be to prevent gerrymandering, but when gerrymandering is allowed unilateral disarmament is surefire way to allow groups who are willing to pursue such problematic tactics to gain power and further prevent change from happening.", "rejected": "This move is not recent.   Now gerrymandering might be bad, the solutions might be worse, these are fine things to talk about.  But the idea that democrats doing this is a recent thing is just laughable."}

Companies would pay their workers more, those workers would use this money to buy more products, money would flow more consistently through the economy, and more wealth creating transactions would occur.  On the other hand, if instead of seeing this as a possible outcome these large companies do outsource all the jobs, the economy would stagnate because the largest consumer base in the country (working class) would be largely unemployed and there would be nobody to buy these products except the Chinese children getting paid 10 cents an hour to make the damn things."}

What tips could you give to excel in the finer side of cooking?", "preferred": "Fine dining chef here. I've posted a few times before about the fundamental differences between restaurant cooking and home cooking and how a home cook can elevate their quality and execution.   * Learn proper technique- Jacques P\u00e9pin's New Complete Techniques is a great starting point. Its a progressive teaching tool with an emphasis on foundation techniques with lots of photos. Follow up with his is old KQED/PBS shows that are available on Youtube for free. For the advanced version, CIA's The Professional Chef will broaden horizons when it comes to product identification, breaking down proteins, and more advanced techniques.  * Learn the underlying principles of the science of food- Harold McGee's On Food & Cooking is the OG book that is on the shelf of every chef I know. If you're into video and lectures, Harvard's food science lecture series is on Youtube for free. The more you understand how food cooks, the easier it is to tackle more complex dishes.  * Start to develop intuitive cooking by eating a variety of cuisines and learning what goes with what. When culinary students ask me how to develop a better palate my advice is simply just eat as varied cuisines as you can afford. The Flavour Bible is also a great resource for what goes with what.  * Up your plating game by understanding plating concepts of colour, contrast, construction, and composition. This is a major difference with how home cooks approach a dish vs. a professional. r/culinaryplating is also a great place to learn.  * Some general tips and tricks learned when working in a fast paced kitchen.  * Sometimes quality tools count-  a good knife and learning how to take care of it is a game changer. r/chefknives has a great wiki and getting started guide. Good knife skills will make cooking go 90% faster. A consistent julienne is going to look better and cook more consistently than a pile of matchsticks of varying size.  * A lot of the time why a restaurant dish is superior is access to high quality, artisanal ingredients. Not essential to fine dining across the board but we're often working with a butcher who is custom aging steaks, day boat fish deliveries, etc. that are difficult for the home cook to access. You can still make a great dish using regular products with fundamentals and complexity that will get you closer to fine dining.  * Tackling more complex and heavy prep dishes found in fine dining will be aided by good habits-  mise en place and clean as you go. Organising your work environment is the key to being efficient with your labour and time in a kitchen. For example, when I am prepping, I have three bowls- 1] for uprepped product, 2] for scrap, 3] for finished prep. Think ahead, combine steps where you can. Clean as you go means get rid of scrap, re-use that bowl, wipe down, organise used tools, don't be a disaster child who has seventeen dirty spoons and flour everywhere once you put something in the oven and crack open a beer.   * Use recipes from known sources to improve your cooking. While videos can be helpful for understanding steps, cookbooks, while not always error free, have been tested and edited with a review process lacking in other sources. Pick a chef whose food is the style you are looking to work with and source one of their books. Many libraries have great line ups of cookbooks so you can rent before you own.", "rejected": "Check out the Eleven Madison Park cook book.

{"prompt": "What are my options if my advisor prevents me from graduating? Seeking advice in r/GradSchool as well, but hoping to get insight here from some faculty members.  I'm a thesis track Master's student currently in my 3rd year (6th semester). I was supposed to graduate last semester but delayed to this semester to give me more time to process data and perform analyses. My progress has been significantly slowed by unforeseen analytical issues, but mostly my advisor has been incredibly distant. I'm not looking for validation on that front - I've already had multiple discussions with my department's administration (including the chair) about my experiences, and they've all been appalled at how I've been treated. For the rest of the post, please keep that in mind.  I have 90% of my first chapter written, but my advisor is now floating the idea of me graduating in the summer or fall instead of this spring. They are concerned they may not have enough time to review my drafts before I defend in mid-April. They do not have any more funding for me, so they'd force me to pay my university's fees to stay a student while I finish up. However, I already have a job lined up that does not care about my degree, and I care way more about the work I'm doing with them than I care about my Master's. If I do not graduate this semester, that job immediately takes priority for me. I already plan on being very open about how my priorities will shift.  So, what are my options if my advisor wants to delay my defense?  1. I could go along with the delay and put the bare minimum into finishing up. This would cost me roughly $1,000 per semester. I am not a fan of this option. 2. I could attempt to force them to let me defend and graduate by threatening to quit altogether. I am my PI's first student, and two other students have already quit on top of misuse of university funds. If I leave, my PI will likely have to wait another 2.5 years for a student to graduate and produce any papers. That's 6 years of being a tenure-track professor with no students graduated or publications or presentations from their work. My advisor is incredibly vulnerable. 3. I could switch advisors and go with a non-thesis track degree. This would likely forfeit any publications with my current advisor or our collaborators. My entire thesis is based on a collaboration with a government agency, and our partner at that agency is on my committee. That committee member has been incredibly supportive and understanding, but I doubt I could publish with just them with our data. This option would also still result in a major delay in my graduation. 4. I could quit altogether.  I am incredibly frustrated at the moment and thinking somewhat irrationally, but I feel like I am being abused. For my own mental health, I need to be done as soon as possible, and I am very close to prioritizing my own wellbeing over a piece of paper.

Taking two and a half months to review two chapters seems ridiculous, and it sounds to me like they're just dragging you along and denying you funding so they can get more work done through you. I'm sorry this is happening, OP, but if you already have a job lined up that excites you and doesn't depend on your degree, this seems like the best option to save you money, time, and more importantly your mental health."}
{"prompt": "In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, I\u2019ve seen a lot about the differences in how a fetus is perceived by the Jewish faith tradition as opposed to Christianity. Where did this split come from, theologically? Perhaps just anecdotal evidence, but after the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe, I saw quite a few posts on social media about how the decision infringes on the religious liberties of Jews, since that faith tradition views a fetus as part of the mother and thus does not have the same ideological opposition to abortion as, say, evangelical Christians.   Leaving aside of validity of the political/legal argument, I\u2019m curious as the theological divide in perception. Where did this come from? Or am I way off base?", "preferred": "My answer will try to address the historical perception of a fetus, rather than the criminality of abortion, but there will be some overlap. To maintain neutrality, I'll use the more legal \"fetus/foeticide\" and \"natural person/homicide\". I'm also strictly examining historical interpretations of theology, not modern theology, or my own.  I'll mostly address changes in \"mainstream\" Jewish perception, because I'm not familiar enough with Christian apocrypha.  As a benchmark, by the 6th century, the Talmud(s) had been compiled to form the basis of Rabbinic Judaism. It is not a primary source, but explicitly stated that a fetus, whilst of great value, was not equivalent to the mother's life because it was \"part of the mother\" and not an individual, animate natural person. It distinguished between the \"moment of conception\" and the \"moment of determination\", that up until 40 days a fetus was \"like water\". It explicitly established a monetary fine as punishment for foeticide.  The Talmud includes a 3rd century source citing a 2nd century source (Rav Meir) saying that only once the fetus crowned, it was considered an \"animate being\" and its soul of equal value to the mother.  Question answered, right? Well no, the divergence may have occurred earlier.  The main theological issue stems from the interpretation of a specific passage from Exodus:  This passage only refers to miscarriage induced by a deliberate altercation. There are four *historical* points of contention here:  * The translation of the word *ason*, as harm/damage/calamity. * The interpretation of \"soul for soul, eye for eye\". * The interpretation of the victim of \"other damage\". * The influence of other scriptures on its overall interpretation.  From a literal perspective, there's a separation between foeticide and \"other damage\". But your question is on the theological perception of a fetus throughout history, not abortion.  The Babylonian Code of Hammurabi (c 1750 BCE) stated something similar, punishing foeticide with a fine, but the death of the mother as a capital crime. This was mirrored by other empires (except the Assyrians, who punished self-inflicted abortion with impalement). This doesn't tell us how they *perceived* a fetus, only that they considered killing a fetus different to killing a natural person.  This is where it gets complicated. The historicity of the Torah is a bit of a minefield: here's one AskHistorians thread, here's another. In addition, there's no clear consensus on when the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) canon became fixed. In case you're not Jewish, the Written Torah is only one part of Tanakh, and the Tanakh's interpretation is based on commentaries that vary throughout history (more on this later).  This complicates things further, because translations differ from each other. The Septuagint (Koine Greek translation of the Pentateuch, c. 3rd-2nd century BCE) and some targumim (Aramaic translations of oral works) were written to imply *ason* applied to the fetus, not the mother.  Why does this matter? **Because the Septuagint initially translated** ***ason*** **as form, not damage!** This leads to the translation: \"if \\[there is\\] full form, then you shall give life for life\" (\u1f10\u1f70\u03bd \u03b4\u1f72 **\u1f10\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u1f73\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd** \u1f26\u03bd, \u03b4\u1f7d\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u1f74\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u1f76 \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u1fc6\u03c2). Later Christian scholars corrected this to \"harm\".  Philo (1st century BCE) and Josephus (1st century CE), as I mention in a comment to another answer, made distinctions between killing an unformed/formed fetus and an infant. Philo relied on the Septuagint for his translations, and Philo and Josephus both follow the Septuagint's translation for this particular passage.  The influence of the Septuagint and Hellenistic Judaism is considerable - even though it differed from the original Hebrew (in some cases considerably) it was used by Jews who couldn't speak Hebrew during the Second Temple period, and by the earliest non-Jewish Christians. It isn't clear if its usage was universal amongst Hellenic Jews. Jews later discarded the Septuagint by the 2nd century CE for Hebrew or Aramaic scriptures. By the 4th century CE, the Septuagint contained inserted Christian apocrypha that weren't present in the original.  Both Philo and Josephus are representative of Judaeo-Hellenic and Judaeo-Roman syncretism - they wrote their texts as assimilated members of Greek and Roman society. Their interpretations therefore are not necessarily representative of mainstream interpretations of *Hebrew* texts at the time.  It is also why Philo, an Alexandrian Jew, considered abortion a capital crime, but Josephus who would have been raised under the Palestinian school, does not: the phrase \"soul for a soul, eye for an eye\" for example, is usually interpreted in Hebrew texts as a pecuniary punishment, rather than a literal one. This aligns with the idea that Philo - whose grasp of Hebrew was poor - considered abortion a capital crime (life for life), but Josephus did not.  Remember how the Torah is one part of the Tanakh? Well, the Tanakh is interpreted using the Oral Torah, which was transmitted orally until 70CE. The major compilations of the Oral Torah  weren't written down until \\~200CE, and weren't finalised until the 6th century. This makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact date of theological divergence. But there are clues.  The first clue is the concept that preserving life overrides all other commandments *except* homicide (and a few other things). The first explicit Talmudic reference to this cites Samuel of Nehardea (2nd-3rd century), but there are biblical references that predate it.  The other clues are sections of the Oral Torah with detailed explanations on the status of a fetus. In the Tractate Bekhorot, Rav Chisda (3-4th century) is cited as saying it takes 40 days for a fetus to form. The distinction between formed and unformed that Philo and Josephus made is no longer mentioned.  Another Talmudic source stated that before, a fetus is \"like water\". Likewise, a deceased fetus was said to not impart the same ritual impurity as a person's corpse.  The Mishnah Oholot (3rd century, but quoting a source from \\~150CE) allows surgical abortion to save the life of the mother up until crowning. Since homicide was not a permissible reason to save a person's life, a fetus could not have been considered a person.  Assuming (and it is an assumption) that the Mishnah Oholot is correctly citing a century-old source, that narrows it down to before the 2nd century. The question now is what happened before the Mishnah was written down?  Well, that goes back to the Septuagint's translation in the 3rd century BCE. Given the widespread use of the Septuagint, Hellenised Jews who didn't speak Hebrew were usually raised under the Alexandrian school and therefore used different texts to other Jews who followed the Palestinian school.  That's the origin of the divergence, which would have been codified in Christian theology given that non-Hebrew speaking Christians could only have read the Septuagint. I can't say if this divergence was universal within the Alexandrian school.  Regardless, by the final compilation of the Mishnah in the 3rd century and the rest of the Talmud in the 6th century, Rabbinic Judaism did not consider a fetus to be a fully-fledged \"animate being\", but part of the mother.  By the 11th century onwards, the word *ason* was considered to apply to the mother rather than the fetus. Later scholars from the 11th century onwards concretised this further by considering a fetus as \"not a person\", and then by considering a fetus to be an \"aggressor\" for endangering the life of the mother.  So there you have it. A word, translated differently in the 3rd century BCE, was the basis for the theological divide on the status of a fetus.  EDIT: Spelling. Corrections from mod remarks. Added Koine Greek.", "rejected": "In the Greco-Roman world in the first three centuries CE, under the influence of customary pagan belief and practice, abortion and the abandonment of unwanted infants was commonplace, and not terribly controversial. These two acts were also identified with one another as generally a single practice. There were pagan critics of the practice, notably Cicero in his defense of Aulus Cluentius Habitus. And there is some debate as to whether the practice was more seen as a \"regrettable necessity\", in the words of McCulloch, or was seen callously as a routine part of life. But in either case, the widespread practice of abortion and infant-killing was a widely-understood fact of life in the pre-Christian Mediterranean.  Jews, however, seem to have rejected this practice from at least the 2nd or 1st century BCE, (if not much earlier), and this discrepancy did not go unnoticed by their Greek neighbors. Tacitus notes (Chapter 5) that they consider killing infants to be a crime. He does not consider this to be a compliment, and lists this custom among others he calls \"base and abominable\". Whether or not he is correct in his assertion that Jews categorically considered it unlawful, it certainly speaks volumes that he considered it a barbaric trait for them to do so.  As to if and when abortion, as a procedure performed prior to natural birth, became divested from this broader concept in Jewish law, I will leave to another commenter, but from my research and understanding of Mediterranean late-antiquity, it was not yet so distinguished.  Christianity, in the first several centuries of its existence, as you're probably aware, experienced an acute identity crisis between its Hebrew and Greek cultural heritage. Many early Christian writers, such as Tertullian, the author of the Epistle to Barnabas, and the author(s) of the Didache, (to name a few), all embraced their Greek inheritance. They insisted that one could be a Hellene and a Christian, and indeed that the titans of Hellenic Philosophy comported with Christian teachings. However, despite the fact that these authors were happy to underline their Hellenic character, and did not at all seek to emulate Jewish culture and practice wholesale, even these Greek-leaning Christians broke radically with their pagan kinsmen on the question of abortion, and accepted the Jewish custom of considering it to be both a sin and a crime.  All early Christian communities abhorred abortion and infant-killing, and Jewish sentiment too was consistently opposed to it - Josephus and Philo both expressly forbade it. The Didache, the Apocalypse of Peter/Apocalypses/The_Apocalypse_of_Peter), and the Apolegoticum, are examples of early Christian writings that also expressly forbade it.  In short, for the first several centuries of their co-existence, Judaism and Christianity were in accord. They considered infant-killing to be a crime, and they considered invasive abortion prior to birth as the same thing. Polemics between Jews, Jewish Christians, and Hellenic Christians tend to obscure areas of alignment, but it's clear that from the perspective of the outsider - the pagan Greco-Roman - Christians and Jews shared the same position at least until the fourth century.  For more information on how early Christian communities distinguished themselves from Hellenic society, and in what ways they accommodated themselves, see *The self-defining praxis of the developing ecclsesia* by Carolyn Ostek, published as Chapter 14 of The Cambridge History of Christianity, edited by Mitchell and Young.  For more information on the practice of infant killing, infant abandonment, and abortion in antiquity (and beyond), see *The Kindness of Strangers* by John Boswell. Excellent work.  I also consulted *Christianity - The First Three Thousand Years* by Diarmaid McColluch, specifically Chapter 4, \"Boundaries Defined\"."}

Similarly the police force would be clear on what laws they can and can't enforce and why - removing police power trips or at least significantly reducing them, as they can be held accountable.

This might not even be possible given the vast range of scenarios that would need to be covered.  If they did manage to write a legal code that covered all factors, it would be so convoluted that even the best lawyers would struggle to make sense of it.  It would easily result in a situation where a single case could take years to sort out because that's how long it takes to follow the flow charts and no one will really understand at the end what law they would be arguing needs to be changed if they want to.  Then, there is the fact that even under such a system, people would still have the right to argue that they constitute an edge case.  Even if the court decides they are not, they still have the right to argue that idea.  So, people who want to take their case to court instead of pleading out will still have that happen.  It will just make the legal arguments harder to understand for anyone who isn't a lawyer.  Another issue is this ruins the ability of regulations to be quickly adaptable.  In our current system, we have both laws and regulations.  Regulations are things that are enforced like laws but aren't actually laws.  Instead, a law will be passed giving an agency the authority to write regulations on a particular subject matter.  This allows for those regulations to be changed rapidly based on changing situations.  For many people, the difference doesn't actually affect them but for many industries getting decisions made at an agency level instead of through the legislature is critical for making things happen in a timely fashion.  Having a legislature vote setting fishing bag limits (for example) is a quick way to just not have any fish left.  Finally, many criminal cases that go to court aren't actually arguing over legal philosophy.  Instead, they have a disagreement on the very facts of the case.  It doesn't matter how clear the law is for a given situation if it is unclear what the situation is.  Inflexible laws don't help when the confusion comes not from the law but from the facts.

I used to always think to myself \"wow, I wonder what game devs will do with such amazing technology. Surely the games will be as good or better than the 90s right?\"  Wrong.  Instead, they are just all horribly designed and executed - and that's even just ignoring the major issue already mentioned; all of the ads and paywalls. The ads and paywalls might be acceptable *if* the games didn't suck in the first place.  The only thing that has arguably improved in mobile games is graphics (duh). But this just goes to show how unimportant graphics are to make a truly amazing gaming experience.   Okay. I'm ready to have my view changed. Feel free to suggest any mobile game for iOS that I haven't tried.", "preferred": "The thing is for games on mobile there is a different market strategy. Installing an app on a phone is very easy and you can do it while relaxing with something else, users are more likely to just try a few and stop using it if it's not that interesting in the beginning. So companies don't have upfront payment, so they have to monetize in other ways and making cheap cash grabs has unfortunately become the norm.   However there is a *huge* volume of games available on android and iOS. Personally I've been playing arknights for the past couple of years now, a tower defense gacha game with a great story. It's graphics are simple 2d stuff but it makes up for it with interesting challenging gameplay and excellent world and character building.  It's up to you to find the good games, it's quite a bit harder on mobile since there's a lot more trash and its not like there are game focused market places like steam but that doesn't mean there aren't some decent games, though you should keep in mind the different focuses of the mediums, where and how mobile games are played differs from PC means that companies make games with different focuses.", "rejected": "I enjoy a various bunch of mobile games that were pc/console only at some point:  -Minecraft  -Roblox  -Grand Theft Auto Ports  -Final Fantasy Ports  -The TellTales Series  -Professor Layton Series   You get the point. It's true that a bunch of mobile games are trash, but feel like that's more in tune with the \"free to play\" apps because they lean very heavily on microtransactions to survive on games that have poor production value to begin with.  I hope you can find a mobile game that you can enjoy, because theres a bunch of them out there. :)"}

In a less humid environment the rate of evaporation will be greater, and therefore the cooling effect will also be greater.   This is why a dry heat feels less intense, because the less humid environment makes our bodies self cooling method (sweat which evaporates) more effective.", "rejected": "Serious add-on question.

In general, people who think other ways of looking at problems are foolish, instead of different, and anyone who disparages a different level of analysis or approach (as long as it is still valid) is kind of a douche.   Asking how things work in a different field  isn't being insecure .  Nor is admitting you don't know something.

{"prompt": "Neighbors house burned down, our home owners association is demanding that we take care and clean up the property by next Monday, or we are going to be fined for negligence. I was told to post this here by my son. We own a home in a HOA in New York State. We had a few problems with our HOA in the past, but this is beyond anything I have ever dealt with.  About 3 weeks ago there was a fire and our neighbors house was heavily damaged by fire, i am not privy to the details of the fire, but the house was apparently written off. Last week the remains still standing were bulldozed for safety reasons. However most of the actual remains were pilled up. I was expecting them to remove it, but they have not. I don't really know what is going on with it at all.  Tonight our HOA came to our house to tell us we are shirking our HOA duties as their lot is a mess. Our HOA president is arguing that both me and the other adjacent neighbor are responsible for the upkeep of any vacant dwellings.  This is what they are arguing:  \"In the event of a unit being unoccupied with no clear owner. It is the responsibility of any adjacent units to perform any required upkeep to ensure the vacant unit is up to the community standards....(insert reference to our bylaws regarding how stuff is supposed to look)\".  Our HOA more or less wants us to remove all the debris, fix the lawn etc. I have so many issues with this, firstly it is not safe at all. Secondly i don't know who owns the plot now. According to our HOA the original owners took the insurance money and are moving somewhere else. So wouldn't that mean the insurance company owns the land and not us?  We have until May 17th, to apparently get this done otherwise we will be fined. Am I crazy or does this seem idiotic?", "preferred": "Someone owns the property, you can just check the deed record to figure out who that is.

If it\u2019s built in, do humans have anything comparable?", "preferred": "Birds (especially the more social ones) learn proper nest building from their parents and other birds, but probably have an innate instinct to build nests.   Spiders, I'm not sure about.   Species in the order of Hymenoptera, like bees and ants generally have very specific, but relatively simple instructions to build their nests. The giant complex nests are an emergent property from those simple, instinctual rules interacting with the environment.", "rejected": "For honeybees, it\u2019s programmed in. They all follow the same rules when they\u2019re building cooperatively, and things mostly work out.  The only thing we know bees learn is foraging behavior.

What have been your experiences from your first paper/chapter/thesis drafts?", "preferred": "Don't worry its normal. Your professor is trying to help (even though it might not seem like it). Trust me, you should be more concerned if you didn't get any constructive feedback. Most academic articles and chapters need a few drafts before they are OK. Your professor knows that as soon as the chapter is published it will be seen globally so its important to make it as good as possible. Stay positive and keep going.

{"prompt": "CMV: piercing your baby's ears before they even learn to talk is a weird practice and it's iffy it's even legal I know this isn't a pressing issue or anything, but I can't help but low-key judge parents who insist on getting, what for all intents and purposes is a body mod, for their infant daughters. Daughters who sometimes are barely old enough to hold their own head up.  Piercings are painful. They might ache for a few days after the fact. Babies aren't particularly good at being clean, so there's a significant chance of infection, especially if the piercing site bothers the baby.  I'm not even mentioning the fact that these babies are nowhere near old enough to consent to a body mod. A small hole in their lobe is no big deal, yeah, but it's still their body. They should be able to make that decision for themselves. I think waiting even a couple of years is worth it.  Why I want my view changed: I just want to know what goes through a parents mind when they decide to risk their baby's health at such a young age all to conform to.. a weird gender norm? Because we don't put earrings on infant boys. In fact, some parents ban piercings for their sons even when they're older and request them.", "preferred": "\"Weird\" is relative. It's only weird in North America.  It's not a weird practice at all in South Asian countries and communities. In my culture, baby girls are adorned in all kinds of gold jewelry (necklaces, bangles, anklets, earrings) on their first birthday, so it's typical to get their ears pierced beforehand.  At the end of the day, piercing a baby's ears is purely for vanity purposes, but there is cultural significance to doing it in some areas of the world. In India alone, that's ~12.5% of the global population, so I guess it depends on how many people need to consider something \"not weird\" for you to consider it not weird.", "rejected": "Parents make decisions for their children.

{"prompt": "What type of silicone would be best for a masturbation cup? Porous vs Softness Hi, kinda of odd but I want to independently create a fleshlight type sex toy. I have a ton of questions, and those \u201cask an expert\u201d websites seem to be dead so here I am.   TLDR;;; looking to create or find a non porous, non toxic soft material for a fleshlight. I don\u2019t understand what makes up \u202asilicone and how to learn more.    OK so from the information I\u2019ve read, the less porous the material is the softer it is, but non porous means it can be cleaned properly/no bacteria growth.\u202c So obviously I\u2019m looking for a material that is low on the shore a hardness scale but is still non porous. Phthalate is apparently bad because that is the cause of chemical burns with sex toys, but this is what would make the silicone soft?   I don\u2019t know which compounds that make up silicone that influence porosity, softness, heat retention and elasticity, durability etc etc. How does the curing method effect the silicone? I don\u2019t understand what it is I need to create a silicone soft enough for a masturbator cup. Is \u201cmedical grade\u201d and \u201cfood grade\u201d silicones just that because the structure of them is less porous? Could the same type of silicone that breast implants use work - and how would I even know how to convey the exact type of silicone formula I want to a factory? I assume the harder silicon that holds the liquid of a breast implant could be used as a coat layer in a masturbation cup, over a softer silicone material that would be toxic with direct contact. What\u2019s the formula of breast implants silicone? How would I learn if it would would be durable enough to hold, and not deteriorate when constantly rubbed? How would a know how durable a type of rubber would be if thinly spread?  But then I see there\u2019s other options like TPE/TPR. It has a low durometer, and the lower the durometer the softer the material...how is this different from the shore scale? I read \u201cTPE is generally considered body safe\u201d - generally, so not always? How can I learn what kinds of silicone are \u201cmedical grade\u201d or are platinum cured and how do they differ? How would I be able to communicate this to a factory and check if it\u2019s \u201cgood quality\u201d?  I have a lot of questions and idk how to find answers to any of this, Google isn\u2019t exactly giving me answers that are referenced from real sources so I\u2019m just ?????

If I have to make any adjustments or variations later on, I write further down or on the back of the page or I add a new page into the page protector behind the original one.  I have also recently begun to use the Whisk app a bit. It's great for when you see a recipe online you want to remember to try later, but I still usually write every recipe down before actually using it. In addition to condensing information and creating a physical reference, it helps to ensure that I have a good understanding of the process before starting it, which I find cuts down on errors considerably."}

He is a \"meat and potatoes\" guy, and I am not. I know he is willing to try new thinks and basically has no choice but to eat what I make, but I am worried that I might scare him off. I love intense flavours, I use a lot of seasoning and I am not afraid of curries or spices.    My brother and father were similar to my boyfriend and after years of slowly trying different things, they eventually started liking a bit of variation.

Oh lastly try kimchi nachos with Korean BBQ on it, I haven't ran into one person that hated it thus far.", "rejected": "I'd start with Italian. Most meat and potato folks are very comfortable with Italian. Over the course of a few months, dial up the herbs and spices. Then start moving about the Mediterranean.

{"prompt": "My dog suddenly during a routine procedure. Today my dog died.  &#x200B;  She was a 13(or so) old Pekingese. I took her in for her second round of vaccinations and to discuss potential dental cleaning as her breath was horrid.  &#x200B;  Backstory:  &#x200B;  I adopted her nearly 5 years ago. A dental expert estimated her age at about 5-7. She had horrid teeth. He removed 18 during a 2 hr surgery in Spring 2014. Even though I tried to brush them as best I could (she hated it) little by little tartar returned. In Nov 2016 she needed an emergency surgery for a bladder obstruction. Her bloodwork showed less than ideal liver numbers but she survived and had her teeth done again.  &#x200B;  Then in Nov 2017 I noticed her sleeping alot more. I noticed her eye was a little red. I took her for a senior check up and the doctor found a glaucoma. I tried treating it but she lost the eye in January 2018. Lost the second in March 2018. In February I had a eye puncture done to try and save her second eye but it failed so it was removed.  &#x200B;  With each of these surgeries I thought my dog was gonna die. The eye removals and bladder stones were emergencies and yet she lived.  &#x200B;  After her eyes were gone shr was unbothered. Lived her dog life. Didnt like walkig outside that much so I pushed her in a dog stroller. She was still eating etc. She was never \"active\" or playful. Just my dog.  &#x200B;  Jump to the present:  &#x200B;  Over the last few weeks Ive had a random (unexplained) anxiety about my dog dying. Like when I got home the first thing Id do was check that she was alive(?). She was 85% the same dog. But I did notice a few things:  &#x200B;  1. She was breathing more often through her mouth while asleep. She never did this but she is a smush faced dog so....  &#x200B;  2. She was panting indoors randomly. I attributed it to overheating (due to her long coat during summer) but it ws rare so I thought nothing much of it.  &#x200B;  2. She had a period of incontinence. She was peeing in her sleep and while standing (without squatting) without realizing it. And this is a dog who HATES her own urine. The vet did a bladder check and it was clear. Then for the next 6 weeks the incontinence stopped and she started getting up to use her in house pee pads again.  &#x200B;  3. About 4 weeks ago she started eating less. Usually she eats twice a day. But she was always picky (and blind) so I figured she was just not aware of the time. I bought her some cheaper (more fragrant) dog food and mixed it with water. She ate more at first. But then started eating once a day. Then eating 90% of the food a coming back for the rest hours later. 3 weeks ago she hadnt eating for like 36 hrs so I was worried. So I gave her some plain yogurt with low fat and water mixed in. She ate it. This is when I thought her teeth might be the reason. But again she simple returned to eating semi regularly. Though her love of table food waned. (Attributed to a sore mouth).  &#x200B;  Jump to today:  &#x200B;  I took her to the vet this morning. Discussed her teeth with the vet. I wanted to know the state of her mouth. And asked if it would be better to remove her leftover 22 teeth rather than putting her under again next year when she was even older.  &#x200B;  He said he needed an xray and inspection of the mouth. To get that he would have to put her under for a short time and he would need bloodwork and a heart and lung xray.  &#x200B;  So I agreed.  &#x200B;  Bloodwork came out mostly normal. Her inflammation numbers were up. But slightly above average.(likely cause of her mouth). Her anemic levels were low (slightly below average). All her number were normal or in 1-3 points of normal.  &#x200B;  This vet went through the same process for each surgery and was confident it was fine to proceed and I agreed. I handed over my dog and waited outside.  &#x200B;  Time passed. Other people were waiting. Both vets were in the OR with my dog. I could hear a machine beeping. But I remained calm because Ive heard that sound in surgeries before. 35 mins passed. I was getting a little worried. But figured they were working on another dog and mine was up next or got delayed and procedure started much later after they took her back.  &#x200B;  Then they called me in the exam room. I swear I was about to get my dog handed to me. And they asked me to come to the back.  &#x200B;  She was lying there with tubes in her mouth. Dead.  &#x200B;  They explained this:  &#x200B;  They administered a low level of propofol and when the medicine was pushed her lungs simply stopped pumping. They said this can happen in certain situations for a few seconds with dogs but the lungs will restart pumping. Hers didnt. So they pushed medicine to reactivate the heart. But it didnt work. So they tried for like 25 minutes to revive her and failed. She passed away and they never even got to the xray and exam.  &#x200B;  What the fuck?!?  &#x200B;  I couldnt believe it. She was old. But she her major organs were all in good health. She wasnt allergic to it as all her last procedures used the exact same medicine and in higher doses for a longer time.  &#x200B;  But this time it killed her. And I cant figure out why. They explained that this happened very rarely. And online research says the same. They are a busy vet and said this happens to them once a year but rarely twice.  &#x200B;  But what I cant find is an explaination. Why would a low dose of propofol cause lungs to simply stop? The only explaination I find online are all \"veterinary negligence\" which is possible. But in the years I went there when I heard  OR machines going both vets were always back there, the same as this time. Assuming it wasnt negligence on their part,  what could have caused it? Shock? I literally can find anything on it. Like no one studies the \"unknown\" anesthetic deaths or something but that cant be true.  &#x200B;  The more I think about it the more I feel like my dog was showing yellow flags that she was in a cognitive decline. Maybe she wasnt going to die right away, but she was slowly on her way. And this procedure at this moment pushed her over the edge and she died. And whatever caused it wasnt picked up by bloodwork tests or x rays.  &#x200B;  The vets arent bad people. Its possible they fucked up. But they seemed to be in just as much shock as I was. Because theyve done this hundreds of times before and this is the first sudden death in a while. They even paid for her funeral and cremation.  &#x200B;  I always figured she would get some acute disease like kidney failure and I would have time to  process her impending death and hold her while I put her down. She died at around 11:45 this morning. Thry told me at 12:13pm. I brought her ashes home at 3:00pm. And now her urn is sitting on a shelf in front of me.  &#x200B;  I had a dog exactly 12 hours ago.

{"prompt": "Wife died in her sleep, looking for places to start looking for a cause My wife was 38, she had twins back in March and suffered severe complications due to preeclampsia. She had a flash pulmonary edema 4 days after her c-section. She had a mild left bundle branch block which reduced her ejection fraction to 53% before complications and down to 45% after. At her cardiologist appointment in May it was 47%.  She was taking 25mg Metoprolol succinate for that. She was also taking Zoloft for mild PPD. She took a thyroid pill but otherwise didn\u2019t have any other medical concerns. She was completely asymptomatic the night she died. She got into bed and asked me to turn the fan on because she was hot. I did this and woke up the next morning and she hadn\u2019t moved.   Doctors are telling me that they have no idea what could have caused her death. The autopsy came back inconclusive pending a toxicology screen and a biopsy. In my county that can take up to a year. In the meantime I am getting our 6mo old boys screened for heart conditions, sending her brother to get looked at, and trying to rule out as many things as I can.

{"prompt": "CMV: There should be maximum profit margins on goods OR we need to have zero regulations against getting out-of-state or out-of-country alternatives In particular, I'm referring to medicines and medical treatment. Instead of fully government-run healthcare, instead if the maximum profit were limited to prevent profit margins in the thousands for life-saving medication and so on, it would seem that the the medical industry could still operate as-is, but without being as rapacious and deadly.

In order to limit marginal profits, you\u2019d have to implement some sort of price cap.  This issue with price ceilings are pretty well known in microeconomics - and said issue makes it especially bad when we\u2019re talking about medical care. Basically, a price ceiling would result in a market disequilibrium in the form of a shortage. Supply would decrease along the supply curve, and demand would increase along the demand curve. Demand would be greater than supply, resulting in a shortage.  This shortage is especially bad when we consider medical treatment. Resting, diagnoses, medication, specific therapies - these things can be incredibly expensive. The people hit the worst in a shortage would probably be those who have more severe conditions that require the most care.  Instead, the idea of universal healthcare would account for hospital funding. Instead of private insurance companies paying for costly procedures, the government would.

Explain that with the sunglasses on it's really hard to see the actual mirror itself.  So radar and radio are just like light, but our eyes can't detect them.  We do have antennas that can detect them, but because we're using these to see over such long distances, it's like having sunglasses on, we need the radar \"flashlight\" to shine the object in order to see it (with radar).

But today, an A is the most common grade given in college; the percentage of A grades has tripled, to 45 percent nationwide. Seventy-five percent of all grades awarded now are either A\u2019s and B\u2019s. The National Association of Colleges and Employers reported in 2013 that \u201c66 percent of employers screen candidates by grade point average (GPA).\u201d  &#x200B;  \"The Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation also has studied college grading. The Foundation confirms the alarming findings recited above. It found that in 1969, only 7 percent of students at two- and four-year colleges reported that their grade point average was A-minus or higher. Yet in 2009, 41 percent of students reported as same. During the same period, the percentage of C grades given dropped from 25 to five percent.\"  &#x200B;  \"Under legislation proposed in the House of Representatives, the Texas \u201cContextualized Transcript\u201d bill calls for adding to transcripts the average grade given to the entire class for each of the courses on a student\u2019s transcript.

In upper division classes we weren't really under pressure to give out good grades, but there was a strong reticence to outright fail people.  As to what we did to combat it, in freshman labs (the only lower division classes I ever TA'd for), there was a multiple choice final exam that was tightly guarded (no one got to take an exam or any scrap paper home) and variations of the same questions would be asked every term, so the relative performance of each class was measured and considered when assigning final grades. I thought this was a really good system, because it both helped normalize grades between different TA's and helped avoid giving students taking labs off-sequence an advantage by only being compared with students who'd already failed the lab once or more.  There were other problems with rich kids' parents complaining to the lab coordinator rarely (Yay California!) but for the most part this didn't help people. Though I do know of at least one escaping expulsion for cheating on exams because their rich parents threatened to sue the school. Got a chemical engineering degree from a highly ranked school without being able to do simple stoichiometry problems. There are other stories, but none that scare me more than that one.

For more exploration of this, check out this thread.  * The ability to **cite sources** from specialist literature for any claims you make within your area.  * The ability to provide **high quality answers** in the subreddit in accordance with our rules.    For a more in-depth look at how applications are analyzed, consult this helpful guide on our wiki explaining what an answer that demonstrates the above looks like.  **How to apply**  To apply for a flair, simply post in this thread. Your post needs to include:  * Links to **3-5 comments** in /r/AskHistorians that show you meet the above requirements, and of which at least three were posted in the last six months. Answers linked in an application should go 'above and beyond' the base requirements of the rules here, and reflect the depth of your expertise.  * The **text of your flair** and which category it belongs in (see the sidebar). Be as specific as possible as we prefer flair to reflect the exact area of your expertise as near as possible, but be aware there is a limit of 64 characters.  One of the moderators will then either confirm your flair or, if the application doesn't adequately show you meet the requirements, explain what's missing. If you get rejected, don't despair! We're happy to give you advice and pointers on how to improve your portfolio for a future application. Plenty of panelists weren't approved the first time.  If there's a backlog this may take a few days but we will try to get around to everyone as quickly as possible.  **\"I'm an Expert About Something But Never Have a Chance to Write About It!\"**  Some topics only come up once in a blue moon, but that doesn't mean you can't still get flair in it! There are a number of avenues to follow, many of which are dealt with in greater detail at the last section of this thread.  **Expected Behavior**  We invest a large amount of trust in the flaired members of /r/askhistorians, as they represent the subreddit when answering questions, participating in AMAs, and even in their participation across reddit as a whole. As such, we do take into account an applicant's user history reddit-wide when reviewing an application, and will reject applicants whose post history demonstrate bigotry, racism, or sexism. Such behavior is not tolerated in /r/askhistorians, and we do not tolerate it from our panelists in any capacity. We additionally reserve the right to revoke flair based on evidence of such behavior after the application process has been completed. /r/AskHistorians is a safe space for everyone, and those attitudes have no place here.  **Quality Contributors**  If you see an unflaired user consistently giving excellent answers, they can be nominated for a \"Quality Contributor\" flair. Just message the mods their username and some example comments which you believe meet the above criteria.  **FAQ Finder**   To apply for FAQ finder, we require demonstration of a consistent history of community involvement and linking to previous responses and the FAQ. We expect to see potential FAQ Finders be discerning in what they link to, ensuring that it is to threads which represent the current standards of the subreddit, and they do so in a polite and courteous manner, both to the 'Asker', and also by including a username ping of the original 'Answerer'.  **Revoking Flair**  Having a flair brings with it a greater expectation to abide by the subreddit's rules and maintain the high standard of discussion we all like to see here. The mods will revoke the flair of anybody who continually breaks the rules, fails to meet the standard for answers in their area of expertise, or violates the above mentioned expectations. Happily, we almost never have to do this.  **Additional Resources**  Before applying for flair, we encourage you to check out these resources to help you with the application process:  * Our Rules Roundtable on what a 'Good Answer' looks like * Our Wiki Guide on what makes a good application * The Previous Application Threads, to see what makes for successful - and not successful - applications.  * The Sunday Digest, and Monthly Awards which can provide many examples of we are looking for regarding the caliber of flaired users.", "preferred": "Here\u2019s my flair suggestion: Holy Roman Empire, Brandenburg, Diplomatic History  Here are my comment proofs (sourced the main question):  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ke6w0g/according_to_wikipedia_apparently_the_title_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/klxdti/why_were_interregna_on_the_holy_roman_empire_so/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/kid3fa/does_anyone_still_identify_as_prussian_within_or/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/j2khgy/did_the_thirty_years_war_make_todays_eastern/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/j1j3e1/help_with_grad_school_advice/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/i7z7ns/if_the_peace_of_westphalia_established_a_new_way/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf", "rejected": "Greetings AH Moderators!  Following on a few months from my first attempt at a flair application, I believe I have taken the feedback provided then and have worked on addressing it consistently in my more recent responses on the sub.  I would therefore like to submit this application for a flair titled: \"Diplomatic History of the World Wars and Origins of World War I\", which would most likely fall under Military History as a heading.   Here are the 5 comments which I hope not only show improvement on the feedback from the previous application, but also merit the awarding of the flair:  * Why did the \"Special Relationship\" develop with Britain rather than France? * Why did Belgium 'only' get Eupen-Malmedy after the Versailles Treaty and not a (much) larger piece of the Rhine Province? * Did countries use WWI as an excuse to invade other countries and continue imperialism within their own continent? * Colonial war treaties in the 19th century (2-part response due to text limits on Reddit) * Was the treaty of Versailles after WWI overkill?  Many thanks Mods!"}
{"prompt": "How did the early indigenous people of the pacific islands obtain fresh drinking water? I dont know much about these islands and I don't know how people actually ended up on them, but they have been populated for a long time, so how did the people on them find fresh water to drink?", "preferred": "I have to bring into the discussion the Caribbean. Many of the Caribbean islands have no potable water and they are small enough that they have no ponds (other than salt ponds), rivers, etc.  Archaeological evidence and current study of people who still live there, suggest that the use of subterranean rivers (wherever possible) coupled with water catchment (rainfall) and other forms of water filtration were used. You can technically use water evaporation, filtration and condensation to make salt water potable.   The Caribbean islands did not have the benefit of coconut water (that is a recent import - 16th century).   On a side note: Dammit! I've avoided making an account and the day I make it is on Leap Day. Well... see you all on cake day four years from now.", "rejected": "In addition to rain fall, fresh water can be obtained from wells on the smaller islands. Wells are possible because fresh water is less dense than salt water and forms a lens in the soil by floating on the underlying salt water. As a result its fairly easy to find water on small islands as any water that collects in a well above sea level will be fresh.            edit: Deleted irrelevant info"}
{"prompt": "CMV: minimum wage should be 20 dollars an hour in America Hear me out before you get all crazy and talk about how it would put people out of work and drive inflation through the roof. Set the minimum wage to 20 and then to avoid crazy inflation, match the yearly minimum wage increase to inflation. If the minimum wage is matched with inflation increases then people wouldn\u2019t raise prices because it would just lead to a never ending cycle of price raise and wage increase. As far as it putting people out of work, that isn\u2019t going happen. Companies need workers no matter what. Nobody is going to lose their job with a 20 dollar wage because companies can\u2019t run themselves. They NEED those workers there.", "preferred": "Minimum wage is dumb. Sweden has no minimum wage and some of the highest paid workers ever. Just have mandatory unions deal with it, wage is specific to every type of job, industry, cost of living, and so many factors that a universal rule is ridiculous and doesn't really protect workers all that much", "rejected": "The only thing a minimum wage does it put everyone with an hourly market value below that (based on what they can produce in an hour) out of a job, which could very well ruin the economy due to the high increase of unemployment and the amount of small to medium businesses needing to close because they are no longer profitable. If you are a 16 year old with no experience or skills, chances are you are not going to make anyone 20 dollars an hour in terms of productivity. Why would anyone hire you for that amount if it's gonna just make them a net loss? This is the economic argument against higher minimum wage.  Your main argument however, is a moral one. You SHOULD earn a living wage, it is only \"fair\". However, companies are not forced to hire you, you aren't entitled a job. Here's a moral counter argument. If I want to work for 15 dollars an hour, and the employer I am talking to wants to hire me for that amount, then that makes both me and the employer very happy. Why would the government then proceed to tell us we cannot make that transaction? This is government overreach, they shouldn't interfere with voluntary transactions between people, if I want to sell you a guitar for cheap why would the government get in the middle and tell us we can't proceed because it's not a fair price? If I want to take a job for 15 because it's better than being unemployed, let me take the job ffs."}
{"prompt": "What books do you recommend on the history of science? (especially Physics) Hello, hello, hello!    I am an 18-year-old Physics student from Palestine, looking forward to learning more and more about science and its history; since we barely get taught anything about the history of science.    Keep in mind I am also interested in knowing the sources of the history in the books; I am just a curious dude.    Thank you!", "preferred": "I cannot recommend Richard Rhodes' \"The Making of the Atomic Bomb\" highly enough. Truly a literary masterwork on history of science.  Also highly recommend:  \"The Quantum Labyrinth\" by Paul Halpern which is about the friendship between Richard Feynman and John Archibald Wheeler and serves as a joint biography of them as well as the former's work on the Manhattan project, their early musings which led to Feynman's original approach to quantum mechanics and how that led to the beginnings of quantum field theory. This book is genuinely very well-written and even emotionally moving.  \"Faraday, Maxwell, and the Electromagnetic Field\" by Nancy Forbes is almost precisely the same kind of book as Quantum Labyrinth for 19th century physics. Joint biography of Faraday and Maxwell as well as the overall history of the study of electromagnetism.  \"The Man Who Stalked Einstein\" about Philip Lenard and the anti-Einstein Nazi scientist movement.   If you like straight-up biographies I can highly recommend  \"The Strangest Man\" by Graham Farmelo about Paul Dirac  \"Genius\" by James Gleick about Richard Feynman  \"Beyond Uncertainty\" by David Cassidy about Werner Heisenberg  \"Einstein\" by Walter Isaacson about -- well I can't actually remember who this one is about but I think he was some obscure physicist in the 20th century.  \"Wizard\" by Mark Seifer about Nikola Tesla  In terms of the \"proto-history\" of physics (up to and including Newton but not beyond)  \"The Clockwork Universe\" by Edward Dolnick  \"The Invention of Science\" by David Wootton  Not read yet but coming up on my reading list are:  \"Einstein's War\" by Matthew Stanley about Einstein's life and work during WW1  \"Dark Sun\" by Richard Rhodes about the post-war invention of the hydrogen fusion bomb.", "rejected": "For the history of physics starting around the end of the 1800s (since that's when the largest revolutions occurred), I found a very interesting three book collection simply called \"Twentieth century physics\" by Laurie M.

{"prompt": "Going to have to put my dog down soon (next 2-3 days) after discovering he has osteosarcoma. Pretty devastated. Any ideas for what I can do to make his last few days special for him? Breed: Vizsla  Age: 9 Years I live an hour and a half away from the beach in Oregon and I\u2019m thinking about taking him to the coast tomorrow since I have the day off and the weather is going to be great. I\u2019ll have to carry him since he has declined so fast within the last week and can barely walk but it won\u2019t be an issue for me. Got the results today that it\u2019s cancer. Incredibly unexpected. It\u2019s so bad in his leg that his skin is starting to split. Honestly the most loving dog I\u2019ve ever had (I\u2019ve had lots) and it pains me to see him in this shape. Named him after the TV show Dexter when we got him when I was 12. Saw him in the window of a shitty animal store (long closed down due to abuse) and we had to take him. From the start he was nothing but pure love and was definitely my dads dog. He slept with him just about every single night of his life. It was routine. Dexter loved to sleep under the blankets and would hit you if you dared to not give him love when he was in front of you. He would give you almost human like hugs and lay his head on my shoulder when watching tv. Nothing but 100% love in him. I\u2019m gonna miss him. My dad said it\u2019s up to me when to put him down and I want to do it by Sunday evening to put him out of pain.  My question for you guys is what I can do to make his last few days special?

Thank you.", "preferred": "I cooked a chicken breast for the last dog I had to say goodbye to, and minced it into small pieces and feed her from my hand.

I'm crying tears for you both.", "rejected": "Sorry you're going through this.  I think he'll just want to cuddle a lot with you, I think going to other places might be more special for you than him maybe? Does he have a place he particularly likes?

{"prompt": "[Star Wars] Why is everybody ok with droid slavery? Unfortunately this is a somewhat contentious topic, but lets try and keep things civil and within sub rules.  1) So, through Star Wars, most of the main characters are opposed to slavery of organics, and many galactic governments (try to) prohibit it. Some characters make efforts to free slaves when they find them.   2) Some robots are clearly sentient/salient/people, with intelligence, emotions and capabilities equal to those of organics. Despite this, droids are not seen as people and are freely traded and owned as property even under governments that ban slavery.  3) these two facts seem to be in conflict with eachother. Why do Jedi who are willing to risk their lives to save organic slaves not bat an eye about droid slavery?", "preferred": "\"Some robots are clearly sentient/salient/people, with intelligence, emotions and capabilities equal to those of organics.\"   Here's the thing with Star Wars, droids aren't sentient. Obi Wan states in episode 2 that \"If droids could think, they'd be none of us here.\" R2-D2 is the only droid that shows signs of sentience. I think it's in the same film, C-3PO states something along the lines of \"For a droid you seem to do an awful lot of thinking\" This is in reference to R2-D2 wanting to follow Anakin and Padme on Geonosis.   I think there was mention in the old canon of a droid uprising being an event in the past and IG-88 was most definitely sentient. mf hacked the Death Star II, again that's the old canon doubt that's canon now.", "rejected": "I don\u2019t think everyone is.  They tried to address that in Solo with L3-37 starting a droid rebellion, but no one else has taken it any further yet.  C-3PO and R2-D2 seem to have some autonomy, but they clearly prefer to have a \u201cmaster.\u201d  On the other hand, In Kieron Gillen\u2019s Darth Vader comic (and the subsequent Doctor Aphra series) there are a couple of evil droids that fight against their programmed obedience as much as they can, and Aphra is sympathetic to their desire for autonomy.  But that programming is the only thing that prevents them from killing her and going on homicidal rampages."}
{"prompt": "Does anyone else have a problem with the rubber stopper spouts for olive oil hardening, shrinking, and becoming a leaky mess over time?

Current medications: Ondanestron, Wixela, iron supplements, Vitamin B,C supplements. Also, just had blood work done and thyroid panel and CBC all came back normal. Yesterday was the worst day I\u2019ve ever experienced having a period. I soaked through 3 tampons in just under four hours. Decided to full stop the tampons and put a pad on, whilst doing that decided I need to use the restroom. To my surprise, instead of urine, blood poured out of me for a good ten seconds.

{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old what it means to \u201cprocess\u201c your emotions", "preferred": "A lot of people are saying that processing your feelings is about figuring out where they come from. I think that can be part of it, but it's very easy to get caught up in analyzing our feelings and trying to understand them as a way to avoid actually feeling them. When we do this, we may think about what bothers us all the time, but never actually feel relief or like we're making progress. So rather than focusing so much on figuring things out, I think of processing more like riding the wave of the emotion. I do that by naming it and noticing the sensations that come along with it (for ex: I feel tense and there's a ball of energy in my chest. I think I'm anxious). Then I check in with my body to see if there's anything I need (food, water, sleep, social connection, movement). After that, I may talk to someone about the feeling or write it down, or I may just move back to engaging with the world around me, acknowledging that this feeling is here right now and it may affect what I perceive and what I need until it passes.", "rejected": "Purely mechanically...  Think about it like habit building. You are pretty much building bridges here.  If you... process emotions by confronting them, by letting your mind go into freeroam, by adressing the things bothering you.....by getting healthy substitute behaviours to get you off thought spirals and such, this is also why journaling is cool.  Putting stuff on paper confronts and helps processing.  That act in itself fires that circuit for that emotion / trauma... paired with other stimuli.  So if you think about stuff mindfully..why do i think this way.. why am i sad? That too builds those connections.  Since stuff that fires together wires together.. soon enough something which was painful is more manageable.... this is when we processed our emotions.  We built that neuronal bridge.   Sleep is important for this. Also a calm state so pacing, walking, meditation helps immensely...these days we tend to not allow ourselves to get into a state to properly process our emotions it is part of why depression and stress is so high...our brain just goes into thought spirals that are not adressed.  This is also why it is suprisingly helpful to go to a funeral.. you'd think theres just a handful of sad people in the room... but exactly because theres a bunch of people grieving and experiencing loss. That exposure and just bouncing off together helps processing the loss... since we are social beings, just being exposed to others experiences tends to help us out too...even many animals grieve communally...our brain remembers stuff we tie emotions to more.. when you said your goodbyes around all those grieving people.  Your brain sticks that to memory and it will keep sitting there and eventually helps you detatch the sad emotion from your loss.  Due to this thing where our brain builds connections that are common and cuts / makes other things not used weaker...the  brain also has the capability to kinda detach emotions from certain traumatic events.. that traumatic accident or messed up stuff. Will not fade from memory, but given the right processing and method to detatch emotions from the trauma...one can learn to live with it and not absolutely break."}

I feel that the preference in our tax system for capital gains instead of ordinary income is an unfair susbidy towards the rich, who earn the majority of the capital gains.  I would be ok with only taxing real capital gains (meaning over and above inflation, so if you buy a stock at $100 and sell one year later at $103 and inflation was 3%, you would not have any gain to pay taxes on).  I've seen arguments that treating capital gains differently from earned income encourages investment, but I don't see the need to subsidize investing in the stock market over working or any other thing people choose to do with their money.

What I want to change your view on is that it \u201cunfair\u201d. So a few points here to maybe consider:   1) A lot of this has to do with the fact that most middle class people will try to \u201cflip\u201d their investments too quickly, and end up getting taxed for a short term investment (with is taxed at the ordinary income tax rate). While larger companies or \u201cricher\u201d people have longer term investments that actually take advantage of the capital gains tax. It\u2019s not unfair, it\u2019s just that normal people either get bad advice or are ignorant to the tax code.   2) We already have a progressive tax rate for the capital gains rate based on your income. So richer people actually pay a higher capital gains tax anyway compared to their more modest counterparts.   *\u201dI would be ok with only taxing real capital gains (meaning over and above inflation, so if you buy a stock at $100 and sell one year later at $103 and inflation was 3%, you would not have any gain to pay taxes on). \u201c*  If you did this, you would effectively be taking away a lot of incentive to invest. This actually helps businesses because sometimes their projected return on investment isn\u2019t high enough to get investors to buy in. So the tax incentive sweetens the deal for investors, which ends up being good for everyone.   *\u201dI've seen arguments that treating capital gains differently from earned income encourages investment, but I don't see the need to subsidize investing in the stock market over working or any other thing people choose to do with their money.\u201d*   I really hope you can consider this a bit more. while these people do benefit from the capital gains tax at a higher overall amount, the benefit that comes from promoting investing actually helps out us normal folk a lot more than if we just taxed their income that they hide in some foreign country anyway. When they invest it does create jobs, there\u2019s a direct correlation between the two.   *\u201dFurthermore, treating capital gains differently from income encourages the rich to try to classify their income as capital gains (see carried interest for hedge fund managers).\u201d*  Well yes they do take advantage of the tax break but that\u2019s the incentive to get them to invest instead of just jumping into a sea of gold coins like Scuge McDuck and saying fuck the rest of us lol. It helps things run a bit more smoothly when the rich will just invest instead of trying to collect their taxes and disperse the love. If we can give them incentive to do it then it\u2019s a good idea, it won\u2019t stop them from being rich if we get rid of the incentive to invest.

But if you say that I can make more money and not have to pay as much tax by investing in the stock market, I'm more likely to give it to a stranger like Elon Musk to try to make cool things for the world.  The other part of it is that capital gains requires long term investments. Short term investments (currently those held for less than a year) are taxed like regular income.

Use a baking sheet or whatever. Then, put your aluminum skillet (not nonstick!) on your hottest burner and heat it up until it passes the water bead test.  Keeping the heat on high, drop in the steak (shake off any juices first). Cook 30 seconds to a minute on each side until well seared. Move back onto baking sheet. No need to rest since it was baked slowly.  This will still make a bunch of smoke getting that nice crust, but much less since it's exposed to high heat for a much shorter time.

FURTHERMORE: your aluminum pan is more likely to warp while heating for the big sear than cast iron, you may lose this favorite pan.

Of course, not limited to these tasks.  The job duties outlined by the employer are expected to be completed, regardless of whether or not the employee receives a tip from the customer or not.  This also leads to my opinion on tipping and that it should never be expected, but they should still be allowed to be accepted if offered.  It seems like the \"tipped employee\" wage difference is somewhat exploitative in favor of the employer, even though the employer would be required to compensate the difference if the employee did not earn at least the minimum wage in tips.  In some cases, customers return to a specific restaurant with service received having an influence on that decision.

{"prompt": "CMV: Dating and finding a relationship is easier for the average woman compared to the average man Now, this isn't a post to bash women or how dating is easy for women. It's about how when you compare the experience of the average woman compared to the average man, it's easier for the woman to find dates and a relationship.  Let's start with an example from my personal life. Last year some friend of mine broke up. So far the woman has gone on multiple dates with three different dudes one after the other. Essentially when she decides that she doesn't like one guy she just moves on to the next one in less than a week. While my male friend hasn't had a single date so far and that's not due to a lack of trying. Now even though at the end of the day they are both still single, the women at least go on dates which mean she has a higher chance to find someone compared to the man who hasn't been on a single date.  This brings me to my first point. The average woman has a lot more options compared to the average man. I remember reading a survey that said that on average women are asked about 12 times a year compared to asking less than 1 guy out. And when we introduce online dating it gets even worse. On average a woman has a match rate of 30% while a man has 0.013%. This means that statistically, women have a lot more opportunities to meet the one compared to a man. More options are better than fewer options.  My second point comes down to the average dating strategy. The average woman is a lot more passive than a man, in the man is still the one doing the asking out and trying to impress the woman. This means that women have the option to just passively exist and they just pick and choose from their options. In addition to that, they always have the option of becoming proactive and going after the guys they want if they don't like their options. Compared that to the average guy whose only option is to actively go out looking for women and initiating stuff, since if he just stayed and waited for women to approach he will remain single.

{"prompt": "If most philosophers today are analytic, why are almost all well-known 20th Century philosophers continental? I read here some time that most working philosophers today are analytic.  As your average armchair philosopher, I'm trying to square this with the fact that most stuff I find to read doesn't seem to be analytic.  Even the most recent big names in North America like Richard Rorty and Charles Taylor are apparently Heideggerian.  What is the reason behind this, and what should I read to make sure I'm understanding analytic philosophy?", "preferred": "While the analytic tradition is dominant within philosophy departments, the proliferation of continental theory in the social sciences, and the humanities more broadly, has led to a wider reach among laypeople. In a purely mathematical sense, the collective number of english, sociology, anthropology, and poli sci students will outweigh the number of philosophy majors. Consequently, it's much more likely that your average undergraduate will be exposed to Foucault or Bourdieu rather than Kripke or Parfit. This is, of course, a broad generalization and authors like Rawls and Kuhn are some of the most highly cited writers in the humanities and social sciences. But it seems, broadly, that one is more likely to be exposed to continental thought in higher education, resulting in a lot of quasi-academic material targeted towards laypeople (books, podcasts, video essays). For example, Zizek has two documentaries explaining many concepts in psychoanalysis and marxism through sardonic, ironic, and self-aware parody of popular culture. Bryan Magee's televised interviews from the 1970s focuses primarily on the analytic tradition or on the opinion of analytic philosophers; however, their conversations are much more rigid and typically academic. Surely still approachable to a lay audience, but less immediately attention grabbing than Zizek parodying Full Metal Jacket to explain Lacan and Althusser.   Also, to reiterate an already made point, analytics mostly publish journal articles. Unless one has institutional access or is aware of alternative methods of bypassing paywalls, it's much more likely that they will walk into a bookstore and see Foucault,  Heidegger, or Sartre on the shelf.", "rejected": "There were plenty of analytic 20th century big name philosophers: Wittgenstein (potentially), Quine, Wilfrid Sellers, Carnap, Popper, Kuhn, Russell, GE Moore, Putnam, David Lewis, Saul Kripke etc.   > what should I read to make sure I'm understanding analytic philosophy?

You can always check the bibliography and the SEP for most influential works that are relevant to your interest and done by the philosopher of your interest. For example, for politics, ethics etc. you may have Rawls, Parfit, for phil. of mind, Chalmers, Dennett, Nagel for Phil. of science Cartwright, Van Fraassen etc. (and that's all just a few names off the top of my head; there are many more)"}
{"prompt": "I'm a recent graduate, got in trouble at my internship, could use advice So I'm working as a design engineer at a small company (5 people total work there).  There's this part my boss made that has already started to be manufactured, but a company we're working with on the project wanted to revise it slightly. My boss decided that, even though I'm not on this project and didn't make this part (he did), I should be the one to make the revisions. He forwarded the email to me, which listed 2 revisions that needed to be done: increase a certain diameter and remove a certain hole.  They included a step file of the revised part, and my boss superimposed the revised part on our old part so I could see where changes needed to be made.  I made the proper changes exactly as the email stated. When I looked at the two parts superimposed, I noticed there was still a difference in the parts: this hollow cylinder extruding from the part was conical, and part of it was cut out on theirs and our part was straight with no cuts. When showing my boss the revisions I made exactly as I was instructed, I pointed out this difference and asked if our part needed to have the same cylindrical shape. He said yes, it needed to look like that, and asked me to make that revision as well. I revised the cylinder feature so it looked exactly like the step file that was sent to us. When my boss looked it over again, he got really upset that I changed the inside of the cylinder as well. Apparently, that company that sent us the revision didn't update the inside of their cylinder when they sent us the step file. Like I said, I didn't make this part so I had no way of knowing that the inside of that cylinder hasn't been revised,  It just made sense to me that if the outside was different and I needed to change it, the inside should be changed as well. I've never seen my boss more upset with me, he gave me a hard time for the rest of the day, and at one point I was fighting back tears. I don't know what I could have done differently.

It was completely adequate and did its job not to mention the programming used to run them expected them to go slowly. Well one of these smart hillbillies didn't like how our vents opened and close, and designed a giant hydraulic cylinder that went from open to close in 1 sec, and could probably actuate 1000 vents (he was only running 10) they machined everything themselves and it was beautifully painted and it was a marvel to look at. Problem was it was messing with our programming, as it needed a certain Feedback over 5 seconds to verify the vents were open.  I remoted in and ran their equipment for a minute to see what was going on, and the vents read 0% to 100% with nothing in between, I said there is something wrong with your actuator, or feedback from your actuator.

{"prompt": "Can you help diagnose me (M25)? 4 Doctors haven't been able to and I'm getting desperate. I'm a 25 year old male (150 lbs, 6') that has had some serious pain in my feet for the last 8 months that's slowly spreading throughout my other joints. I'll do my best to outline the events and time line below:  **May 2022** \\- I woke up one morning and my second toe (next to the big toe) on my right foot was noticeably swollen with mild pain. I hadn't had any injuries or activities that would have caused this but I didn't think much of it.   **June 2022** \\- After a month of swelling, the pain slowly got worse, to the point that it was painful to walk. I went to a pediatrist and he thought it was a torn ligament in that toe. He put me on steroids for a week and saw me again. No improvement was made so he put me on another dose of the same steroid. Just like the first, nothing happened. After the meds, he decided to put me into a boot for a month.   **August 2022** \\- After a month of wearing the boot, I didn't see any improvement and noticed that the swelling was starting to spread to other toes on my right foot. This started to get me worried so I went to another pediatrist who said that it was definitely not a torn ligament. His guess was that it was gout. He did a uric acid blood test, which came back negative but still decided to put me on alopurinol for a few weeks to see if it did anything. After I finished the meds, no improvement had been made and the pain and swelling was getting worse.   **September 2022** \\- By this point I was getting desperate and started to look other places to see if it was caused by something else. I went to an internal medicine doctor that did a full blood panel to see if any of my levels were off. The panel came back completely nonreal, even noting that once again the uric acid levels were normal. He didn't have any suggestions as to what could be causing the foot pain and swelling. By this point, the swelling had spread to all the toes on the right foot and the pain was very prominent around the joint of the big toe and the bottom side of all the toes in the metatarsal area.   **October 2022** \\- By this point, I was starting to have swelling on my big toe on the left foot and was getting sharp pain in my right hip area, deep within the glute, that was making it really difficult to move around. I went to go see an orthopedic surgeon to see if he had any ideas as to what this would be. He said that he had never seen anything like this, and even brought his colleague in to see if they had any ideas. They were both stumped and told me to try stem cell treatment that wasn't covered by insurance. I didn't want to jump into that without getting an actual diagnosis so I wasn't throwing away money.   **December 2022** \\- By this point I'm completly at my wits end trying to figure out what this is and not having any doctors know what it is. The swelling has gotten really bad in the right foot, causing dark colors around all the joints of the toes, especially in the mornings. My right knee has also started to get swollen and has similar pain to the toes, especially when the knee is straightened.  My next step is to see a rheumatologist but they are booked out until February. I'm hoping that one of you have an idea that could help me out.

{"prompt": "CMV: Liberals should abandon identity politics and instead focus on class/economic issues Identity Politics (IP) is largely unhelpful and extremely divisive. The focus on identity by liberals alienates other people on the left and creates huge distance from those in the middle and those on the right. Class/economic issues, such as wealth inequality and ending crony capitalism, are far more unifying messages for those who hold liberal ideology. Alleviating class/economic issues would also have downstream positive impact on many other issues (often championed by IP) such as racial inequality.  Proponents of IP get caught up too often in the characteristics of the individuals making political arguments \u2013 practically by design. The speaker therefore is weighted according to inherent traits they happened to be born with (race, gender, sexual orientation). This creates an environment in which large portions of the population/electorate (i.e. straight, white, male) feel that their opinions and issues are valued less than others. The resulting atmosphere, exacerbated deliberately by right leaning talking points, causes many to abandon the left.  Class/economic issues should become the leading message for liberals, given the broader appeal it would naturally have. Discussing and championing issues of income distribution/poverty/corruption would reach a much larger population and could pull many in the middle and on the right back toward the left. This would not only be practically useful for political reasons, but would also have a net positive impact on many of the class-related social issues that we see in society.     _____  > *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

There are certain events that involve speedsters that have to happen, or a major paradox would occur. These fixed points in time are somehow preserved by the speed force unless something happens that renders these events irrelevant, and the speedster involved is maintained as a time remnant. For example, when Eddie Thawne was killed, the mainline Eobard was killed, but the speed force saved a time remnant of Eobard, possibly from another timeline, in order to kill Barry's mom, since that event is a fixed point in time. It's not clear how these remnants are actually generated, possibly they just pop into existence in the speed force from another timeline.   As for what this means for Eobard's ability to be hurt, if Eobard A is fighting you, and Eobard B is a \"future\" version that does something important to the timeline, then you can still harm Eobard A, even kill him, but then a remnant of Eobard B will exist for the purposes of preventing any further paradoxes.   Which leads to a final point, does this mean that a version of Eobard Thawne must always exist? I'm fairly sure that point has been brought up before by Thawn as a yes.

{"prompt": "Recently found out I am not the biological father of my 2 year old son. She is aware of this and threatens for me never see him again over any minor parenting disputes. Is there anything I can do? Also, first ever reddit post, very new to this. I live in the UK. Me and his mother haven\u2019t been together since before he was born as we broke up when she was pregnant. We agreed we didn\u2019t want to be with each other but wanted to do right by our son. However long story short, I did a peace of mind DNA test (private - not legally binding) found out he wasn\u2019t mine. However I want to just carry on raising him as i love him as if he were my own son and have been having every weekend since he was born and some days in the week. We have a very loving rather & son relationship and he calls me Daddy. However she is aware that I am not the biological father and the real father is not interested and is staying away. Here is the kicker, she seems to have it in her head that now I have a gf who also has a child, she kicks off all the time even though absolutely nothing with my son has changed, not the relationship with him, time spent with him, nothing. I have no idea why on earth she is so bitter towards me other than catching her out I guess. She has already said that my gf can never meet him as she doesn\u2019t like her (literally never met or spoken to her) if she does she will take me to court have my name taken off the certificate and bye bye.

{"prompt": "CMV: We (as in Western society) have seemingly stopped trying to build better lives for our children For 100s of years it seemed appropriate to view Western society as building a better life for our children:  * houses were built to last (the house I live in is from the 17th century), so were a permanent improvement to the village/town * education systems were built and expanded in years taught * roads * electrification/other utilities (e.g. water, sewage, gas, etc.) * healthcare systems * police/armed forces to keep people safe * fire brigades   However, it seems since the post-war period we have built very little to benefit our children. The only thing I can think of is the internet (and associate infrastructure), but as this isn't even permanent - websites seem more like temporary structures that are designed to be demolished and replaced than permanent improvements.  Houses built in the post-war (to modern day) period seem designed in the same way: temporary structures of wood rather than stone.  So my question is: what should we (or are we, and I simply don't know about it) be building to enrich our children's and further descendants lives better?", "preferred": "Wood buildings last for as long as they are maintained and are more earthquake resistant. Really why wood is used is due to globalization, as Italy (random example) basically does not have forests any more but Canada does, and wood is just so dramatically cheaper than stone which was relevant in the post-war baby boom. It is also easier to modify, so in the long run it makes perfect sense to build high quality wood framed homes when you can (no more than three stories).", "rejected": "couple things off the top of the head  Most infrastructure is being modified to avoid pollution. eg; new more efficient houses, modular and factory built to minimise waste. Renewable energy solutions, more efficient transport.  Better food security and access continues to ensure choice. ie; so future generations dont starve.  Space exploration - a long shot, but its not just for fun.  We dont necessarily need new roads, dams etc; but to make better use of existing things. If you consider all the material things done in past generations might actually mean futurue generations dont get to experience them due to extinction/habitat loss then a re think for simply building more and better material things is probably needed."}

The company is only getting charter flights for majority nationalities (Philippines and Indonesia) but my nationality has less than 40 people on board and the company shows no interest in booking a charter for that amount. While they are contractually obliged to get us home, they appear to focus on doing so at their own pace and spending as little money as possible (they have terminated our contracts to save money).

Once in American waters, American Admiralty law take effect. If they get a local lawyer to file a suit for non-paid wages then that opens a case with the US Marshalls. They can do this by getting ahold of the nearest Seamans Church. The Marshalls can then come detain the ship. I believe this is allowed because it violates maritime law regarding indentured servitude/Slavery. I don\u2019t believe our 13th amendment applies but there is clearly stated international maritime law prohibiting indentured servitude. The only way they couldn\u2019t be allowed off the boat is if the OP is one of the licensed crew for the Engine room or Deck officer. If they are then you won\u2019t be allowed off since the USCG Capt of the Port has to make sure all vessels in their jurisdiction are fully crewed within the minimum manning requirements posted on their Cert. of Inspection.  Edit 1: others have commented about travel and repatriation. I\u2019m familiar with US flag laws more than foreign but most Flags state that travel and repatriation is the responsibility of the charter/ company, wether the contract was completed or terminated early. If your fired it\u2019s a bit different.  Edit 2: this article explains similar situation I was try to assist with back in January.    https://gcaptain.com/bouchard-ordeal-evokes-19th-century-supreme-court-decision/  Note that this applies only to US flag vessels but the procedures to get the crew paid or off the boat should still apply.  Edit 3: depending on what country you ship is registered in it might be a signatory of the International Labor Org. Maritime Labor Convention of 2006. Research MLC 2006 to learn more about the protections afforded to crew members from this piece of legislation. This was pretty recent for international law so not all countries who are signatories have ratified or implemented it yet. But it\u2019s worth looking into since there are protections for crew from shoreside Managment if they threaten your pay or benefits.  Edit: 4: Sorry this is my first comment so I was very quick to comment in an attempt to help. I did not read the rules first.

Google some answers that are less clich\u00e9 and could apply to your work area (technical weakness that can be fixed, minor time management weakness, etc.) What is important is to give an example that shows how the steps you have taken to resolve the issue have improved your weakness and to mention a time frame and what new steps you are taking currently to further improve the situation.

She's a Project Manager. From the beginning the team and I have been confused on what her role exactly is. When I would send her some emails, she would reply to me with an attitude. I let it go in the beginning but later when working together she started being more and more rude. Whenever I ask her questions she usually goes to our manager to tattle (same manager) and my manager does one of the following: sends out an email to everyone, call me directly with Amy's question, or tell me in the meeting with the team about my concern.  The issues have gotten worse lately. It has made a very toxic environment for me. I'm sure my boss knows of the issues. I got a very nasty email from Amy today, my boss was added in the email and said nothing of it. I see that my boss is on her side. Boss has been working around 6 years too.   I reached out to HR to ask if she is available to meet. I would like to show her the email evidence of how Amy has been replying to me.

I don't want HR to talk to my manager or Amy about this, but I guess I wanted to let her know of this issue and to let me know if I might be wrong here.

Your body's response to many stresses is to go into a recuperation mode. When you use up resources you get sleepy. You could also get sleepy from being sick. And you get sleepy from physical exercise which is just using up a different set of resources.  So it's not like your brain builds up lactic acid the way your muscles do, but there's probably a very similar mechanism in terms of dealing with all the chemical exchanges that go along with thinking.  So I can't give you the biochemical mechanism directly, but if you look up the term \"exhaustion of executive function in the human brain\" and whatever related terms you can think of, you might find some very interesting reading.  note that this can happen in a very limited way if you just do something like repeat the same word over and over again until it loses meaning. You can literally exhaust that one pathway specifically.  The sensation of sleepiness is just your brain's way of saying that it's had enough of what's been going on and it needs a break.

I usually never question films or shows and pick on little details but this bugged me when I was rewatching Endgame for the hundredth time the other day.

Apparently, the Wasp is also on the com as she says \u201cwe are on it Cap\u201d. It would make sense for the Avengers that were in the compound before the attack to have had coms in their ears but for the people that weren\u2019t it\u2019s questionable.

One of the things that you'll see is that part of communicating with another device can involve a negotiation phase where the two devices communicate on the lowest common denominator to try and figure out what capabilities both devices have.  Once that's handled everything else can shift up to something more appropriate.  Stark has been messing around with AI and other advanced programming ideas for a while now.  If you jammed an AI into the negotiation phase of your communication protocol, then you could get away with all sorts of crazy ideas.  Like, each radio can start off shouting prime numbers into the void and then end up co-inventing a custom protocol just so that the people talking to each other can exchange a few words about lunch.  Stark has also had a long time to think about this.  He first gets introduced to aliens in Avengers 1, which means he would be thinking about how would you open comms with an alien species that you have never met.  Additionally, alien species would have already been thinking about this problem for centuries.  Everyone in the universe keeps on bumping into new and interesting people they've never met before.  At some point every civilization ends up coming to the same conclusion.    Step 1:  Create near human, human, or super human AI.  Step 2:  Jam that AI into your radio.  Step 3 (the AI takes over from now on):  The meat sacks want to flap their meat at each other over radio (losers).  Okay, well, let's try showering out prime numbers, fibonacci sequence, or something that can be analyzed with information theory to be shown to be interesting.  Something to get the attention of the unknown AI on the other end.  Step 4:  Hey, some poor AI is vomiting out digits of PI into the void.  Let's also vomit some PI out into the void and then switch it up with digits of e.  That should get its attention.  Step 5:  Start sending over a computational framework.  Lambda calculus, SK combinators, turing machines.  Really whatever floats your boat.  Keep an eye out for the other AI doing the same thing.  At first just show an example program with an input and the expected output.  But by the end we'll be sending over complex programs with complex inputs and expecting the other AI to send back the correct answer.    Step 6:  Okay, we can send each other programs now and have a reasonable expectation that the other side can execute it.  So, send over the program for decoding the beautiful digital data into the disgusting meat sack skin flap noise using a speaker.    Step 7:  Initiate some sort of game with the other AI.  The lower level circuits can handle all the comms from now on.  Might as well try to kill the milliseconds by doing something interesting.", "rejected": "Sure, let's go with that."}

{"prompt": "Involved in a multi car accident with fatalities. I want to help all I can but I also want to protect myself. California  Just a warning this is extremely graphic.  Over the weekend, my boyfriend, our friend, and I went on a trip to the coast. We were driving back to Sacramento early in the morning when there was an accident. We were driving through a rural area on a highway, going 65, and it was pitch black. From what I could tell in the dark and at my distance, and with the speed in which things were happening, it looked like two cars collided and debris was all over the road. I braked hard and went to avoid the cars but hit some debris so I pulled over.   When I got out to check my vehicle, I ran back to the scene to see what I hit and discovered a body in the far right lane. I went on auto pilot and called 911. I did my best to explain where we were and what happened. There was another body on the ground a couple lanes away from the first, and a girl screaming and pinned under a car. I stayed with her while bystanders and my passengers did their best to make the scene safer by redirecting traffic.  When police arrived we got together with them and lifted the car off the girl. She had a severe head injury. I stayed with her until the paramedics arrived which was also about when she stopped breathing. I have no idea if she made it, or what her quality of life will be if she did.  After the paramedics took over I broke down and walked back to my car. I cried heavily for a couple of minutes. An officer approached me and my passengers and took our statements. I told them I think I hit someone and they tried to convince me I only hit debris. I was not convinced, and leaned under my car with my phone flash light on and found blood and bits of...flesh or brain, smeared all over my car's belly and hanging down from the heat shields and exhaust system. I was angry with the officer for blowing me off and trying to get us to leave. I had a literal crime scene under my f\\*cking car.  Eventually they decided there were three separate incidents. An officer gave me a card with his badge number and the incident number. He took my insurance information and took pictures of my vehicle, but only took one picture of my vehicle's underside from the front. Remember this was pitch black rural territory with no streetlights. Then he told us that they had everything they needed, that we could go, and to just take my car to a car wash and rinse it off really good, which is absolutely mortifying imo but what else are you supposed to do??  I'm asking if there is anything else I can do. It the daylight you can see better just how much human remains are smeared and hanging off my undercarriage. I doubt the evidence that was collected and I had the thought to have a local CHP officer come out and take additional photos and send them to the officers who responded (we drove straight home from there after that, skipping Sacramento altogether. I don't feel comfortable stating where I live here but I do live in California). I haven't washed my car yet and I would like to do so as soon as possible...I need to get rid of that smell, and I need to have my transmission looked at because it doesn't sound good after what happened.  I just don't know if this could be used against me. I feel like not because of the way the officers were treating the situation, trying to convince me I didn't hit a literal human and trying to get me to leave. Barely taking pictures and all. But I don't know. I just don't know. I'm sorry if I'm asking stupid questions I just want to do everything I possibly and reasonably can. I didn't see what I hit, and if I did, avoiding it could have put myself and my passengers at further risk. The incident was spread across the highway taking up all three lanes and even the shoulders on either side. I just didn't want to collide with the vehicles in the wreckage.  I also want to find out, if legally possible, if there were survivors. One paramedic said the two bodies were gone, but was vague about the girl. I've spoken with my friends, some of whom are medical professionals, about the injury she sustained and the potential for her survival, and no one seems to think that with a head injury like that than anyone could live and if they could, their quality of life wouldn't be great. An article I found online describing the incident states there was one fatality and two taken to the hospital with major injuries, which obviously conflicts with what the paramedic told me. I also want to know if my impact with that passenger killed him, because the article (if it's accurate, who knows) states that the only person who died was the one my vehicle collided with and if the other two people initially survived their ejection, I have reason to believe the man I hit was also alive.  So would it be in my best interest to just rinse off my car and move on with my life, and not try to get more information to the officers? Do they need more information? I feel awful and selfish for asking such a question, but my heart goes out to those people and I want to do everything I can. But I also don't want to have the family members come after me. There's nothing I could have done differently that would have been safer or better. And no amount of evidence or whatever is going to bring that man back to life. Either way, whether he was dead or alive before I hit him, nothing is going to bring him back to life. And I have to live with that.  Also, how can I legally and respectfully find out if the other two people survived? Would it be a bad idea to tell the officers to give my phone number to the family members? I don't know what I would tell them...I don't know. I just don't know how to proceed and I don't want to do something to make things worse.

I suggest contacting your liability insurance prior to doing anything with your car, including washing it, and see if they want photographs with the remains intact. I would not contact the police with regards to this matter as, frankly, it isn't going to help you at all and it isn't going to either help or hurt the investigation into the at-fault driver.   Because this matter involves at least one fatality, there is a strong possibility that you will be pulled into litigation of this matter, primarily because there is likely limited insurance coverage to compensate for the damages to all three injured parties by the at-fault driver's insurance. Your insurance company should provide you an attorney to represent you with regards to that matter. If you are contacted by any other insurance company, decline to make a recorded statement. You will likely be required to make one for your own insurance. If you are contacted by the police, I would recommend consulting with a criminal attorney before speaking to them further.   As far as finding out what happened to the victims, that may be a can of worms you don't want to open. If this occurred in a rural area, the local newspaper will likely have a follow-up story regarding whether there were any additional fatalities (rural areas tend to have a slow news cycle). However, I would really consider whether or not you want to know the disposition of these people prior to searching. I would also suggest you speak with a mental health provider or counselor about this. You were involved in a very traumatic incident and I can only imagine saw some pretty terrible things.

Current ecosystems are struggling, and that will get worse in the coming decades. There isn't a wealth for the dinos to jump into.   The mosasaur is going into an overfished ocean with depleted whale populations. (I think the park made the mosasaur bigger than it has historically been, maybe same company policy as the Indominus)   Cetaceans didn't exist back then. Maybe the whales will keep far away from the larger predators.

{"prompt": "[19F]Experiencing bad pulsating headaches nonstop for the past week and noticed big hard lump growing on side of my neck. It is currently 10:38pm as I\u2019m writing this and I haven\u2019t left my bed since 2:30am this morning and that was to let my mum know about the lump.  Today I\u2019ve had no appetite and last time I ate was around 7:30pm yesterday. 20mins ago I got up to use the toilet and as I was making my way out, I collapsed. My body gave out on me so I just laid there for about 10mins until my body gained back conscious. Mind you, my room is directly in front of the bathroom yet I couldn\u2019t even make it past the bathroom door.   I\u2019m not sure if there is a connection but for the past 2/3 weeks my right ear has been really sore but since I always had problems with my ears I ignored it and thought the pain will die down on its own in a week or so but since then I\u2019ve slowly started experiencing migraines straight from hell 24/7. I kid you not, it feels like Mike Tyson is in my head goin HAM. It\u2019s gotten to the point I\u2019m now constantly sleep deprived, lightheaded & nauseous but still I didn\u2019t feel like it was concerning enough to go see the doctor coz I know how busy it is rn and to go in for migraines I didn\u2019t think was fair so thought, \u201cit\u2019s because I\u2019m in bed all day, food will fix it\u201d.   Started having neck pain 6 days ago, did a quick google search and concluded it was poor sleeping posture. Now couple days later and my lips are dry no matter how much water I drink or lip balm I put, they\u2019re constantly dry as well as my throat. Later that night is when I feel a small lump on the right side of my neck in the middle. I thought I was tripping, I could feel something there but convinced myself I\u2019m imagining since it wasn\u2019t visible and brushed it off. Until this morning at 2am, I was trying to massage to help the neck pain and felt really dense and swollen up behind my ear, so I get up to check in the mirror and that when I see how swollen it\u2019s gotten which it wasn\u2019t even noticeable the day before unless I didn\u2019t pay much attention? I feel I would have definitely noticed considering the size. Now like I said I got up about 20mins ago to pee and it\u2019s gotten even bigger and worse in pain and I also just noticed my right ear is bruised.  I know now everything is getting progressively worse quite fast and I should go get it checked but I\u2019m scared it\u2019s more than just swollen lymph node/tumour and the cost considering I\u2019m a permanent resident not a citizen.

{"prompt": "How does travelling at or close to the speed of light slow down the rate at which your body decays (age), compared to someone that is stationary? Is this actually the case or is it that the person going at or near the speed of light is not moving through \"time\" at the same rate?  If the latter is true, why and how does this occur?", "preferred": ">Is this actually the case ...If the latter is true  What you're asking about is time dilation in special relativity, and it's very real. And it doesn't even have to be close to the speed of light to be measurable. Time dilation is always present between any two frames of reference that have some velocity relative to each-other. The effect is just much smaller at slower speeds. Time dilation was experimentally confirmed using atomic clocks on jet airplanes as early as the 1970s, and the atomic clocks in GPS satellites need to be adjusted to account for both the fact that they are moving very fast (special relativity) and that they are experiencing a smaller gravitational pull than is present at the surface of the Earth (general relativity).   -  > how does this occur?   This occurs as a consequence of two facts:  1. The speed of light in vacuum is always measured to be the same speed, regardless of how fast the light source is moving relative to the observer. 2. The Pythagorean theorem.   Wikipedia has a good explanation of how to derive this with a thought experiment involving light on a moving train. Here's a video of someone writing out the same derivation.  -   >Is this actually the case or is it that the person going at or near the speed of light is not moving through \"time\" at the same rate?  I'm not really sure what you mean by \"moving through time,\" so I'll sort of explain some things around that.   The first thing to understand about time dilation is that, no matter what, an observer will never notice anything funny about their own time. They don't see *themselves* as being in slow motion. It's only *other reference frames* that are moving with some velocity relative to them that they observe time moving more slowly.   Second, it's not just their body that's effected, as your post title implies. *Everything* is effected by time dilation. Any kind of \"clock\" you can imagine, including the half-life of radioactive particles, appears slower in a reference frame that's moving with respect to yours.   Third, (as some other comments here have mentioned) it's not that time is moving slowly for one observer but not the other. *Both observers* perceive the other's clocks as running more slowly than their own. It's only when one observer decelerates, turns around, accelerates, and decelerates again to meet back up with the first observer that they find one of them has aged more than the other. The actual twin paradox is understanding why that is, not just the existence of time dilation.  -  If you're interested in learning more, MinutePhysics has a series on relativity.", "rejected": ">Is this actually the case or is it that the person going at or near the speed of light is not moving through \"time\" at the same rate?    \"moving through time\" isn't a thing.

{"prompt": "CMV: The diversity added into Amazon's Wheel of Time series added nothing, and was a net loss for the show. I want to start by saying that I'm a full hearted supporter of adding diversity into screen adaptations of stories from other media. I consider diversity to be of benefit in its own right. Diversity for its own sake is a positive thing.  That said, the diversity Amazon added to Wheel of Time was a net loss for the story and the show. I'll discuss two examples here: the gender of the potential Dragon Reborn, and the racial diversity of Emond's Field, the Two rivers, and the world writ large. Neither of these additions added more than they detracted from the story, and both were unnecessary. It's been a while since I read the books, so if I miss a detail, let me know. Also, feel free to bring up other examples besides these two.  To start with, gender diversity isn't something lacking in the Wheel of Time. That I can think of now, there are between 6 and 8 main protagonists, depending on where you draw the line; 3 male, and either 3 or 5 female. The rest of the story suffers no shortage of female representation either, the vast majority of the rest of the characters our protagonists interact with are women. The Aes Sedai, by far the most powerful faction of sorts in the world is made up very exclusively of women. A huge percentage of the most important secondary and tertiary characters in the books are from this group, as well as some extremely important female characters we haven't met yet in the show, so I won't discuss them here in the body of the post in order to avoid spoilers. So, when the writers of the show decided to open up the possibility of the Dragon Reborn being a woman, they didn't add a needed element of diversity.  They did, however, muddy a very important detail in the saga of the Dragon Reborn: that the Aes Sedai have been preparing for a Dragon that would not and could not *ever* be one of them. They would never be able to exert direct control of him. For 3000 years the Aes Sedai have planned and plotted and positioned so that when the Dragon Reborn came, they would have the ability to entangle him and create the circumstances they wanted at the end. This also came with the added promise that regardless of who exactly the Dragon Reborn is, their use of the male half of the one power would all but inevitably drive him insane. The debate over how to handle his reemergence was one of the most important and hotly debated topics for millennia. Some thought it would be best to kidnap him, and prevent him from using his abilities until the very end, thus preserving his sanity. Some thought it would be best to try to teach him to resist the insanity, and train him as best they could to harness his strength. While not a huge thing, the hope for the Aes Sedai that they could simply absorb a female Dragon Reborn (as certainly would have been their plan, one which they would have succeeded at) feels like a loss of history and storytelling.   Bigger than that though is the racial diversity the creators foisted upon the Emond's Field and the rest of the world. Like with gender representation, racial representation and diversity isn't in any way missing from the world of Wheel of Time. We visit all parts of the world, and like our own world, each region and country has a predominant race and culture that mirrors those we have here in reality. This is where I might mess some things up, especially given that none of these comparisons are explicitly expressed in the books, but rather easy-to-make inferences based on skin color, culture, and architecture. Tear is largely Arabic, Sheinar is largely southeast Asian, Illian is largely east African, Saldea is largely Persian, Cairhien is largely eastern European, Ghealdon is largely northwest African/Spanish, Andor is largely western European, and the Aiel are largely pre-European colonization North American - albeit with red hair. The list goes on, but I think you get the picture. Of course, very few areas, and especially cities are entirely homogenous, but just like a white person would stick out in Kyoto, a black person would stick out in Amadacia.  The intershuffling of races just wasn't at all necessary, and really took a chunk out of the credibility of one of Moiraine's first important statements, \"The blood of Manetheren runs deep in the Two Rivers.\" The Two Rivers and Especially Emond's Field is *extremely* homogenous. It's a town of only a couple hundred people, and virtually no one ever leaves or moves there. Some people living outside of Emond's Field in the Two Rivers don't even know it exists. How am I supposed to believe that all of the inhabitants of Emond's Field are directly descended from Manetheren when they're all of clearly divergent ancestry? If the creators wanted to say that Manetheren was itself diverse, make everyone in Emond's Field mixed race. Not a difficult solution, and far better for the world building. If you're worried that doing so would make all the protagonists look more or less the same, don't.  More important though, is that for a show that will jump back and forth across the world constantly, diversifying every country on the map makes it a lot harder for the audience to know where the hell the scene on screen is taking place. They have a *ton* of ground to cover, both figuratively and literally, in telling even the very watered down version they plan to. Every second counts, and the characters all move around a lot, but now we'll either lose time to wide angle shots of each location every time, or simply won't know where we are half the time.  Please use the spoiler button if you want to talk specifics that haven't yet been covered in the show.", "preferred": "I wont discuss the issue you have with the gender of the dragon reborn because I do agree that it was an intentional sacrifice to add to the \"mystery\" of who the dragon was. I didn't like it so I'm not going to argue in favor of it.  &#x200B;  What I will say though is that you're thinking about this entirely from a point of view that lacks any practicality or knowledge of the entertainment industry as well as a practical understanding of the difference in medium and art form.  &#x200B;  So first lets talk about ethnicity and your assertion that it was a net bad for the show and didn't serve any purpose(other than perhaps your implication that it was purely for the sake of diversity/inclusiveness). This an Amazon production, and American company making a show for primarily American audiences. America is an ethnically diverse place where people LIKE to see people like themselves represented on screen. This isn't a conspiracy or woke bullshit, its marketing, its largely liked and the only argument against it is simply that \"I don't believe these are a single ethnic group of people and that makes it harder to believe\".       People will often make this argument and on the surface it seems valid, I myself had those feelings originally when people were bickering about the Witcher's choice to be more diverse, but then once I started thinking more about it I began to realize that we are not very consistent on what we want to be \"accurate\" Cinema and by extension television is never going to be \"accurate\" except perhaps in wartime movies, but even those have many inaccuracies for the sake of watch-ability, cost or convenience. Hiring, shooting, planning shit where everyone has to be ethnically similar is a huge barrier and cost to these shows. You cant just find the best person for the part you have to find the best person for the part that also \"looks ethnically accurate\". Sure in shows with 5-10 primary characters that's fine, but you mentioned yourself ALL the places the show has to go, all the different \"ethnicities\" that would need to be completely homogeneous.   You're in Saldea? Everyone there HAS to be Persian, which means finding dozens/scores of Persian actors TO GET ON SET, multiply that for every single city and every single \"ethnically homogeneous group\". That would take so much more time energy and MONEY and that actually provides very little value, you could argue that doing so would be a huge WASTE of resources because all you're getting is the approval of the most hardcore fans who know exactly what Jordan based those people on.  &#x200B;  Can you honestly say that all the extra time effort and energy to insure all the people were \"ethnically accurate\" would have made the show better at the cost of something else? worse sets, worse costumes, worse actors? They spent every dollar they had to make the show, so if you wanted MORE you have to sacrifice something. What other cost would you have scarified in order to pay for the burden of \"accuracy\"?", "rejected": "Two things. Two and a half, I guess.  One, making it a mystery who the dragon reborn could be is a very easy way to set up Nynaeve and Egwen as extremely powerful. You might've noticed that the show has a much, *much* faster pace - they need to get on with it. Perrin very obviously isn't the Dragon Reborn, since he already displays other powers. Mat was ruled out when he was cured by Moiraine. But to keep it more exciting, the option was left open - and since the whole plot about the Aes Sedai scheming for the dragon reborn isn't in the show that also isn't an issue.  Two, the Two Rivers being predominantly non white makes Rand stick out like a sore thumb, which in my opinion is great. He's a very obvious outsider. In the books, his only defining feature that sets him apart is his red hair, but that is barely noticeable on screen (as in, not something anyone will pay attention to). This was probably not the reason they went with this decision, but it doesn't detract from the believability.  Two point five, the people of the Two Rivers don't have names that fit into Andor *at all*. Andor is largely based on England - with names taken directly or indirectly from the Le Morte D'Arthur, for example. Someone named \"Al'Vere\", I think it was, doesn't fit into that at all anyway."}
{"prompt": "How to fix salty curry after it's already been mixed with rice? I accidentally used two tablespoons of salt instead of two teaspoons for pork vindaloo. Unfortunately, I already divided up the curry and mixed it with the rice for meal prep purposes, so I don't think I can dilute it with water at this point without making the rice soggy. Is there anything I can add at this point to fix this?", "preferred": "You have several options here:   1) Add any kind of citric acid. Easiest is to liberally squeeze lime/lemon juice and mix it in, or add beaten yogurt/raita. A vindaloo is still gonna be good even if it's more tangy/sour.   2) Of course you can also add more rice to reduce the saltiness.   3) Adding extra potatoes in curry is also a good way to soak up/distribute excess salt more evenly. I'd dice some potatoes, shallow fry while covering it so it's cooked through, add in the pork vindaloo/rice, and mix thoroughly.   A combination of all 3 methods above will produce the most effective result. All the best, OP!", "rejected": "How hot is the Vindaloo?

{"prompt": "If you forget something permanently, it's like it never happened. How am I aware that I'm conscious right now if I'm definitely going to die? I just posted this on /r/nostupidquestions and was told to post it here. I actually felt it was too dumb for this sub because I've never got a good reaction from anyone I've asked and I feel I'm missing something obvious that everyone else gets.   You can read further clarification of my thoughts in the other thread on my profile.  Okay so  Once I die I won't be anything anymore, and my brain won't serve as a host for memories, therefore it will be like I never lived from my perspective.   How am I able to be conscious right now and confirm to myself I'm remembering each second if I'm going to die one day? This thought has crept up in my brain for the last 10 years and I always get the same response.  \"because you're alive right now and not dead yet\"   Is it just me who thinks that doesn't make sense given what I've explained? I don't understand", "preferred": "OP, it seems to me you're having some confusion about a few different issues here. Many of them are the biggest questions in philosophy i.e. the question of time, the hard problem of consciousness etc.  However, based on your own description here we can definitely unpack it to help you understand it better.  >Once I die I won't be anything anymore, and my brain won't serve as a host for memories, therefore it will be like I never lived from my perspective.  If we take a phenomenological perspective, i.e. the perspective of 'your' experience, then yes this is true. However, of course if you move slightly beyond subjectivism we'd have to say the other consciousnesses are also aware of your existence. Simondon's theory of psychic-collective individuation would argue that individual consciousnesses never exist without a process that involves other beings. As would the common sense scientific view. Nevertheless, if you're talking about purely your subjective experience this statement is likely true.  >How am I able to be conscious right now and confirm to myself I'm remembering each second if I'm going to die one day? This thought has crept up in my brain for the last 10 years and I always get the same response.  Here's where it gets tricky. Essentially what you're doing here is, as another commenter noted, engaging in what Heidegger called 'projection'. You're imaging the possibility for your non-existence. However, in the case of death, this possibility is a necessity. As beings in the world we all must have the ability to project our non-being, our death. This is an interesting topic to get into but I think it's a little bit different to what you're asking.  Essentially the problem you have here is that you're asking \"if I'm going to die in the future and all my memories will be gone, how can I be sure I exist right now?\" The simple answer is that the projection of your future affects the *quality* of your present experience, but it doesn't determine the *being* of your present experience. In other words, you understanding that you will die, and thus all your memories will disappear etc. affects the way you think about the past, the present and the future, but it isn't the condition for your experience. The fact that you will die (in the future) and stop experiencing/remembering does not mean you have never lived/experienced/remembered in (the present).  Now personally, I think you're probably trying to get at something that is a little more complicated than the way you've laid it out here (I've read through your comments too). Imo, my best advice would be to perhaps watch some videos on Heidegger's ideas of projection and death. Check out the Stanford entry on Heidegger.  For a counter perspective, and one you might find quite interesting given how you seem to be looking for an ontological concept of memory, you should have a look into Bergson. His book Matter and Memory is explicitly concerned with the questions you're asking. Bergson distinguishes recollection from 'pure memory' which is essentially like an objective past where all things go once they pass from the present (as you said).  The great thing about philosophy is that many questions you have about the nature of consciousness or time or anything else have likely been thought out in a lot of detail by philosophers throughout history. If you're willing to devote a little time to trying to understand your own question through philosophy you might find the answers you're looking for.", "rejected": "As far as I can tell, everyone else I have ever met has the feeling that consciousness exists and operates *in time*. I have been in a coma as a result of a car accident. There are 7 days of my life that I have no memory of, and yet, I understand that they had a profound impact on my life because I understand that I necessarily exist with an experience that manifests from one moment to the next, whether those moments are relative to each or not and whether distance and time are the same, and whether they are constructs of our consciousness. If it was the case that we experienced time as it is, i.e., sans experienced change, then I think your conception would be right. Without a conception of time, if I die, then I am not.  &#x200B;  As much as I dislike Kant, I like his conceptions of time and space as they relate to the phenomenal realm (the realm humans experience). Even if they aren't exactly right, they're close enough to find the origin of many conscious experiences in. I'm thinking of Kant's *Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics* here."}

{"prompt": "Why have humans only evolved in Eastern Africa? Why did humans evolve in Eastern Africa? Why didn\u2019t we begin to evolve from MCRA (most common recent ancestor) in Asia or South America or anywhere else in earth? I would like to know what makes Eastern Africa so special? Are there some sort of special conditions there that are optimal for evolution?", "preferred": "Nothing was \u201cspecial\u201d about the region per say. In a certain sense, that\u2019s just where it happened; that\u2019s where all the right variables and factors aligned to produce the specific outcome. It goes without saying thats where our ancestors were (where they evolved), so that obviously paved the way for humans. Homo sapiens are part of a long chain of the Homo genus, most of which happened to be present in and around Sub-Saharan Africa. Homo sapiens began as a small band that became more successful over time, ultimately outperforming members of its same genus. It would\u2019ve been impossible for groups of sapiens to spawn simultaneously around the globe because the exact same ancestral chain would\u2019ve also had to exist in other continents.   All continents, while wildly different, also have many similar climatological and geological characteristics across space, so I\u2019m not sure there are any profound arguments as to what makes that region particularly special (I could be wrong). My understanding of human migration is we originated in East, Sub-Saharan Africa (conducive to any life with its diversity of flora and fauna, as well as the accessibility of water) and subsequently migrated out of Africa to modern day Asia, over the Bering Strait and into the Americas. Although as of late, the Bering Strait Theory has come into major question, newer theories of human migration into the Americas would still follow the same sort of patterns, but would include the use of maritime technology that was previously considered nonexistent for that respective time period. The great thing about Anthropology  and Archeology is there are always new discoveries that transform our own history, and who knows, maybe one day we\u2019ll learn how humans actually originated in South America or something. But as far as we know, and as far as the evidence suggests, we have a pretty solid understanding of what happened.", "rejected": "I believe it to be just a matter of survival of the fittest. The Homo sapiens species that evolved in East Africa was so well adapted to not only that particular environment but nearly all environments that it rapidly expanded across the globe, supplanting other species in the process due to its astounding survival success. It's possible that, in another timeline, the species could have evolved elsewhere, or even experience concurrent evolution in more than one location, but that's not what happened."}

I made a sample last weekend for my husband and I to try to make sure it would be good, but it was not.  I'm looking for help.  My problems:  My friend gave me a bag of frozen, cooked shrimp to use for the salad.  We thought the shrimp was blah flavored and a little tough.

{"prompt": "CMV: The Rayshard Brooks shooting was a tragic loss of human life but mostly justified by his actions. Ok, I almost guarantee this has been posted on here before but after I skimmed the \u201cnew\u201d section for a few minutes I didn\u2019t see it so I figured sure why not.   I\u2019m gonna start this by saying I completely stand behind BLM and the peaceful protests across America and the world in their fight for equal rights and just protection under the law. I think there are many instances of police brutality and blatant homicide by LEO but this is not a very good example. Im just gonna break it down from my POV to start. the confrontation started with them politely asking a man to move his car out of the drive through because it was in the way of everyone else. After he failed a sobriety test, clearly showing he was drunk, they did what they\u2019re taught to do and calmly tell him he\u2019s under arrest and that he needs to come with them. As they surround him to put him in handcuffs, not showing any kind of aggression or hostility that is common among LEO, he tries to shake both of them off.   He proceeds to physically engage both officers, punching them and throwing them off him, they discharge their tasers but he seems relatively unaffected. He then steals one and manages to get by both officers, running away. He points the taser at the officer chasing him and the officer shoots him to stop him.   It\u2019s tragic, no doubt, and to be fair I\u2019m not even trying to defend the officer, he deserves some reprimand for his actions but he shouldn\u2019t be charged with multiple, serious offenses leading to many years of jail time. I think yes, the situation could\u2019ve been handled much better, and he should be fired for his hasty actions but I think there is a place where we need to draw the line.   In my eyes, the officer, highly trained and armed, is taught to stop the criminal no matter what, in his eyes, this man just drove drunk, assaulted two officers, stole a taser, and attempted to discharge the weapon on another officer. A weapon that has been described by the state as potentially deadly and which, he has been told to take as a direct threat. I don\u2019t think this is not so much on the officer rather the system and the state.   I\u2019m not trying to discredit the protests or their fight, nor even this mans life. I completely respect all of those, but I mean, what was he supposed to do? He didn\u2019t have a secondary weapon, he wasn\u2019t likely to catch him on foot, I think, again, it\u2019s excessive, and he should be fired, but his alternatives was to watch a criminal run away with a \u201clethal\u201d weapon. You can even hear him on the video trying to say things to brooks like \u201cstay with me\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t stop breathing\u201d so I definitely don\u2019t think it\u2019s a lack of moral or humanity on the part of the officer.   Tbh I\u2019ve had it explained so many different ways, I\u2019m not even sure what to think rn, but this is the best way I think I can put it from my view.

Once you have begun the action your brain has a sort of delay to where stopping while performing the action won't be possible until maybe 2 or 3 seconds afterward. My thinking is that when Rayshard had fired off the taser at the police officers the officer who began to fire was experiencing this mental delay.

I graduated with a mechanical engineering degree about a year ago, fizzing with excitement thinking about all the opportunities I'd have to take on interesting, challenging problems and solve them with all my newly-acquired skills and expertise. Since I graduated, I've been working for a consulting company in an industry I was really excited about and I'm.....bored. The interesting parts of this job aren't challenging, the challenging parts aren't interesting, and I'm constantly racing the clock trying to get hastily-designed parts out the door.   &#x200B;  So I've been casting my eyes about for new opportunities, but the city I live in isn't exactly an engineering hub (yes, I know I can just move, but I have young kids and a wife who loves it here, so it's not quite as simple as packing up my pocket protectors and hopping in the car), which leads me back to the title question - are you/do you know someone with an engineering degree who works in a field outside of, or adjacent to, engineering?

Client representation is the top of the food chain and usually people in that position have at least a couple of decades in experience or higher level education, the project manager would be squirming when confronted with a client inspector because the position is automatically way higher.   Consultancy while they get to boss the contractor and sub-contractor around they are unfortunately the first one to be slapped by the client, I know many who'll lose their job on the tiniest mistake so i don't recommend going into it.  The main contractor needs to meet deadlines which could lead to insane hours of work and finally mep subcontracting is the least headache because you just comply with whoever is paying you and call it a day but the pay is the worst."}
{"prompt": "Weekly discussion - Shopping at the Asian grocery Most every American city, and a surprising number of smaller towns, has at least one grocery store catering to the local east Asian community. Mostly stocked with Chinese ingredients, but often with a good supply of Korean or Japanese products depending on the local demographics, with very little labeled in English, they can be mysterious and intimidating for non-Asians who want to broaden their culinary horizons.  This week, I'd like to assemble a guide for those who are considering venturing to their local Asian grocery for the first time.   What ingredients are worth making the trip for? What are your shopping strategies to ensure you come home with the makings of a meal? Do you have advice on soliciting help from staff with whom you don't share a language? How do you make sense of the array of soy sauces?   And for actual Asian redditors, if there's a small American grocery in your city, how do you shop there?", "preferred": "I was born, raised, and still currently living in Southern California to two Taiwanese immigrant parents. I think my experiences are typical of the kind you find in ethnic Asian neighborhoods.  > What ingredients are worth making the trip for?   * Some of the more common ingredients are so cheap at the Asian markets around here. I mean, I can stumble into any supermarket and pick up tofu, but at the Asian markets, I can grab a block for just over a dollar. Also being charged 50 cents for a bundle of green onions at the local market feels like I'm being cheated out of my money, because at the Asian markets I'm paying 10 cents per bundle.   * Fish. Yeah I know it smells. But unless I feel like waaaaay overpaying by going to a fisherman's market, I can't get fresher fish. The fish at the 99 Ranch around here is usually fresher than the ones at the local Whole Foods. Also, I like to buy whole fish or fish heads - things I can't typically seem to get at any western market. And again, the price can't be beat - one big salmon head will be enough to make a huge pot of spicy fish head stew that will feed a family of four, and it would cost me maybe four dollars.   * Then you get the more obscure ingredients that you can't find anywhere else. I'll just list a few of the things I picked up during my last trip there that I don't think I can find at the neighborhood Albertsons: Black wood ear fungus, preserved chili tofu, kong xin cai, uncooked boba, tong hao cai (which are amongst my favorite ingredients to throw into a hot pot by the way), spicy bean paste.   * Baked goods. I'm a huge fan of various buns stuffed with taro, pork sung, red bean, and various custards and creams, and the coconut toast I can pick up at the 99 ranch makes for amazing French toast when dried out over night.   > Do you have advice on soliciting help from staff with whom you don't share a language?   In my experience, you'll have better luck with asking other customers that look like they know what they're doing. If you know exactly what you want, and they can understand you, the employees will be more than happy to help you out. Generally though, if you're asking for help, one of the two above conditions won't be satisfied.

{"prompt": "Can I do an overnight rise for all bread doughs? I like the idea of doing a cold rise for my bread since it spreads out the work over a couple of days instead of 1. I know you have to let the dough rise once, then again after shaping.  My questions: Can I just stick any bread dough in the fridge for an overnight bulk fermentation (then shape and proof again at room temp the next day). Will I have to adjust the recipe? Could I also shape them and keep in the fridge overnight? How long is too long in the fridge?   New to bread, so lots of questions... thanks!", "preferred": "You can, but your results will vary. Some bread doughs are more delicate and won't be very happy after a night in the fridge. Some doughs aren't designed for the flavor development that happens with long proofs.   For most doughs, the best way to overnight proof is after shaping, though. Bulk proof, divide and shape, then refrigerate. The reason for this is the purpose of the first proof is to allow the yeast to start developing. Yeast develops exponentially and restricting that growth early in the process (like by refrigerating) can kill off so much of the yeast that there isn't enough left to rise the bread.  I would not leave your bread under refrigeration for more than 48 hours but 24 would be preferred. Over 24 and you'll start seeing more signs of aging, slower proofing, and less oven spring.  Once you remove your bread from refrigeration, you want to let it come to room temperature and finish rising if necessary. Depending on the temperature of your fridge and how active your dough is, you may not need to let it rise any further.", "rejected": "I have a question regarding this too \u2014 should I always let my dough come to room temp before baking if I proofed it in the fridge for the second rise?

Try to get to conferences they attend and get points of contact. Pick and choose specific companies you are interested and focus on them. Figure out who are some higher ups.

If it catches their eye, they pass it down the chain to HR who generally give it significant weight.  If you know someone in the company, pump them for information.

{"prompt": "How do you define work/life balance? So I'm an entry level mechanical engineer, been working as an EIT for over 2 years now. My company is very flexible when it comes to hours worked, but of course us salaried employees have to get at least 40 hours.  Part of my performance evaluation a while ago, my boss indirectly told me that I should be working more than 40 hours. Now I don't think he's a bad boss, but I think I'm being unfairly compared to the senior engineers that regularly work 50-60 hours every week. This being my first job out of college, I didn't want to argue with him about it.   But the whole time we were having that conversation, I was thinking what the hell. Is 40 hours not enough these days? I'm a young, fairly inexperienced EIT. This means I don't have a ton of responsibilities, i.e. managing projects or leading the design teams on huge projects. So if I'm getting my work done on time & meeting my deadlines, why should I be working more than 40 hours?  Of course, there are days or even weeks when it's crunch time & in the past I've worked over 50 hours before, but that's pretty rare. To me, maintaining a work/life balance is very important - I don't want to drown myself in work just because that was the norm for the previous generation.  Is this common across other companies?

{"prompt": "CMV: If you are a high school student who wants to reduce the chances of a shooting at your school, inviting the guy who is going to shoot up the school to participate in your life is likely to be much more effective than walking out of school to protest gun laws. Staging a walkout to bring attention to gun laws and get congress to enact some ambiguously defined \"common sense gun control\" legislation is unlikely to have *any* impact whatsoever.  If nothing was done after Sandy Hook when Democrats were in power, I'm not sure why you think protesting is going to bring chance while Republicans are in power.  What *could* have a significant impact, especially at your particular school, is to reach out to the guy who is going to be shooting up the school and include him in your life.  Whenever a school shooting occurs, the students are rarely surprised at who the shooter is.  Take a poll of 20 students at your average high school, and you're going to hear the same 2-3 names come up over and over and over again again when asking \"who is most likely to shoot up the school\".  Kids are still bullied, ostracized and dehumanized just as much today as they were in 1999. It's been 20 years and we've tried to blame video games, mental health and gun accessibility. We still haven't addressed the core issued: People being dicks to each other.  Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, Red Lake, Columbine and now Parkland. These shootings aren't being done by the popular starting football quarterback. They're being done by the guy who is pushed in the hallway. They guy who is laughed at, or worse, when he dares to smile at or talk to a girl. The guy who teachers would rather exclude from the classroom than reach out to and help.  More succinctly, the guy who is treated like a bug being squashed on the sidewalk, rather than being treated as an actual human being.  If the other students made a point to include that person in life, rather than continuing to ostracize, mock and humiliate him, the likelihood of him shooting up the school is going to drop significantly.  Invite him over to play video games.  Ask him to join you at McDonald's after the game.  Be a positive influence in his life.  Kids that are included in high school life don't shoot up the school.  Kids that have a friend group don't shoot up the school.  Kids that are treated as human beings don't shoot up the school.  Kids that are treated as less-than-human shoot up the school.", "preferred": "While this might work with \"poor, innocent bullied boy who's desperate and hurt\" mass murder types, it will not work with true sociopaths.

You advocate that people put up with this, not ostracize him, force themselves to spend time with him, etc. Have you considered that if they give up and can't take his cruel behavior anymore, THEY will be the direct targets because *they* knew the shooter best and were the ones who \"betrayed\" him? That they've made themselves and their school the target, instead of someone or somewhere else?  It's also worth considering that the social ostracization that occurs if you're the nutcase who brings drugs or a gun/knife to school serves as a deterrent.

{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old: English is spoken all over the world by so many people, but why do we English-speakers seem to not speak any other language fluently but English? Is it only because other countries are forced to learn English in school? Why do people all over the world speak English so well, but Americans and Englishpeople seem to not speak any other language but English?", "preferred": "This goes back to the British Empire.   By 1901 the British Empire was the biggest empire the world had ever seen with Colonies is Canada, Africa, India, Egypt and Australia with Queen Victoria being the nominal ruler of over a quarter of the World's People...long story short, lots of people spoke English.  So English became a Lingua Franca, a trade language. Basically, rather than traders from 10 different counties all learning 10 different languages to communicate with each other, they communicated in English, because that way they only had to learn one other language which was the dominant language at the time.  This continues today: I work for a French multinational company, and even though a meeting or conference call might have people from 6 or 7 different nationalities in it, it will be conducted in English even if there are no native English speakers present...it's the language all the other countries can speak.  So, basically,the reason a lot of native English speakers don't speak other languages is simply because we don't really need to.", "rejected": "Haven't seen this answer yet but from my traveling experiences in Europe it seems almost necessary to be bi/tri-lingual with all the different nations packed so closely together.

{"prompt": "The decision to euthanize my kitten is destroying me I have a 6 month old kitten named Bubbles. He was originally a foster who had \u201cpneumonia\u201d but when he wasn\u2019t improving I adopted him so I could take over his medical care.   After seeing 4 vets, including specialists, multiple xrays, blood work, and cardiology appointments, it was determined that he has an entire host of congenital defects. His lungs completely lack blood flow in the front, his heart has a bad valve, he has bone marrow issues, and kidney issues.   The thing is, he behaves like he\u2019s perfectly fine. He plays and runs and jumps and purrs. He\u2019s adorable and full of fun. The vet said he behaves this way because his defects are all he\u2019s ever known so he is used to feeling bad. But the vet also said that as he grows, his body will struggle more and that he is a ticking time bomb for catastrophic health failure and that he likely wouldn\u2019t die instantly but suffer before we could get him to the vet. She said it\u2019s not if but when and could happen anytime.  I love him so much. I don\u2019t want to euthanize him. But he is becoming sexually mature and we can\u2019t neuter him because he wouldn\u2019t survive anesthesia. He\u2019s starting to get pissy to our other cats. But also, I\u2019m constantly afraid for him, I dread the moment that he begins to suffer and hurt. Every time he is out of my sight I wonder if he\u2019s in a corner gasping for air.  Some people in my life have said I should wait to euthanize until he is suffering. The vet said with all of his issues it is appropriate to euthanize at any point, and this has been confirmed by 4 other vets. My thinking is that I\u2019d rather his last day be a happy day and not one where he is in agony. I am considering calling the mobile vet to come to our house to euthanize in the next week or so.  I\u2019m literally gutted by this. I don\u2019t know what plan is right. He can\u2019t survive his issues and they can\u2019t be treated. Do I euthanize before he declines or give him every good day he can have?  I just need some words of wisdom. I\u2019m paralyzed by grief and indecision.", "preferred": "I'm so sorry you are going through this. It is an extremely unfair situation for anyone involved, and it still seems as if you've been doing the best you can. Very few pet parents go through the ordeal of seeking four \"second opinions\" for their animal's condition, and I truly do empathize for your extremely difficult journey.   From the language in your post, it seems like you understand euthanasia is going to be the most likely end for Bubbles. If his body could fail at any moment now, the stressors of continued growth and development could very well cause his physical condition and pain level deteriorate. Your vet said much the same, so I won't dwell on that any longer.   As a vet tech I feel, for cases in which the animal's condition will never improve beyond their current state, the most humane option is to euthanize early. This sounds very harsh, and I apologize again, but at this stage you are still able to control for their level of happiness and make at least one, final day of good memories. You can still give them special meals, take them to their favorite places, and simply sit, quietly, and hold them while they sleep. A person's animal doesn't know or understand why these things are happening to them, but they do understand the depth of their person's love. These things are no longer possible when that animal comes to us as an emergency, and I think the absence of those final, good memories makes it much more difficult for an animal's person to find closure.   The final decision remains yours, in the end. You seem to have a lot of empathy for Bubbles' condition, and your heart will tell you what is right. If you do decide euthanasia is the best course of action for Bubbles, please understand that we will be with you every step of the way. We will do our best to make the environment safe and comfortable, and we will wait until you are truly ready before we begin. If you are not able to remain in the room at the end, we will hold them and love them as if they were our own. Everybody cries, it never gets any easier, and we never forget the animals we help cross the bridge - but we will carry the burden together, knowing their time was peaceful and loving rather than scary or painful.

{"prompt": "How quickly can a manufacturer work out the average time-to-failure for a new mechanical product, like a washing machine? Especially when that product is expected to last many years? Say I design a new washing machine that I *hope* will last the customer 20 years without needing to call a repair man. I want to truthfully advertise its longer-than-average lifespan as a way of increasing sales and justifying a higher price tag, so I need to get evidence for its actual expected lifespan.   I could make several machines and run them continuously for 20-years equivalent use, but it would take me over a year to assess (~10 hours use per week; 10*52*20= 10,400 hours = 432 days) Is there a quicker way to accurately predict the average lifespan that won't delay my new product launch by 14 months?  I read the wiki on Weibull statistics and honestly got lost in the math. I also read the wiki on reliability engineering but, without going down the Wikipedia rabbit hole, I couldn't find out *how much* faster a manufacturer could assess time-to-failure than by simply running the machine for thousands of hours.", "preferred": "I worked for an automotive R&D center for 6 years and then consumer good development for 4 years after that and have some insight on each.  First, automotive there are a few different types of failures.  UV testing, corrosion testing, and other environmental can be highly accelerated and design and manufacturing guidelines developed to ensure reliability.  Salt spray and UV booths can put years of damage into parts in days.  And processes like submerging the entire frame in the coating can ensure far better coverage than a human with a spray gun.  UV can be negated with additives in plastic which is ensured with things like the company developing their own plastic mixes and providing it to the supplier instead of trusting the supplier to source a material that meets the spec.  Mechanical components are a bit trickier but can be tested on a test jig every few seconds instead of once per day or so.  So a damper on a glove box to shocks on the suspension will have performance data from suppliers with a good track record and extensive documentation.  A new variation won\u2019t have as much of its own specific testing but it can be compared to older models on a part by part and overall basis to determine what weak points might have been introduced.  Something like engines are often essentially designed to practically never wear out.  Any parts that will wear will have a maintenance schedule, and something like the engine block should ideally never fail under normal operation.  No company is going to design an engine on a car to wear out  at 150,000 miles just because the warranty ends at 100,000 miles.  The risk or early failure and bad reputation is nowhere near being worth the amount they would save skimping on materials and quality.  On the opposite end of that spectrum, emergency jacks are called emergency jacks for a reason, they are really just intended for emergencies and are sometimes rated for as few as 20 uses since they should only ever be used for changing a time.  Now likely most of them will last longer than that to ensure that most will hit that number safely, but for parts like that it isn\u2019t worth the cost and weight to put something more robust in when that cost and weight can be used elsewhere.  For home goods, I would perform a lifespan calculation based on expected frequency of use and expected longevity of the product from a consumer standpoint.  If you buy a blender and use it once per week, you probably expect that thing to last decades.  If you are crushing ice and mixing thick smoothies 4 times per day every day all year, and you buy a basic consumer version, you will probably understand if it wears out in a couple years.  If you buy a high end professional grade one, you expect that to last for decades.  Now if you open a smoothie shop at a mall and make smoothies nonstop for 12 hours per day 7 days per week,  no company is going to honor the consumer rated warranty and you will probably be replacing that thing every year or so.  Try that with a cheap consumer model and you might kill it in the first day or week.  If It is a brushed motor that is a fairly easy measurement.  Are the brushes consumer replaceable?  If not, you can easily test how long it takes to burn through those brushes.  Dishwasher cycle testing is another common test.  Many plastics can become brittle or warp under cycled high heat of a dishwasher, so run parts through a 100 or so cycles depending on expected use cases.", "rejected": "Accelerated life testing, HALT testing, and making predictions."}

{"prompt": "Can someone thoroughly explain dialectical materialism? It's quite a tricky topic to wrap my head around despite the vast resources available to understanding it (don't resort to any links that will only hinder my comprehension of the concept)", "preferred": "Forgive me for finding this amusing, but this kind of like asking someone to \"thoroughly explain\" differential calculus or oxidation/reduction reactions. It's non-trivial and probably requires one hell of a lot of background.   But what the hell. It's a slow afternoon.  The \"dialectical\" part is a reference to Hegel's notion of \"the dialectic.\" Hegel advanced the idea that history is essentially the process of \"Geist\"--the ghost/spirit/mind/consciousness of the world--towards a state of absolute, ultimate, perfect knowledge of itself, the \"universal order\". It does this by the process of the \"dialectic,\" in which one notion (the \"thesis\") is met by a contrary/opposing notion (the \"antithesis\"), and the tension between the two is resolved/merged into a new notion (the \"synthesis\") which in turn becomes the next \"thesis\".  It's not important for you to necessarily get all of that. Hegel is nothing if not dense. What's important to understand is that Hegel thinks that history is essentially an *idealistic* story, in the sense of \"having to do with ideas,\" or at the very least, \"not having to do with physical objects\".  Marx, born about a decade after Hegel published *Phenomenology of Geist*, was a student of Hegelian philosophy. In ridiculously simple terms, Marx took Hegel's notion about the development of history but located that development in the *material* realm rather than the realm of the *ideal*. So for Marx, history is not a story of the development of the \"world spirit,\" but the *material* organization of society, and in particular the progress of class struggle over the means of production. Marx's historiography (and Marxist historiography generally) became known as \"historical materialism,\" the point being to contrast it with Hegel's own views, which might be fairly described as \"historical *idealism*\". Marx (and Engels, for that matter) still wanted to talk about this progression using the \"dialectic\" terminology, though there are various ways of translating Hegel's notions from the realm of the ideal to the realm of the material.   So what's \"dialectical materialism\" then? The term is most commonly used to refer to the version of historical materialism developed primarily in the Soviet Union and epitomized in the writings of Joseph Stalin in the 1930s. It incorporates developments in Marxist thought from the intervening decades since Marx and Engels first started publishing (the late 1840s, basically), including ideas from Lenin and Lukacs as well as Marx and Engels.", "rejected": "Dialectical materialism is, in simple, a systematic means of understanding reality. It functions as the theoretical basis for Marxist theory (whereas the practical basis is being a communist). A good example of the application of dialectical materialism is historical materialism (which is arguably much easier to understand). Also worth noting that the term 'dialectical materialism' itself wasn't coined until Kautsky after Marx and Engels' death.  I don't know if you are adverse to quotes, given your final parenthesis, but I would find them the complete opposite of 'hindering' to your comprehension of the concept:  \"It is an eternal cycle in which matter moves, a cycle that certainly only completes its orbit in periods of time for which our terrestrial year is no adequate measure, a cycle in which the time of highest development, the time of organic life and still more that of the life of being conscious of nature and of themselves, is just as narrowly restricted as the space in which life and self-consciousness come into operation. A cycle in which every finite mode of existence of matter, whether it be sun or nebular vapour, single animal or genus of animals, chemical combination or dissociation, is equally transient, and wherein nothing is eternal but eternally changing, eternally moving matter and the laws according to which it moves and changes.\" (Engels, Dialectics of Nature, https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch01.htm)    \"Motion is the mode of existence of matter. Never anywhere has there been matter without motion, or motion without matter, nor can there be.\"  \"Change of form of motion is always a process that takes place between at least two bodies, of which one loses a definite quantity of motion of one quality (e.g. heat), while the other gains a corresponding quantity of motion of another quality (mechanical motion, electricity, chemical decomposition).  \"Dialectics, so-called objective dialectics, prevails throughout nature, and so-called subjective dialectics (dialectical thought), is only the reflection of the motion through opposites which asserts itself everywhere in nature, and which by the continual conflict of the opposites and their final passage into one another, or into higher forms, determines the life of nature.\" (same source as above)  \"But dialectical materialism insists on the approximate relative character of every scientific theory of the structure of matter and its properties; it insists on the absence of absolute boundaries in nature, on the transformation of moving matter from one state into another, that from our point of view [may be] apparently irreconcilable with it, and so forth.\" (Lenin, Materialism and Empirico-Criticism, https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1908/mec/05.htm)    \"With each epoch-making discovery even in the sphere of natural science, materialism has to change its form; and after history was also subjected to materialistic treatment, a new avenue of development has opened here, too.   For dialectical philosophy nothing is final, absolute, sacred. It reveals the transitory character of everything and in everything; nothing can endure before it except the uninterrupted process of becoming and of passing away, of endless ascendancy from the lower to the higher.\" (Engels, The End of Classical German Philosophy, https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/index.htm)  If this was not the type of answer you were looking for, please do tell.

The water will most likely be fine after expiry but, in case there is something in there, the expiration date will provide a good idea of how long it will be safe to drink and to safeguard the company from liability."}
{"prompt": "Bounty hunters entered the wrong home I live in California. 7 bounty hunters who were dressed like the swat team who I thought were police the whole time broke my bedroom window while I was asleep (both window panes including a bent outer screen indicating that they pried the screen open before they broke the window) and then came into my home against my will. They told me they were looking for someone with a name I hadn\u2019t ever heard. I don\u2019t know this person and have never seen them a day in my life. I then asked them to show me a picture and again told them I don\u2019t know who tf that is and he doesn\u2019t live here! They told me that they\u2019re coming in regardless of whether I want them to so we can \u201cdo this the easy way or the hard way\u201d. This whole situation was so random and bizarre it\u2019s 1am and I still can\u2019t get past what happened today still has me panicking with anxiety. I have glass in my foot making it hard to walk since I have to limp and just the sheer terror of initially thinking it was a burglar. They all treated me as if I were lying and hiding a boyfriend or something. They kept trying to trip me up in a \u201clie\u201d and I was so confused while they were using dumb police interrogation tactics.  Only me and my 10 year old child live here and they broke his bedroom window which was near my head when I fell asleep in his room but thankfully no cuts in my face. Just my foot and almost my cats paws. As they\u2019re storming my apartment shouting for \u201cLarry so and so\u201d they\u2019re asking me where my child is what his name is what his dads name is and his dads address and all kinds of crazy sh*t! Trying to get all my personal info beyond my name that I gave them. I offered to show them my lease, my USPS informed delivery to show this person gets no mail here and I told them there are cameras where they can easily see he has never been here and isn\u2019t inside. They didn\u2019t identify themselves to me even know I kept referring to them as police since I thought they were but they finally said \u201cwe\u2019re not police\u201d but nothing else. I didn\u2019t know they were bounty hunters until someone told me they were after the fact. I wasn\u2019t given the ability to look at the arrest warrant either to even verify that the address is my address. I looked up the persons info who they\u2019re looking for and it shows an address in another city that an apt building but it shows 5 different apt #\u2019s under his list of previous residences which leads me to believe he lived at both complexes and gave all those random unit #\u2019s out to obviously conceal his real address since he likes to go on the run and not show up to court. They also lied and said that they broke 1 window pane and failed to mention that they broke both but also bent up the screen. They also lied and said that they provided their info yet I don\u2019t know any of their names or what bail company they are so I have no idea how to get my address removed! Otherwise it\u2019ll be an endless cycle of them storming my home looking for a whole stranger. They said that they\u2019re paying for the window so obviously they know they weren\u2019t within their right otherwise they wouldn\u2019t be paying for it. This is criminal to me though because how can they break through my window for someone they have never seen here? They didn\u2019t hear any voices either because I was asleep. I didn\u2019t have the TV on either. Now I\u2019m left with my window still open at 1 in the morning because maintenance at my Apts never showed up and I can\u2019t get this glass out of my foot. Sorry this was long and maybe kind of ranty but thank you for reading all the way through and enlightening me on the law regarding this. The officer I called to make a report simply said \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about bounty hunter laws so you\u2019ll have to call them to see what they \u201cpolicy\u201d is\u201d lmao as if a \u201cpolicy\u201d is above the law and as if they\u2019re going to admit to me that they broke it.   The police offered me No insight in regards to how I go about clearing this address issue up so it doesn\u2019t happen in the future. They all keep saying to call the bail company yet can\u2019t give me the name of it because they say they don\u2019t have it. Even if I did call them how would they remove my address when I\u2019ve already told them face to face that that person doesn\u2019t live here and that I don\u2019t even know them? I\u2019ve already told them this and they don\u2019t believe me so at the end of the day Police are refusing my report for them intentionally breaking the window and they\u2019re not telling me how to prevent it in the future. Literally no one except door dash drivers and uber drivers have my address. I\u2019ve always been private about my home in general. I don\u2019t know why this person used my addess other than me assuming they\u2019re giving a fake address because they never planned on going to court and don\u2019t want county hunters at THEIR door. Smh. Police tell me that they \u201cbroke the window civilly so since there is no intent, it\u2019s not criminal\u201d.

{"prompt": "Whats the difference between frying green and brown plantains?", "preferred": "My family (Cuban on one side) fries both green and brown plantains quite regularly.   Green plantains we generally make into mariquitas (banana chips). Because they are quite starchy, as /u/Jibaro123 mentioned, you have to slice them very thin and fry until they're crispy. You can do these in a frying pan, but we generally do big batches in a deep fryer.  For brown plantains, we slice them on the bias into thicker slabs. These are called maduros. They're sweet and soft and you can fry them easily in just a little oil in a skillet.   Beware that to get good results, you have to stick to the extremes. For mariquitas, the plantains have to be quite green \u2013 if they're too ripe, they don't get crispy and they taste odd. For maduros, the plantains have to be very brown \u2013 so brown that you can't believe they're still good anymore. If you try to make maduros with plantains that aren't ripe enough, you get a tough, starchy thing that's really gross.", "rejected": "I fry green plantains twice. Once while an inch or so think to soften them up and then take it out to smash it. Fry it again. Before the second fry I like to mash up garlic and and then do the second smash over the top of the garlic so it's embedded."}

Now, any creature that will carry on eating while its own rear end is being chewed to bits is, as far as I can see, not conscious or experiencing pain.", "rejected": "From what I remember, bugs don\u2019t have muscles for movement so they move just by the sheer force of pumping their blood through their limbs with every beat.

So you need to clean it well.

Consider what happens if you point a lens at the sun to study it.  The amount of heat that lens is absorbing is going to be carefully modeled and a cooling system devised so the lens never exceeds its operating temperatures.

{"prompt": "Dumb question about car engineering - could you use a flywheel to 'store' energy from the engine, for later use to help accelerate faster? I'm not talking about regenerative braking.  RB uses the brakes to spin up a flywheel.  I'm talking about using an engine to spin up a flywheel.  ---  I was watching some car modding videos today when a thought struck me.  No, I'm not interested in doing this myself.  I'm not even a car guy.  More than anything, I'm wondering why this *isn't* done in racing situations.  I imagine the answer is that it would be too heavy to provide any benefit.  Suppose you're designing a racing car.  The car will be racing in a race where there are periods during which it's *not* accelerating.   - For example - a drag race, where a car sits for *minutes* doing nothing at the starting line, before having to rapidly accelerate.  - For example - a rally, where there are periods when a car's engine has the *capacity* to accelerate more but the driver momentarily wishes to keep the car slower for more control; followed by other periods where the driver wishes to accelerate faster than the engine can allow.  Now suppose you connect the car's engine to a flywheel as well as the car's wheels.  The engine can send the entirety of its power to the wheels by temporarily disconnecting the flywheel.  Somehow, it can also power the wheels a little bit while also spinning up the flywheel.  When the driver requires it, the flywheel can be connected to the wheels, relieving it of its own momentum to spin up the wheels even more.     - On a race's starting line, a driver would use the car's engine to spin up the flywheel.  The moment the lights go green, the driver steps on the gas.  The car's computer connects the engine and the flywheel to the wheels.  The momentum stored in the flywheel allows the car to accelerate much faster than a normal car, whose wheels can only be driven by the engine alone.  - During a period of a rally race where the driver needs to control their speed, the engine might rev up faster than it normally would, for the speed the car's travelling at.  The extra power is sent to the flywheel to spin it up.  The momentum of the flywheel could be used later to help the car accelerate faster when necessary.  This would be similar to regenerative braking, except instead of using the brakes to power the flywheel the engine itself would be used to power the flywheel.    My questions are:   - Is this possible, or is it really dumb?  - Why aren't these systems used in real life?  Is it due to the engineering complexity?  Due to the mass of the flywheel?  - Are there any other places it could be used?  (For example - perhaps it's too heavy for a racing car, but could be useful in a tank.)", "preferred": "This has been tried in buses in the 40s but they were discontinued as there are too many problems with high velocity spinning heavy wheels of death and unwanted gyroscopic forces.", "rejected": "https://www.hybridcars.com/flywheel-hybrids/"}
{"prompt": "Where are the actual engineering jobs? I'm an EE with 7years experience and am stuck in my career, any advice would be appreciated.  **TLDR**: Are there jobs that involve challenging EE work instead of the bureaucratic nightmare that I'm currently trapped in? and how do I find them?  **Background**: I left my previous company after a year of doing near zero engineering work, in my new company I'm finding myself in the same situation.   **Experiences**: In my first job out of college I was writing firmware, designing 12-layer PCBs, troubleshooting at the component level, all my time was spent reading datasheets, it was great, but the pay was terrible and nowhere else to go within the company, so I moved on.  Since leaving that position, both companies I have been with since have had great pay, but the engineering work and internal bureaucracies are a joke.  Both job descriptions listed out the kinds of things I wanted to do, but I'm doing none of those.  From what I can see, any engineering work that does happen is completely hamstrung by mismanagement and internal bureaucracy.  I spend my time waiting for work and attending meetings where no one can determine an owner for otherwise very (VERY) simple problems that drag on for months.  I'm bored, not learning anything, and frustrated by the inefficiency.    **Example**: We need a very basic PDU to upgrade a station.  I spec'd out the PDU (real straight forward).  I'm now a dozen meetings and two months in and I'm still giving presentations on it, not about technical requirements (no one wants to hear those) but because I need to explain that there is an old PDU, and due to internal standards, we need a new one.  I did this at my previous job, and I'm doing it again at my current one, I'm losing my mind.  **Current Outlook**:  I realize that I'm new to the company, not going to get the fun projects right away, but I am in the meetings where they are discussed.  The work is spread out over a committee people who'd rather spend more time shrugging their shoulders than having any technical discussion.  Any mention of this to management has been met with enigmatic \"work is coming\" with no elaboration or plans to prepare for that work.  **Future plans**: I don't want to make a habit of jumping jobs, that's no good for a resume, but I can't deal with the boredom, and feeling my skills languish from lack of use is killing me.   How do I find a job with challenging technical problems and the agency to solve them?  I'm considering going back to school, but haven't determined if that will help.  I'm also considering a career change, probably to software, or frankly, literally anything else.

I've heard many interns complain about not getting to do any \"engineering\" work, but after discussing it with them further it turns out that if they weren't doing that task, the company would have a full time engineer doing it instead.", "rejected": "Don't forget to go to work.

This is the place to apply for a flair \u2013 the colored text you will have seen next to some user's names indicating their specialization. We are always looking for new flaired users, and if you think you have what it takes to join the panel of historians, you're in the right place!  For examples of previous applications, and our current panel of historians, you can find the previous application thread here, and there is a list of active flaired users](/r/AskHistorians/wiki/flairedusers) on our wiki.  **[Requirements for a flair**  A flair in /r/AskHistorians indicates extensive, in-depth knowledge about an area of history *and* a proven track record of providing great answers in the subreddit. In applying for a flair, you are claiming to have:  * **Expertise in an area of history**, typically from either degree-level academic experience or an equivalent amount of self-study. For more exploration of this, check out this thread.  * The ability to **cite sources** from specialist literature for any claims you make within your area.  * The ability to provide **high quality answers** in the subreddit in accordance with our rules.    For a more in-depth look at how applications are analyzed, consult this helpful guide on our wiki explaining what an answer that demonstrates the above looks like.  **How to apply**  To apply for a flair, simply post in this thread. Your post needs to include:  * Links to **3-5 comments** in /r/AskHistorians that show you meet the above requirements, and of which at least three were posted in the last six months. Answers linked in an application should go 'above and beyond' the base requirements of the rules here, and reflect the depth of your expertise.  * The **text of your flair** and which category it belongs in (see the sidebar). Be as specific as possible as we prefer flair to reflect the exact area of your expertise as near as possible, but be aware there is a limit of 64 characters.  One of the moderators will then either confirm your flair or, if the application doesn't adequately show you meet the requirements, explain what's missing. If you get rejected, don't despair! We're happy to give you advice and pointers on how to improve your portfolio for a future application. Plenty of panelists weren't approved the first time.  If there's a backlog this may take a few days but we will try to get around to everyone as quickly as possible.  **\"I'm an Expert About Something But Never Have a Chance to Write About It!\"**  Some topics only come up once in a blue moon, but that doesn't mean you can't still get flair in it! There are a number of avenues to follow, many of which are dealt with in greater detail at the last section of this thread.  **Expected Behavior**  We invest a large amount of trust in the flaired members of /r/askhistorians, as they represent the subreddit when answering questions, participating in AMAs, and even in their participation across reddit as a whole. As such, we do take into account an applicant's user history reddit-wide when reviewing an application, and will reject applicants whose post history demonstrate bigotry, racism, or sexism. Such behavior is not tolerated in /r/askhistorians, and we do not tolerate it from our panelists in any capacity. We additionally reserve the right to revoke flair based on evidence of such behavior after the application process has been completed. /r/AskHistorians is a safe space for everyone, and those attitudes have no place here.  **Quality Contributors**  If you see an unflaired user consistently giving excellent answers, they can be nominated for a \"Quality Contributor\" flair. Just message the mods their username and some example comments which you believe meet the above criteria.  **FAQ Finder**   To apply for FAQ finder, we require demonstration of a consistent history of community involvement and linking to previous responses and the FAQ. We expect to see potential FAQ Finders be discerning in what they link to, ensuring that it is to threads which represent the current standards of the subreddit, and they do so in a polite and courteous manner, both to the 'Asker', and also by including a username ping of the original 'Answerer'.  **Revoking Flair**  Having a flair brings with it a greater expectation to abide by the subreddit's rules and maintain the high standard of discussion we all like to see here. The mods will revoke the flair of anybody who continually breaks the rules, fails to meet the standard for answers in their area of expertise, or violates the above mentioned expectations. Happily, we almost never have to do this.  **Additional Resources**  Before applying for flair, we encourage you to check out these resources to help you with the application process:  * Our Rules Roundtable on 'Expertise' and the Flair Application Process * Our Wiki Guide on what makes a good application * The Previous Application Threads, to see what makes for successful - and not successful - applications.  * The Sunday Digest, and Monthly Awards which can provide many examples of we are looking for regarding the caliber of flaired users.", "preferred": "Hi AskHistorians, I would like to apply for a flair under the title of \"Modern Maghrib / French Colonialism and Imperialism,\" which for me would fit better under a mix of the categories of \"Middle East\" and \"Africa.\"  Here are my responses:  * Why did decolonization happen primarily after World War 2, instead of during the World Wars? * Where did the descendants of European colonists tend to go after colonies became independent countries during the 2nd half of the 20th century? * What was Vichy rule like in the French colonies, especially distant ones like Indochina?

{"prompt": "What is it like to leave academia? I get the sense that most of this sub is geared toward university PhD professors/post-docs/grad students so I am in a little bit of a different position but I think a lot of the same values, positives, and negatives of academia apply so I am looking for any thoughts from similarly  academically-minded people.  &#x200B;  I am currently finishing my medical residency (rough equivalent of post-doc). Like many of you, I have been in academia my whole life and been rewarded so far with opportunities, praise, respect, grants, etc. But I am at a career crossroads now that I have to get my first \"real\" job. The two jobs are probably more similar than they are different in the grand scheme of things given that my main role will be seeing patients either way. The main differences are the environment, autonomy, and pay.   &#x200B;  The two jobs:  \\--Academic job: 20-30% research time, 70% seeing patients, teaching, and administrative duties. Somewhat more flexible lifestyle due to culture and slower pace (45-50 hours/week). Pay starts at 300k/year and may rise slowly over the next 10-15 years. I am lukewarm about my research but could continue it. The main benefit is getting to stay in an intellectually engaging environment at a top institution for my field, and one where I am comfortable having been in the academic environment for almost 20 years.   \\--Private job: 100% seeing patients every day, can be a bit of a grind (55-60 hours/week). Pay starts higher (maybe 400-450k/year) and will rise quickly for 2 years to 600-800k/year, and then slowly rise after that as I get more efficient over time and/or with inflation.  Main benefit is the money, lack of having research projects hang over my head (and having to bring work home with me). Possible downsides are missing the intellectual side of academia and the longer-term outlook that comes with research (i.e. every day/week/month is going to be the same in broad strokes, I'll be doing the same thing in August 2030 as I am in August 2020).   &#x200B;  Has anyone on this sub left academia after years of being in academia and succeeding at it?

Batman worries that if he makes one exception, he will start making others, and others, until he is no better than the super villains he fights against.", "rejected": "Because he wants to.  It's discussed sometimes, he has some of the worst villains out there, they aren't dark gods, or horrors from beyond human knowledge, most of them are just people, monstrous, evil, yes, but just people, Batman could easily have snapped their necks like twigs on their first encounter.  He doesn't because he could, and despite everything, Batman believes in justice, the law, if he crosses that specific line, he isn't any better than them."}
{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old: How does gravity bend light if light is massless?", "preferred": "Push down in the center of your mattress.  Now roll a ball straight across the mattress.  Oh, you can\u2019t? The ball wobbles near the center where you\u2019re pushing down?  But why does it? After all, you\u2019re not touching the ball at all!  Same thing with gravity bending space. The light doesn\u2019t change direction - the space it\u2019s moving through is warped.", "rejected": "Gravity bends spacetime. Light moves through spacetime, so the light bends because the space it's traveling through bends.   This was predicted by Einstein and then confirmed by an eclipse."}
