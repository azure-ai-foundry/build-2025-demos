{"item": {"input": "CMV: There are many positives to organized religion, and from my point of view the online left fails to see the benefits of it. How\u2019s it going guys. I\u2019m writing this from a place of good faith, so I would hope you respond as such. I\u2019m not religious, but I\u2019m extremely sympathetic to many religious peoples and groups. I think they are a force for good in America, and in many parts of the world.   I have a few points, just a few.  A: Community Organizing and Involvement B: Charity and Donation C: Common Morality   A: This is my biggest point, and it basically boils down to the idea of a central community building or area which can be shared and used for the will of the people. This has numerous benefits to the people, because the face to face human interaction of people who may disagree over politics, law, and the world can help make the situation much more amicable and respectful. People become less separated from each other because there is always a time of the week where you come together, sing songs, talk about life, and unite around something that are all parts of your life. This space can also be used for things unrelated to the church, such as picnics and clubs.  B: Religious organization all across the world, and specifically in America are some of the biggest givers. They donate in large amounts, to lots of different causes and people groups, no matter the time or situation. These donation aren\u2019t always related to faith either, and can range from helping your local homeless shelter to giving aid to Syrian refugees. This has demonstrably helped many people all over the world, and religious organizations are vital to thousands of non profits all across the globe. This isn\u2019t much of a arguable point, since you\u2019d be hard pressed to find someone who hates charity.   C: This is probably the main point you may disagree with, but I think a common sense of moralities is important for a society to function. Obviously they would have to follow the laws, but having act better because of some eternal force combing us all together is , I think, a good thing.   Common arguments against this are absolutely the bad religion has done before and arguable does today.

{"item": {"input": "CMV: It is morally wrong to allow a baby to be born with a serious mental/physical birth defect, and the more morally right option is to abort it. For the summer, I am working at a sleep over camp that hosts different events per week. This week is what is known as \u201cbridge camp\u201d which means it\u2019s for children with special needs. The primary affliction here is Down Syndrome, however there are also kids with autism, major OCD, cerebral palsy, and a handful of others. After watching these kids for a few days, it is incredibly obvious to see that they suffer. We\u2019ve had an incident where some silverware was dropped in the kitchen, and a child with a sensitivity to sound started to panic because of it. It took nearly half an hour for him to calm down, and he had to be separated from the other campers so he wouldn\u2019t worry anyone else. We also have a lake, and the children are allowed to swim in it (under intense supervision of course). All was going well until a girl felt something brush up against her leg, panicked, and started to push her helper camper under water in fear, trying to get out of the water. If a few other helpers didn\u2019t jump into action quickly, I\u2019m sure that helper would have drowned, due to the size of the special needs girl compared to her. While I agree all life is important, what right do people have to decide that someone needs to live their entire life this way? Fear and panic are absolutely no way to live a life, especially for someone that doesn\u2019t understand the world around them. I think that making the decision to force a child to live with something so damning is wrong, and it would be better to simply abort the fetus early, if the condition is known about. Otherwise you\u2019re cursing your child to suffer all throughout their lives.", "output": "I also worked with mentally retarded children many, many years ago. I have the absolute opposite view from yours. All children panic and many adults have reacted out of blind fear and harmed others. People with Downs Syndrome are usually sweet, gentle, and loving people. They are capable of more cognition than you give them credit for. Though their lives are shorter, they appear to enjoy it. Their parents love them. They bring net happiness into the world, based on just my subjective opinion.  Similarly, if I found out tomorrow that my child had some horrible disease that would cause him to die after a year of suffering, I would still choose to bring him into the world. He is 100% the greatest source of personal happiness I have ever experienced. I am appalled by the idea of terminating him and disallowing him from experiencing the joy he has had so far.   Feelings like this complicate my pro-life stance too, in case you were wondering about moral consistency. I don't believe in abortion for myself personally, so I have taken extraordinary measures throughout my life to prevent accidental conception. I think every life is worth living EXCEPT in the rare case of a person who is (pretty objectively) a net source of evil in the world, which is a pretty small category including people like Ted Bundy and Adolf Hitler."}}

To me, it's \"normal sweet\", most of the time, but it seems that for most people from the UK or AU (where else?) are disgusted by this level of sweetness. So I am wondering why this is the case. Are desserts in these other countries not normally this sweet?   When I think of dessert, it's something that *should* be very sweet, but also eaten in small amounts, and enjoyed in moderation. Certainly not something you eat every day. So I also wonder if desserts are typically eaten more often in these other countries? Is it an everyday thing? Do you eat larger portions?

Desserts and treats I had originally loved in the US were now WAY too sweet for me, and I no longer enjoy them.   Someone commented that US desserts seem to rank sweetness/sugar above flavor, and I think that's spot on. I now reduce the sugar in most American recipes I make (for flavor rather than health reasons) and almost everyone who eats my stuff comments that they love how it's not as sweet as other desserts. I rely on ingredients like very good quality chocolate, quality vanilla, etc. to get flavor rather than adding sugar just to get sweetness.

{"item": {"input": "CMV: Banning people from social media for bigotry and misinformation only serves to exacerbate the echo chamber problem. Rules against hate speech on social media have mainly had the effect of distilling racists and conspiracy theorists onto alternative social media sites, like Gab, Ruqqus, and Parler. These smaller and more homogenous echo chambers make their subculture exponentially more radicalized and alienated. If you somehow go after those sites, they'll just wind up on the darkweb.  You shouldn't want them banned unless you think the recruitment problem outweighs the echo chamber problem. Are you more afraid of how many racists there currently are and their ability to further radicalized each other, or are you more concerned with how many more racists there could be?", "output": "Banning people does continually reduces the membership to the echo chamber though. So let's say there are 1,000,000 racist of various degrees (eg. ignorant racists, brought up wrong racists, susceptible racists, tagalong racists, lazy racists etc). 10,000 are hardcore \"kill the other race if they can get away\" racists. Today the 10,000 puts time and effort and spreads the message through free and easily available social media. Left to their own devices, they convert more and more of the remaining 990,000 to get closer to their hardcore spectrum of racism.  As you put more and more barriers up, it gets harder and harder for the 10,000 to convert the remaining 990,000 because it gets more expensive and takes more effort for the rest of the 990,000 to receive the message. First the lazy racist goes, followed by the tagalong racist and the susceptible racist and so forth. This doesn't change the 10,000 hardcore trapped in their own little echo chamber, but it does make membershp and access to the echo chamber harder.  Just like there are continual forces making a person more racists, there are other forces making a person less racist. Racists don't have monolithic degrees of racism. Some are brought up in household of racists, then they go out to the world and interact with people of other race and realise the incorrectness of their beliefs. Others just need the constant barrage of racisit rhethoric to cease so they can start hearing different views and perspectives.  And here's the final kicker of my argument. This used to work. Post WW2, Germany went through an Allied Power driven denazisation effort. Did Nazist / Neo Nazist disappeared completely? of course not but they were driven underground. Today you have Neo Nazis in Germany, but also strong hate speech legislation hamstring them. Such legislation are supported by most of the German population. The resurgence of Neo Nazism occured when the denazisation efforts was loosen.  The Internet age created seemless easy way to circumvent efforts to control them. Social media accelerated this even more. Why not reverse this trend, we already know the effect of social media in spreading hate and misinformation, why not try reversing it as opposed to burdened by a vague sense of fairness?  Your CMV is ultimately proposing a hypothesis of what will happen, respectfully I'm providing you a historical experience that counters your hypothesis."}}

But they are asking because they are in nobody's coverage area, so what company puts them down as a no when none applies, who do you blame for not expanding? That metric doesn't work either.  The problem is the only concrete stuff you can do is tell them where to spend it, if that's on \u201dinstalling fiber\" then that's what they'll spend it on. But ISPs are constantly installing fiber, in fact that may be spending billions a year just to replace existing fiber, if you tell them you'll pay for it they'll just stop paying for installing fiber and let you pay, the money saved can be given out to shareholders. That of course is equivalent to just giving the money away, but there wasn't anything that said they can't\u200b do that.  So really it's a very hard problem to define, there can be some requirements on it, but they can't be tough, and that makes it just about equal to giving it away.

The first applies to this conversation, the second does not.   Territorial Citizens are fully American citizens on Incorporated soil, but their own communities are not places in which they are fully eligible for federal representation.   The biggest difference in rights however, is between Americans convicted of felonies and Americans who have not been. The definition of a felony is vague in America and many misdemeanors are felonies...based upon the whims of the judge and former records (Jim Crow policies) - but effectively, these crimes, however they are defined in ones state, locality, or federally will leave an American struggling to get a job, unable to vote, often for the rest of their lives, unable to own a firearm (not here to discuss whether our 2nd Amendment Liberties fit in our modern society so would prefer if we kept that discussion to a minimal) and depending on the judge/state, various other requirements, like regular monitoring during \"probation,\" which is effectively a game of catch and release.   My stance is that limiting the rights and opportunities of people with felonies after their sentence (including probation) has been completed is immoral, arguably, tyrannical, and a relic of our enslavement culture, so we should reenfranchise, return gun rights to, and cease deportations of former citizens and limiting jobs available to convicted felons unless credible basis for a persistent threat to our election systems, the safety of others, or other institutions can be established (affiliation with a terrorist or international criminal organization, election meddling, etc...)   If anyone disagrees with this, please, let me know why and let's have a discussion.", "output": "I agree voting rights shouldn't be restricted.... But if someone embezzled millions of dollars or shot a bunch of people or raped a child , I think there's plenty of reason to restrict some of their freedoms in the future.

{"item": {"input": "What is with everyone reducing sugar in recipes by HUGE amounts? Is this a regional difference in preference? This is a serious question, I am not trying to shame anyone here.   I live in the US, and apparently our desserts here are notorious for being very sweet, or even overly sweet. To me, it's \"normal sweet\", most of the time, but it seems that for most people from the UK or AU (where else?) are disgusted by this level of sweetness. So I am wondering why this is the case. Are desserts in these other countries not normally this sweet?   When I think of dessert, it's something that *should* be very sweet, but also eaten in small amounts, and enjoyed in moderation. Certainly not something you eat every day. So I also wonder if desserts are typically eaten more often in these other countries? Is it an everyday thing? Do you eat larger portions?  I'm really curious to hear from people that have experience with both US-based desserts, and UK-based desserts.

But here goes: My dad is insane and I think me and my family may be in danger and we\u2019re not sure what our options are. So a brief rundown: the past 8 years my dad has had random spikes of psychotic behavior and it\u2019s gotten worse and worse over time. This year, and specifically the past few months, it has gotten worse exponentially. I\u2019m pretty sure he has an extreme case of paranoid schizophrenia and possibly other debilitations. There have been several times that police have come to our house because of calls related to his behavior, but without evidence for an obvious crime, there\u2019s never really been much success there. Especially since he seems to be able to flip off his craziness like a switch when police show up\u2014 then we end up looking like we made the whole thing up.   A little more background, his father fought in Vietnam and had exposure to Agent Orange (suspected, I don\u2019t know the specific details) and ended up becoming very violent and disconnected later in life. My father\u2019s oldest brother has also been diagnosed with schizophrenia and is currently in the state hospital for murdering their mother (my grandmother). My father\u2019s second oldest brother is currently in prison for attempted murder, which he had tried to convince my father to help him with. To put it bluntly: there is a family history of psychopathic tendencies and murder on my dad\u2019s side.  Lately, my father has been getting increasingly crazier. He says he sees spirits jumping in and out of animals and people, he calls it a gift from god. He\u2019s also been watching a lot of murder documentaries and has been making weird comments about murdering people. He told my mother that he needed to kill this guy he suspected of stalking my mother, or \u201cat least cut his legs off\u201d so he can\u2019t stalk her anymore. And then the other day he told my mother that the shows he\u2019s watching are making him want to attempt murder. Specifically, he said he\u2019s been wanting to \u201ctake a hammer and bash someone\u2019s head in\u201d.   At this point, we don\u2019t know what our options are but I fear we\u2019re in a lot of danger.

{"item": {"input": "CMV: Dating and finding a relationship is easier for the average woman compared to the average man Now, this isn't a post to bash women or how dating is easy for women. It's about how when you compare the experience of the average woman compared to the average man, it's easier for the woman to find dates and a relationship.  Let's start with an example from my personal life. Last year some friend of mine broke up. So far the woman has gone on multiple dates with three different dudes one after the other. Essentially when she decides that she doesn't like one guy she just moves on to the next one in less than a week. While my male friend hasn't had a single date so far and that's not due to a lack of trying. Now even though at the end of the day they are both still single, the women at least go on dates which mean she has a higher chance to find someone compared to the man who hasn't been on a single date.  This brings me to my first point. The average woman has a lot more options compared to the average man. I remember reading a survey that said that on average women are asked about 12 times a year compared to asking less than 1 guy out. And when we introduce online dating it gets even worse. On average a woman has a match rate of 30% while a man has 0.013%. This means that statistically, women have a lot more opportunities to meet the one compared to a man. More options are better than fewer options.  My second point comes down to the average dating strategy. The average woman is a lot more passive than a man, in the man is still the one doing the asking out and trying to impress the woman. This means that women have the option to just passively exist and they just pick and choose from their options. In addition to that, they always have the option of becoming proactive and going after the guys they want if they don't like their options. Compared that to the average guy whose only option is to actively go out looking for women and initiating stuff, since if he just stayed and waited for women to approach he will remain single.  And finally, there is the problem that till about the age of 54 there are just more men than women.", "output": "I would disagree based on the following thought.    The average women in the dating pool is now a millennial. However this would also apply to genx or genz   The majority of millennial women attend college and therefore prefer a mate who is also a college student/graduate.    Women outnumber men in college 60/40 (and have since like the 1970s), therefore men with a college degree will always be relatively scarce in the dating pool making finding a suitable mate more difficult for the average women.    This actually gets worse as they age. It's 60/40 (1.5:1) in college but as college educated women marry college educated men the ratio will fall to 40/20 (2:1), then to 30/10 (3:1), then to 25/5 (5:1).    This is obviously based on the underlying assumption that women want a mate of at least equal education, but these preferences are supported by evidence.

Some even actively encouraged me to take it off my resume because it meant you had some book knowledge and no active workforce training.  Just across the river in Vancouver WA the community college has an amazing culinary program that teaches all sorts of modern applicable cooking/baking skills that I wish my school had taught instead of just rolling a million baguettes for a month straight.   The only person I know who benefitted from official culinary school was a girl who went right after high school and was still living at home, she didn't have to worry about bills or anything and could focus on work and getting a part time job at a bakery for experience. She then was able to run her own small business pretty much right after school because her aunt and uncle owned a restaurant that they let her bake out of (presumably for cheap or free). Her decorated cakes/cookies aren't that pretty but she's got a majorly helpful support system that she's utilized to her advantage.

{"item": {"input": "CMV: The Argument for Student Debt Cancellation is Ridiculous and Flawed I want to make an initial disclaimer that I absolutely agree that college is way too expensive in the US currently and something needs to be done about it, however I feel that proponents of student debt cancellation consistently put forward arguments that are unrealistic, hypocritical, and brazenly self-interested, while masquerading as public interest. I want to discuss a few of them.  &#x200B;  **1.** **It is unfair and predatory to target high school students with these loans when they don't know what they are getting into.**  I somewhat agree, but I also think the simplicity of this argument ignores some realities. The people that sign these student loans are legally adults, and should be held accountable for that. I get that they are facing societal pressures of people telling them to go to college, but as legal adults it is their responsibility to know what they are getting into. I would support increased education for high school students about loans and debt, but absolving an entire demographic segment from responsibility for their debt on the basis that \"they couldn't have known\" is frankly ridiculous and feels like a cop-out.; 18 year olds are legally able to join the military or buy a home. If we want to absolve 18 year olds of their student loan debt, we would need to have a much bigger conversation about whether 18 year olds can legally be considered adults at all.  &#x200B;  **2. Student loans should be dischargeable through bankruptcy**  Sounds good in theory, but this ignores a fundamental principle of how bankruptcy works. If a business declares bankruptcy or if you can't make payments on your house or car, the bank can seize the business's assets or your house or the car. But if you can't make student loan payments, the bank can't exactly seize your degree or education.  &#x200B;  **3. We should cancel student debt because it would spur economic activity**  I'm not sure whether more consumer spending is even what we need right now in the high-inflationary economic environment in the US, but in any case, the argument has been present in so many political debates in recent political history, where one side asks to be given more money/spending power with the assurance that this economic activity will translate to the rest of the population in some way (Trickle Down Economics anyone?). It has always sounded to me like pro-cancellation arguers are just asking to be given more spending power, while hiding behind an argument that it's actually for the public good. Furthermore, I feel that undermining the principle of how debt works in our society by outright cancelling such a large amount of it would have enormous economic consequences and this would would outweigh any potential economic benefit (i.e. the debt can only be cancelled if the US government agrees to assume all of it, which would be incredibly expensive, or if they just order it to be written off, in which case no lender would ever have faith in the future that they can lend money and be assured of getting it back; at the end of the day, someone has to pay). If the Fed or the government really wants to spur economic activity, they can do so through targeted economic policy like stimulus packages or interest rates that wouldn't be nearly as haphazard or dangerous.   &#x200B;  **4. People who have paid off their student loans that are critical of student debt cancellation for others are wrong**  I have seen this one a lot. People who have paid off their own loans are critical of student debt cancellation (IMO justifiably so),because they feel that they worked hard and sacrificed to pay off their loans and are now being penalized by missing out on a hypothetical debt cancellation bonus. The counter-argument often offered is that these people are being selfish and that this is the price of progress, and we can't just not take progressive action simply because some people may miss out. An example that I have actually seen put forward on Reddit is that: if we hypothetically invent a cure for cancer, we can't just not use the treatment on current cancer patients, even if people who have already died of cancer may have missed out on this new treatment; we have to strive to progress as a society and cannot cater to the \"bag-holders\" who may have missed the wagon. This doesn't make sense to me, and again seems incredibly self-interested. A more applicable analogy to the cancer example would be if tomorrow we cap annual tuition for college at $5k for all future generations and leave all current student debt holders as the proverbial bag-holders; doing this would immeasurably benefit future generations in a sustainable fashion and allow equitable access to education, but current student debt holders would be the ones stuck paying the \"price of progress\".   &#x200B;  My personal stance on this issue has always been that we should lower interest rates so that people can actually pay off the debt, and focus our valuable political capital on policy action that tries to regulate or lower college tuition costs and expand access to college through these lowered costs, rather than cancelling student debt, which to me feels like a Band-Aid post-factum solution that doesn't address the root cause. I would love to hear what everyone else thinks!", "output": ">I somewhat agree, but I also think the simplicity of this argument ignores some realities.

If we want to absolve 18 year olds of their student loan debt, we would need to have a much bigger conversation about whether 18 year olds can legally be considered adults at all.  You don't even trust them to drink beer. The reason quoted for that is usually that their brains are still developing. How can you expect them to make life altering decisions if you don't even trust them to drink beer for that reason? Very obviously they are *not* fully considered as adults. There's definitely a case of \"some of us are more equal than the rest\" case going on, and it's entirely arbitrary.   >A more applicable analogy to the cancer example would be if tomorrow we cap annual tuition for college at $5k for all future generations and leave all current student debt holders as the proverbial bag-holders;  No, this is just moving the goalposts."}}

{"item": {"input": "Engineering Managers - how do I get a raise? You are my Engineering Manager. I'm a mid-level engineer. Last year's performance was great and I was given a 3% raise, which is basically nothing and even losing money, taking inflation into account.  My question is: How do I approach this? Rampant inflation is not a valid reason to bring up, isn't it? Do I create a mini presentation of completed projects and total revenue I made for the company? Or do you just care about margin? What else do I put together to make the best case for a raise?  Thank you.", "output": "Engineering Managers have zero power to get you a raise, other than recommending it. They're just as salty about their own 2-3% \"raise\" as you are about yours.  One of two things has likely occurred:  * The CFO/President/CEO said \"1-3% for everyone based on merit\" and that's that. * The engineering director/VP was given a bag of peanuts in funds (by the CFO/President/CEO) to distribute as they saw fit for raises that year. Which either meant screwing over half the team so the top performers could get 4-5%, or everyone gets the 2-3%.  By all means bring it up to your manager if you have a good working relationship, but don't expect anything to come out of it. Raises no longer exist in the modern corporate world. If you want more than 1-3%, you have to find a new job."}}

All but one were in academia. Below are narratives of how the ones that worked out came to be.  I received one interview that stayed an interview, four offers, and two invitations to apply. I started sending applications in the beginning of March last year, and received my first interest at the end of that month. I accepted my offer in August. Of the 60 cold emails, I only had about 10 responses. The ones that weren't immediately \"no/no funding\" are below.  My interview happened at the end of the month. A collaborator who didn't do what we did was curious after I emailed him, and we talked. He didn't have any positions, but seemed pleased I thought of him and we parted, promising to keep in contact as things evolved.  First invitation to apply: International facility, well known in my field, with a yearly competitive program for international hires. Did not advance past second round.   First offer: In response to an industry email, I was curious and submitted my resume. First was a phone interview, then Skype, then I flew to their research facility and had a long day of meeting folks. I absolutely loved the location and the folks I met around town. I decided that the work wouldn't make me happy, and declined after a week of consideration, despite the location. This was possible because...  Second offer: A nearby (8 hour drive) R1 University with two groups interested in me both had interest. I knew one group through competition and one of their postdocs visited our lab a few months prior. The other had a postdoc reach out to me at a national conference after a talk I gave. I had phone calls with them and visited both groups over a 3 day weekend. After receiving their offer, I declined the industry job, because I knew I had a better fit for me. This job was more engineering and less experimental than I liked, though, so a couple weeks later I declined after ...  Third offer: The one I ended up taking. An R1 across the country. The PI of this group is **very** well known, and has a nearly fifty year career. He visited my grad PI's group, and I asked if he had a postdoc available, and he said he had two. So I applied. This group is much more in line with my long term career objectives. As a bonus, it was near the industry job location. Of the job offers I received, it paid by far the least on a cost-of-living perspective, but it was still enough, because it gets me where I want and wasn't \"paying for my happiness.\" I held off on committing for three weeks after interviewing in person, because...  Fourth offer: A national lab job. An alumnus of the department came back and gave a talk on opportunities at that lab. I looked around and found an open tangentially-related position, emailed the guy, and had a phone interview. While I wasn't a great fit for him, he knew a guy who was always looking, and sent my resume over. After another round of interviews with the other guy and his team, I flew out and interviewed in person. This job was really appealing to me for a lot of reasons, and I really agonized over my decision to not take it. I am thrilled I chose the third offer, but I wish I could have taken both.  Second invitation: After I had accepted the third job, over four months after sending an email, I heard back from another international facility that I was invited to apply with a proposal for research.

{"item": {"input": "How to help a friend struggling to swim in the deep end of academia? Buckle up, this requires a lot of background. My friend Hanna is in her mid-thirties. We met in graduate engineering school, were TAs for the same class and became close friends over time. I am not and have never really been in academia - got my MS and peaced out to industry. I'm struggling to understand how to help her because of my lack of knowledge.  She seems to become unhappier the more she sticks around academia, but is determined to stay in academia. Her dad was a professor and she loves teaching - whenever she used to come back from office hours, her eyes would just light up with joy. She'd always get the best, most ridiculous ratings on our TA reviews by the students.  She took about 6 years to finish her engineering PhD at a top university. Her advisor seemed a bit strange (rambled a lot, was disorganized, took three years to even read her second paper). If that person was my boss, I would have moved jobs because it seemed stressful and there was a lot of agonizing over things maybe not in her control? She had a fair number of papers when she graduated (3 with 1 more in process). She never seemed super happy writing papers and did not bug her professor as much as I would have for not reading her 1 paper.  She got a post-doc at another very good university. 6 months in and she was unhappy again. Similar to her first professor, this advisor seemed to ramble a lot, work odd hours. At least she got another paper published? But she would call being very stressed or unhappy about how things were running so I suggested maybe this post-doc wasn't the right fit. There was no teaching associated with this role.  She got another post-doc, this time at a top university. She gave the other professor 5 months notice that she was leaving. She was promised the ability to work on the research she wanted to work on. The new professor seemed very nice and from what she described, seemed to have more structure than the last two.   Well, it's been almost a year, and she is still very unhappy. I visited recently - and it just happened that her lab was going out to lunch so I joined - and the professor (her advisor) seems more chill (but still very rambly) but very oddly unprofessional? The professor spent most of lunch talking more than everyone else, and complaining to the lab manager about a small part of his job.  Hanna did not get what she promised from her advisor - she has not gotten to work on any of the projects she wanted to. That said, I know Hanna. She dislikes writing grants and I think might let opportunities like that slide by (or she certainly doesn't search them out). I also know that she's not super forceful in trying to communicate what she wants to work on, and she hasn't made specific plans to get there. I wish I could she say she was happy going with the flow - but she is specifically unhappy jumping on every odd task the advisor asks her to do. And there's no teaching.  And she will not quit. She's told me she's not sleeping well, and while she sat at her at-home desk when I visited for 8 hours, at least 2.5 of those hours were spent surfing the web or looking at youtube. She has mentioned being depressed (we don't really talk about specifics) but I know she's in therapy once a week.  She took one of these figure-out-what-you-want career paths with my and other friends' encouragement, and I desperately hoped this was it, she'd figure out that academia is making her unhappy and decide to do something else (probably teach?). Instead, she decided working at a smaller university with less research and more teaching is what she wanted to do.  I really want to support her. I've put together lists of universities she can look at, have offered to help review her research and teaching statements, and have tried nudging her to come up with a timeline for completing materials. She hasn't done the timeline thing. She never does. She has done some informational interviews, which I think is good. I've tried to encourage her to do some of these outside of academia - she's done a few, but frustratingly just with previous lab mates.  She also doesn't network. In my industry, that's just about the most important thing you can do. She is very introverted, and covid definitely hasn't helped get her going to events and just meeting other people in academia. I've tried to push her to do this, but she doesn't budge.  I've been very critical of Hanna here, but she is brilliant (like was valedictorian of undergrad and got almost perfect 4.0 in grad school), very caring and thoughtful, and I think is an amazing teacher. She is not the most organized and for some reason will not put things on a calendar to go do. She does not like writing grants, is on the fence about papers, and enjoys talking to the people she is close to and that's about it. Judging from all of her advisors who I could not stomach working for, I don't think she's great at judging character.  She seems more unhappy now than she has in a while (probably about as unhappy as she was when she changed post-docs). She thinks she needs to stay in her current post-doc another year while she applies to positions at small universities. I'm really worried about her - I know a job you despise can make your life miserable and lead to depression. She may already be there. I want to help her.  -Should I push her to leave academia? -Should I continue to push her to get on top of the small university applications? -Does she really need to stay at this post-doc another year if she wants to pursue an faculty position? -Would it really be the end of her academic career if she took an industry job for the next year? -What should I be doing to support her? -What advice do you have for her that I should pass along?", "output": "> She has mentioned being depressed (we don't really talk about specifics) but I know she's in therapy once a week.  Your well intended interventions may be undermining the work she's doing with her therapist. Make it clear what kind of professional and personal support you have to offer ***if she asks*** and then take a step back and, as others have suggested, be her friend.  If there is a moment where she seems especially down, be exceptionally careful with what you say. If you are able, you could express empathy and maybe say something that will prompt her to remember what her therapist may have said about similar situations. To be clear, what the therapist is not your business. If you are a good friend, you are interested only if Hannah wants to share the information. The task for you is to remind Hannah to remind herself.  If Hannah were here, I would suggest directly (and not through a third party) that she keep doing the work with her therapist. If the rapport isn't where she'd like it to be, she could/should say so in a session and center some of the work around improving trust. If it becomes evident that rapport isn't going to improve, it may be appropriate to find another person to work with."}}

I think having some close people to be open to is great if you have that (unfortunately I don't have a great support network, beyond my boyfriend and dog), but I know I never could have done it alone and without professional help and support.   I was also on the start of a slippery slope with alcohol, but it got banned during our first pandemic lockdown so I decided to not stock up, and have barely touched it since. How much I relied on it scared me but I know I wouldn't have been able to tone it down by myself (without the lockdown alcohol ban).

{"item": {"input": "Possibly overdosed on a MAOI. Having amphetamine-like effects 24/7 now + severe tachycardia&hypertension when eating chocolate - what should I do? **TL;DR:** A study said ethanolic Garlic Extract is a MAOI, I started eating 6-7 cloves of garlic daily for this effect (today is day 8). On days 3 and 5 I ate chocolate, and both times my heart rate shot up to ~130 BPM and blood pressure to ~150/85. Past few days, I've been feeling a 24/7 amphetamine-like drug high - focus, irritability, heart palpitations, high resting heart rate (85-90 BPM). Last time I ate Garlic was 24 hours ago, yet I still experience these symptoms. I fear that the MAOIs in garlic are irreversible - if so, could it possibly take 2-3 weeks for my symptoms to resolve (until new MAO enzymes are made)? What is the appropriate treatment until symptoms resolve? (Been taking Oxazepam after the chocolate-tachycardia, but can't take it daily because of withdrawal concerns).  ****  Age: 24  Sex: Male  I have been reading a study saying garlic has antidepressant effects in rats, and that it works by MAO inhibition, with comparable potency to the clinical MAOI Imipramine. Because of this, I proceeded to eat 6-7 cloves of raw garlic daily for 1 week, for the antidepressant effects.  I did feel stimulant-like, mild-antidepressant effects already on the first day, so I kept eating such amounts of garlic for a week. However, on Day 3, I had an incident where I ate chocolate, and got a mild version of \"hypertensive crisis\" - my heart rate shot up to 134 BPM, my blood pressure to 148/86 (my usual: 100/60). I immediately took 20mg oral Oxazepam and my vitals normalized. I didn't link it to the garlic, and so on Day 5, I ate chocolate and the same thing happened again, and Oxazepam helped me again.   Today I finally made the connection. The last time I ate garlic was 24 hours ago. Looking back, I realize that in the past few days, I've had pronounced amphetamine-like effects that lasted the entire day, every day, for at least 3-4 days. Focus, irritability, heart palpitations/\"flutters\", high resting heart rate - most of the effects. I took Adderall in the past, and I currently feel very similar to how the Adderall made me feel.  This makes me very concerned. My high resting heart rate (85-90 BPM) gives me a lot of discomfort, and the palpitations are worrying. Since I know many MAOIs can be irreversible, my biggest fear is that the MAOIs in garlic are also irreversible. In this case, does it mean it will take a few weeks for my symptoms to resolve? If so, what would be the treatment during those few weeks? I obviously cannot keep taking a benzodiazepine every time my heart rate spikes up, because then I'll develop withdrawals.

{"item": {"input": "First Year PhD Student Increasingly Disillusioned This is a throwaway account and I will try to skirt around any information that would identify me. I am in the US. I apologize for the length of this post but I am at my wits' end.  ___  I went to a very prestigious high school and, due to financial reasons, had to lower my gaze from the elite universities that most of my classmates ended up attending. I went to a pretty good public university on a full scholarship and did my best to never look back. I started as a CS major due to interest in high school. I got a research position in my second year (which I held for the rest of my undergraduate career), but found myself increasingly pulled towards mathematics and theoretical CS over the more application-oriented curriculum.   After some deliberation, I moved over to majoring in physics. (Actually, I felt I was so deep into the CS major that I might as well finish the degree, so I double majored.) For many reasons, I enjoyed the subject much more, but I was behind my classmates and my grades ended up \"suffering\" (A-s and some B+s, low in my eyes) for it. I caught up fast enough to have a good GPA in upper-level courses, but I did not have any room to explore graduate courses or electives due to my double major. I ended up finishing in ten semesters, which required taking multiple summer courses and a few semesters with course loads that made my advisors sigh. I had room for exactly only one elective (analysis) and one graduate physics course (QM).   I very often felt insecure about my non-extraordinary setting. I really want to say that the school doesn't matter, and that a committed student can be great anywhere, but the world has seemed to disagree with me on every single occasion. To try to keep a level ground, I periodically messaged friends studying physics at Ivies so that I could self-study material at a more sophisticated level. I have also worked through a general undergraduate math curriculum as I lean heavily towards mathematical physics. As of now I am still self-studying math, currently algebraic topology (Hatcher), next functional analysis (Conway).   My Physics GRE was something like 75%th percentile, which disappointed me greatly. I kept my head up and did not hold myself back when applying for PhDs. I did extensive research and applied only to schools I felt strongly towards, one of which was my undergraduate university. One of my advisors mentioned a very competitive scholarship for a full-ride to a English university, so I also applied for the Master's-equivalent there. That was my giant reach, and I was optimistic that my hard work would translate better through my essays than through my grades and raw data.   I was eating lunch with my friend when I saw the email that I wasn't chosen for the scholarship (after getting to the final round). I made a stupid excuse to him and went to the lab room where I put my head down and cried until I fell asleep. The truly awful part was a line in the email saying (paraphrased) \"Everyone who got to this stage is such a good candidate, this is probably the first time you've been turned down from something like this,\" after spending five years battling uphill so hard.   In the end my choice was between a PhD at my undergraduate institution, and admission the English school with no financial assistance. Because of COVID (and money, like always), I went with the PhD. I am in my first semester and the feelings of inadequacy get worse every week. I am still trying as hard as I can, but I feel like I am at an insurmountable disadvantage in my position and that a career in academia is completely doomed. Conversations like this recent one in r/math (which I frequent) constantly reinforce the idea that I am on a sinking ship. I love teaching and I love researching; a professorship is an absolute dream job for me. However, the ratio of applicants to job openings is not in my favor, and I am nowhere near the top of the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 pile.

Play devil's advocate sometime and engage against the people with the same viewpoints as yourself and you'll find the same thing.  A decent argument for being against trans women in women's sports is that the goal of fair competition is to remove any potential variables that may effect the outcome. Most sports have replay systems to lower or eliminate the variables of referees effecting the outcome of the game. Trans athletes have a variable. A set of balls. And those balls produce testosterone, which increases bone density, enlarge hearts, and increase lung capacity. How that translates to athletic performance is irrelevant. It's a variable."}}

I don't feel the FCC should censor or fine shows/channels or radio personalities for their content.  etween 1990 and 2004, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued fines totalling $2.5 million to radio licensees for airing material it deemed indecent from The Howard Stern Show, the highest amount of any American radio show.  As a result, Stern took his talents to Sirius Satellite Radio.

Often times I here people say they hate cats but I've never heard really any good reason to hate cats. The only one I can really understand is that they're allergic. But other than that, cats are pretty easy to maintain and take care of especially compared to dogs. Whenever someone says they hate cats they always use vague terms like, \"cats are evil\", or \"cats are just mean\". I think what people don't understand is that cats don't love unconditionally like dogs do. From my experience if you treat a cat with love and take care of it as you should cats can be the most love able creatures on the planet. With dogs however, you could literally be abusive to a dog as long as you feed it it'll still obey your command.  That's why I think majority of people say they hate cats. Because cats aren't going to blindly follow all your commands like a dog would so therefore they aren't as programmable as dogs if that makes sense. Each cat has its own unique personality and what it likes.  Cats also don't attack people like dogs do cats for the most part just mind their own business and don't require much attention. Cats are much more hygienic than dogs, cats don't bark all the time and disturb people, cats overall don't really bother anyone. So why do so many people claim they \"hate\" cats when cats have never done anything bad to them?

He scratched the absolute hell out of my mom one time.

We didn't have health insurance so my mom was used to toughing anything strange out. After a few days I noticed this red line was getting longer and following my mom's vein. I had a long conversation with her and got her to go to the hospital. She had to be admitted and was in the hospital for like 3-5 nights with a blood infection.    They told her she would have died within a few days if she hadn't gone to the hospital.  Like I said we love cats and both have cats but I definitely understand people who don't.

It would just attack anyone it didn't know. Full on attack to kill kind of attack.  Maybe we shouldn't name cats human names is the moral but some cats can be crazy. Just like some dogs can be.

I'm just not that into the activities that are popular here (i.e., sports, church, and the outdoors).  There aren't even activities I would enjoy doing alone here.

That meant going to education fairs and see what offers existed, at one point I thought of joining the army but I was too old for it(27). I did a professional course related with construction, but that was, I wouldn't say a waste of time, but shouldn't have done it. I also did a course in occupational health and safety, it was good to know that I didn't want to be a paper pusher.   I always liked engineering, but never thought I was smart enough for it. I had decent math skills but never had studied physics. I applied to study at uni close to where I lived and got admitted, classes were at night and after starting a month and a half late I had a lot of catching up to do. Classes were from 6pm to 11pm plus Saturdays 8 am to 2pm. I met other people in a situation similar to mine and made a few good friends.

{"item": {"input": "Why haven't modern-day Socrateses, or even Epictetuses emerged from academic philosophy to shake up the world? Why do Academic philosophers seem to operate in hermetic communities and discuss topics with little or not application to practical life? Why aren't they making an impact?", "output": "There is actually a good analysis to be done here, but unfortunately no one ever bothers to think about it every time this question is asked. My short answer would be something like: particular incentives and historical trends since roughly WW1 have resulted in many Anglosphere academic philosophers (the situation is different in say, France) largely trying to avoid involvement with anything considered political or mainstream. This includes everything from:  - Nietzsche's disdain for politics, the misuse of his work during WW1 and WW2, his \"rehabilitation\" after WW2 as more of an individualist and less of a political thinker, and the subsequent influence he had on other thinkers  - Analytic philosophy's general avoidance of politics and preference for language, logic, and other \"apolitical\" topics  - The increasing dominance of the media/YouTube/social media on political discussions and lessening influence of traditional academics and thinkers.   The short answer is, if an academically-trained philosopher *wanted* to be the Socrates of 2022, he would probably end up as someone similar to Jordan Peterson (oversimplifying topics and getting cozy with the media), \u017di\u017eek (a bit clownish and repetitive to get attention) or Peter Singer (known largely for a single issue and not for being a \"philosopher\" writ large.) I'd also add that Stoicism seems to be doing fairly well in the mainstream and guys like Massimo Pigliucci are reasonably well-known."}}
{"item": {"input": "CMV: Ceaselessly Hate-Sharing the Posts of Our Political Enemies Does More Harm Than Good I'm from the US and personally lean pretty far to the left, so my Reddit feed includes several left-leaning subs, and some days it feels as though my feed is dominated by reposts of tweets from Ben Shapiro, Matt Walsh, Stephen Crowder, Charlie Kirk, Marjorie Taylor-Greene, Lauren Boebert, etc. I like to laugh and gape at the dumb things they say as much as anyone, but at a certain point it feels like the sheer amount of signal boosting we do of extremist and troll voices does more hard than good.  First, I want to acknowledge the one positive that occurs to me (there maybe be others) -   1) **It gives us a window into the opposition's thinking.** However stupid these beliefs may seem to me, they're held by millions. And while some of these people are just troolish pundits - Crowder, Kirk, Walsh, etc - others are actual members of the US's national governing body. So however much I might cringe at what they're saying, it might also be important for me to hear it so I know what I'm up against.  But I personally just feel that the downsides are stronger -   1) **It feeds the troll.** These people go out of their way to post the most incendiary possible version of their beliefs specifically to garner attention, both good and bad. They want to rile up their base, but also to rile us up. All press is good press if you're a scumbag, and they seem to take pleasure in our frustration/horror/mockery. And even if we're just reposting a tweet, inevitably that's going to lead more people to the original tweet.   2) **It makes us believe that everyone on their side agrees with them.** In the same way that delving into abortion statistics reveals that the conservative (and liberal) rank and file have far more nuanced views than their most extremist flank, I find that talking to just about any conservative is more complex (and genuine) then the gotcha jabs and distorted statistics and extremist takes that people like Greene and Shapiro post. Yes, plenty of people agree with these crazies, but plenty don't.   3) **It makes us dumber.** Some of our beliefs might really benefit from some scrutiny. Some of our positions might be opposed by real evidence or persuasive rhetoric that's worth hearing out. But we'll never believe that as long as we mostly share and engage with the stupidest voices on the opposing side. I don't believe in a false equivalence, or endless devil's advocates, or needing to defend every belief, but I do think we can end up more smug or arrogant than we deserve if we only engage with moronic trolls.  4) **It makes us defined by our opposition.** This one's a bit more nebulous, but we know we live in a time of record \"anti-partisanship,\" where more people than ever before vote to stop the opposition's agenda rather than to advance their own. This usually encourages a type of legislative paralysis where we end up celebrating the status quo, because the goal was \"beat them and stop negative change\" instead of \"enact positive change.\" I think we'd just be healthier if we spent more time upvoting those we support and trumpeting their words and deeds rather than trashing those we oppose.   Anyway, that's all. I'm excited to hear the thoughts of others.", "output": "1) It's not trolling if the people genuinely believe the argument. Do you think most of those people you mentioned are shills or true believers? I would put it at 50/50 at worst. Which means it's only half trolls.  2) I mean... does it? I know \"reasonable\" moderate conservatives that really just want the government to spend less and say they can't hear dog whistles who have certainly expressed disdain for both elected officials and conservative pundits. They still listened to Rush. That doesn't mean they are a monolith though.  3) Just because you're mocking someone else's absurd beliefs doesn't mean you don't scrutinize your own. These aren't mutually exclusive. Also you didn't demonstrate why it makes us dumber. You said it causes us not to scrutinize our beliefs. There are tons of very intelligent people who are incapable of self reflection.  4). No disagreement here but in a plurality system that's essentially unavoidable. I don't vote *for* Democrats. I vote *against* Republicans. That totally sucks but until we move to ranked choice, eliminate the EC, and make gerrymandering illegal we're stuck with it."}}

The potential destruction that nuclear weapons are capable of causing is catastrophic, and their existence has created a constant threat of global conflict and destruction. Additionally, the production and maintenance of nuclear weapons is costly and diverts resources that could be used for other purposes. Furthermore, the fear of a nuclear conflict has had a destabilizing effect on international relations and has led to numerous close calls and tense standoffs.  While it is also true that there has not been a war between nuclear-armed states since World War II, it is not clear that this is directly due to the existence of nuclear weapons. It is possible that other factors, such as the formation of international organizations and the increased interconnectedness of the global economy, have played a role in preventing such conflicts. Furthermore, the use of nuclear weapons in warfare is generally considered to be unacceptable, and the vast majority of countries have committed to not using them"}}

{"item": {"input": "CMV: Parents who have no custody over their children should not be required to pay child support. So this comparison came up in another thread and I thought it was apt.   If a parent or parents decide they do not wish to keep their child they can relinquish it to the state and not be involved in its life.  The adoptive parents, assuming there are some, don't receive monthly child support checks from the biological parents.  We recognize that a biological parent who has no involvement in their spawn's life is not financially responsible for that child if they don't want to be.   This changes if only one parent wants responsibility but the other does not.  If Parent A says they have no interest in a child, but Parent B says they do, Parent A ends up paying Child Support to Parent B.  My argument is that for Parent A the decision is the same in both cases.  She or he is not involved in the child's life and has no custody.  The decision is the same on their part and therefore the result should be the same from that decision: they aren't financially liable.   The onus of raising a child should be on the parent(s) raising it, and not on the biological parent(s) who have no hand in raising the child.  _____  > *Hello, users of CMV!

I think that the reason at least many people care so much about what a candidate is like is because they are uninformed about what their candidates stand for, and so they go based on gut feeling and personal impressions as opposed to actual items of importance. I understand that personality is important to an extant. It helps politicians win over other politicians, and is helpful for anything involving negotiation. But it shouldn\u2019t be prioritized above the actual policies, and the fact that likeability is seen as more important is a major reason why we have so many political issues in America. _____ > *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

It caused a ton of newsand got everyone talking about it. His job numbers are great and that's partially thanks to Obama, but Trump has continued the trend to a very prosperous state. A politician that doesn't have the personality to motivate will always lose, regardless of platform. You may agree or disagree with Trump, but you can't deny more people than ever are engaged in politics all over the globe and people are standing up for what they believe in even more. I believe we are in a huge turning point in our existance as humans since cultures can now interact almost unimeded thanks to instant messaging and translation apps.

Most of us look at it as just another piece of the artist's toolkit, but the fact is that glitter was weaponized long ago by people willing to send envelopes full of glitter to your enemies, or even by the infamous porch-pirate revenge video who used weaponized glitter not once, but twice.   Now, let's look at why glitter should not be available to the general public:  1) It's a pollutive nuisance - glitter can't be recycled, and using it on regular paper materials means those can't be recycled either. Glitter can make its way into waterways and from there via fish directly into the food chain. There are already record levels of microplastic contamination discovered in tap water.   2) It's a health hazard - glitter can irritate your skin, or make its way in to your eyes and even blind you. The British Medical Journal has urged doctors to look out for patients complaining of swollen eyes and vision loss after a 49-year-old woman was almost blinded after glitter rubbed off a Christmas card into her eye. It had formed into a clump, causing a lesion. According to Frank Kelly, a professor of environmental health at King\u2019s College London, \"[Glitter] could deliver chemicals to the lower parts of our lungs and maybe even into our bloodstream\".  3) It's dangerous to have around the house - the fact that glitter is sold to everyone willy-nilly means that parents buy it for their children, who are not the sturdiest of creatures at the best of times. Knock over glitter once, and your home is no longer hospitable. Vacuuming or sweeping can never collect all the glitter, and once you knock it over, it becomes an actual menace/hazard: babies and pets can ingest the glitter, it gets all over everything, and all members of the household will transport the glitter throughout the house, extending it's reach and range.  Glitter should be treated similar to any other chemical hazard which can cause drastic pollution, poison food chains, cause physical damage to multiple different systems of the body, and similar to some chemical agents and weapons, are extremely hard to purify an area once glitter begins to spread.  I'm not saying that we should ban all glitter, as recommends Dr. Trisia Farrelly, an environmentalist from New Zealand\u2019s Massey University (\"I think all glitter should be banned. Producers should not get away with making a profit out of the production of disposable, single-use plastics, while bearing little responsibility for the damage.\").

{"item": {"input": "I believe the \"men's rights\" argument holds no water and is mainly championed by those who don't understand feminism, CMV Feminism affects both men and women. Certainly we associate femininity with the female sex, but that's exactly the reason why it affects men as well. The modern face of feminism is one that attempts to break down societal gender constructs, i.e. femininity = woman, masculinity = man, while empowering both men and women to rise above them.   I am a man but I've been an ardent femininist for my entire life, and it pains me to see ridiculous and often ill-informed opinions on one of society's most prevalent issues. Men seem to feel threatened by feminism, as if empowering women means to de-empower men. This is not true in the slightest! Any legitimate, academic discussion of feminism acknowledges that gender constructs affect men to a great degree, and I've yet to meet a single educated feminist who would disagree. I understand that there are radicalists in every movement out there, but fringe opinions do not affect my beliefs.  The men's rights movement (which I truly hope only exists on the internet) is unnecessary. Men have held positions of power for millennia - is it really necessary for us to feel better about being a man? Where feminism seeks to tear down the ideas of being male and female, men's rights activists (or should I say, soapbox preachers) seem to do nothing but boost male egos.

He refused to get out of the car or acknowledge me. A few moments later, a police officer arrived. The other guy jumped out of his car, shook the officer's hand, and said, \"Thanks for coming, Dave.\"    The officer took his statement, and didn't say a word to me other than to ask me for my insurance card. He went back to his patrol car, walked over to me, and handed me a summons.    He said, \"You're receiving a citation for failure to yield. You can pick up the police report in 3-5 business days at the police station.\"    When I informed him that I had a green arrow and the other vehicle had, in fact, gone through a red light, he chuckled and said, \"The other driver is a Captain on our fire department. He's driven our engine safely through more intersections than you've ever seen. I don't want to hear it.\"    I replied, \"But I have...\"    He put his hand up in my face and said, \"You're not getting out of this by lying to me. You can attempt to contest your citation in court. I'll see you there.\"     I picked up the police report and it says that the opposing driver had a green light as he approached the intersection. As he entered the intersection, I drove into the intersection at a high rate of speed turning left without yielding, impeding the other driver's path and causing the collision. It says that when I questioned I did not dispute the other driver's account of the accident and was issued a summons.

Instead, we need to pass laws that make deceptive advertising open to civil suits for deceptive practices and further criminal prosecution if the deception amounts to fraud.  Things like pharmaceuticals should be banned from advertising, because you shouldn't be asking your doctor to prescribe a certain drug. You go to the doctor because they are trained to choose the proper drug for you and they have the skills to understand the documentation that explains what the drug is and how it works.  By opening advertisement up to lawsuits for damages they cause, if an advertisement is targeted at a minor and this causes problems for the parent, then the parent should be allowed to sue for damages, including punitive ones if applicable.  Outright bans don't usually work except in certain cases because ad firms have lawyers who will just find a way around the ban.

In Scotland, 95% of people on public transport and in shops wear masks. In England, about 2% seem to. The point of bringing this up, is to make the point that if we want people to wear masks, we do basically need to tell them they have to, as most people are too stupid to do it without the government telling them to.   As for the mask mandates themselves, I have never heard a good argument against them. I often hear people say things like \"oh so should we have mask mandates for the flu then\", I don't see how this is a counter. I would be happy to wear a mask for a few months in winter when the flu is most prominent, and if there is a particularly bad flu strain, then telling people to wear masks seems justifiable even if only to reduce money spent in healthcare, not to mention that hospitals often get overwhelmed in winter.

There are medical exceptions, which I do think should be allowed, although maybe with a slightly higher burden of proof than we have now. And I've heard good argument for why kids shouldn't wear them, although those argument are stuff like \"they need to be able to see each others faces to develop emotional intelligence\", not \"it's child abuse\" or some stupid shit like that.

Conversely, my corner store 2 blocks from my house carries light cream, half/half and every other ingredient I would otherwise need for a basic recipe.  Can I safely substitute light cream or half/half (at different ratios) for the heavy cream, or is there some other chemistry involved that will affect the end result?  Example:  Depending on your sources,  * Heavy cream is ~36% fat. * Light cream is ~20% fat. * Half/half is ~12% fat. * Whole milk is ~3.5% fat.

(x * 0.2 + (3-x) * 0.035) / 3= 0.14     (x * 0.2 + 3 * 0.035 - x * 0.035) = 0.43     x * (0.2 - 0.035) = 0.325     x ~= 1.97 ~= 2  Thus 2 cups light cream and one cup whole milk.

Today, my boss said they had some complaints that I was discriminating in my hiring process by not hiring low GPA candidates.   Some of the staff that we are hiring for have expressed very specific requests (no lower than a 3.5 gpa) while others do not care as long as the candidate is good. I tend to stick pretty close to the 3.5 rule, but have hired lower GPA candidates if they interview well and would be a good fit for the team.  This year especially, I have received significant amounts of praise for my new hires and how smoothly they have transitioned into the roles as opposed to the person who previously hired for my team, and I feel this is directly a result of my stricter interviews and hiring criteria.   Given that we tend to interview a lot of college students, I do look at their GPAs as I feel it is a direct reflection on their work ethic. My boss is willing to hire employees as low as 2.5 GPA, which I don't think is in the best interest of the company unless they are a rockstar candidate with a good explanation.

{"item": {"input": "I live in Washington State. Can I be prosecuted for gifting my terminally ill father a firearm? Throwaway for obvious reasons.  My father is, and has been, very sick for about a year. He was diagnosed with two different forms of aggressive, untreatable lymphomas. He has nerve death in his feet from years of alcohol abuse (been clean for about 8 years, though!). He had to have his spleen removed earlier this year, and he has several other health issues that I'm not particularly familiar with because I'm not a doctor and don't understand the terminology, most of which are related to his cancers.  For the year+ since his first cancer diagnosis, he's been pretty elevated about the whole deal. He's made it very clear to my siblings, my stepmother, and I that he does \\*not\\* want a long, drawn-out old person death. He already has a DNR/DNI order on his chart, and has repeatedly said to all of us that he's happy with the way his life shook out and he's ready to leave the world. This was when he knew he was terminally ill, but was still relatively healthy and mobile.  Well, last week he had a major health crisis. Because I'm not a doctor I don't really understand the details, but the MAST cells in his system caused an enormous anaphylactic reaction that caused his blood pressure to drop. He also had an infection in his lungs that needed to be treated with an aggressive course of antibiotics. Worst, though, was that something about this incident triggered four different strokes. Three were relatively minor, but the fourth was a medium-to-large-sized event.  My sister, stepmother, and I have been taking shifts with him in the hospital since the event. He's having trouble finding words, but is still capable of expressing himself for the most part. Through all the physical therapy, medications, and hours of sitting in a hospital room, he has made it absolutely clear that the lifesaving interventions we put him through after the stroke were way too much and he would rather die than go through any of it again. He has begged us to change his physician's order for life saving treatment (POLST) form to specify that he should not receive treatment for similar events in the future.  The thing that's driving me nuts about this situation is that our stepmother (who has durable power of attorney) is having a very easy time dismissing these statements as \"oh he's just depressed\" and has been dragging her feet on changing the POLST form and other preparations to fulfill his wish of getting the fuck out of the hospital, back to his retirement home, and getting a chance to say bye to his family and friends before going through the lengthy process of a physician assisted suicide. My sister (who's in medical school) believes that he won't get to the point of a PAS, and believes he'll go next time he has a similar event like the one he had. The big issue I'm concerned about is whether this event happens before the POLST form is changed. If that happens, and he's saved again to come back in an even more disabled state, my father is going to die hating us, and I can't live with that.  Things REALLY came to a head yesterday at the hospital. I'd never seen my dad cry before in my life. I'd also never seen him get so angry. Before my stepmother got there, he begged me to bring him a gun so he has a way out in case things got even worse. Even with his speech impaired from the stroke, he told my stepmother and me in no uncertain terms that he hated us for being so selfish and cruel by keeping him around.  I doubt my father would put a bullet in his head if he had a gun. I think he just wants one so he knows that if things get too unbearable, he knows he can end it all in a split second, rather than having to hold on and wait for another stroke, or heart attack, or infection to end everything, or waiting for the gears of the state to slowly turn to the point where he can have his PAS. But I believe that everyone on earth should have the agency to decide when, where, and how they die, and he is and clearly has been suffering horribly for the last week and a half.  If I were to roll to the gun store and get him a firearm, and he shot himself with it, what would be the legal ramifications for me? I'm okay with my family hating me and even being vindictive.

My assessment of this is that the person's refusal to engage is because they don't know how to respond to some of the counter-points/arguments and so they choose to ignore it, or attack the person rather than the argument. Also, since they have a tendancy to get angry/agitated, they never end up hearing the opposing arguments and, therefore, never really have a chance to properly understand where there might be flaws in their own ideas (i.e., they are in a bubble).   The result is that they just end up dogmatically holding an idea in their mind.

How could we microscopically differentiate between a material at high voltage and low voltage?  I used to think that the high voltage wire would be positively charged and the low voltage one would be negatively charged (again, these are REAL wires so they can hold a little bit of charge).

So a battery has no \"voltage\" until you measure it because you need to indeed close the circuit to measure the \"push\" of the electrons, which is the voltage, hence why voltage is also called the electric potential. Interestingly enough, electrons move from the negative post of a battery to the positive post, but if you look at DC electrical diagrams, the arrows show the current as if it's flowing from the positive post of the battery.  Electricity is an observable work of nature trying to equalize itself, all the time.

Throughout 2016's election, I saw a crazy number of articles from left-leaning sources about how liberals needed to \"reach across the aisle\" and attempt to truly understand why someone might vote for Donald Trump. We were asked to conceptualize their struggles and empathize with their suffering, to acknowledge their humanity and their pain.  Vox beseeched liberals to listen to Trump voters' concerns. The Atlantic profiled Trump supporter after Trump supporter to dispel the conventional wisdom that they were all racist boomers or antisocial white nationalists. USA today did the same. 538 did repeated statical analysis to disprove those stereotypes. The New York Times told us to \"stop shaming Trump voters\". The Washington Post suggested we empathize with Trump voters. Hell, even the quite literally Socialist magazine Jacobin made the same request.  Meanwhile, reviews of books about rural white working class society became vehicles for left-leaning publications to ask readers to feel pity for the underserviced social sectors that became Trump voters. \"Hillbilly Elegy\" and \"Strangers In Their Own Land\", for example.  My question, then is this: Why isn't the Right held to the same standard?   Where is the Fox News op-ed about how Trump voters need to work to understand the root cause of BLM? When hasn't the Wall Street Journal ever profiled an Antifa member or a climate activist or even just a bunch of Biden voters in general? When can we expect the Washington Times to do a multipart series on how the struggles of indebted students, DREAMers and the LGBT community led them to vote Democrat?

It was had to understand why someone would vote for Trump because he was a perplexing candidate, even as the incumbent. His rhetoric was inflammatory, his behavior unpredictable, and his views idiosyncratic or arbitrary. He wasn't typical for a Republican or a presidential candidate.

Most local butchers just don't have the recourses to do that.

I suspect they don't actually do what they say when it comes to \"cruelty free\" and \"free range\".   But if they actually did do those things, then I believe the concept at play here is that it's suppose to be a lot closer to how the \"circle of life\" would work in the wild. That they'd be hunted and killed by some predator anyway. So if you give them a similar lifestyle as they'd have on average in the wild before killing them... then that is somehow \"better\". But this is dependent on thinking that \"the wild\" is an environment to aspire to.  I happen to think that simulating the average lifestyle of the animal in the wild is a good thing so I appreciate the concept of Free Range & Cruelty Free - I just question sometimes if they really do what they say."}}

Questions regarding strength, weight, and cost for cars Howdy -   I was thinking about future fuel regulations today and thinking about how the industry will meet them.  To me it seems there are two ways to make today's style cars meet those regulations - through more efficient engines and hybrid drivetrains and by channeling Colin Chapman who said \"simplify and add lightness.\"    The IC engine has become dramatically more efficient in the past 20 years through better computers, direct injection, variable valve timing, new materials, better FI, etc., so it seems that gains there are going to be incremental.  Hybrid drive trains are certainly a big possibility, especially if a consumer friendly KERS system is developed or battery tech takes off.  Other advances such as electric power steering and low RR tires that actually hold the road can also help with efficiency.  **I'd like to focus this question on \"adding lightness.\"**  I am a Lotus fan and that company, more than anyone, has traditionally focused on lightweight vehicles, most recently though the use of luminum \"tubs\" and chassis.  A nice video is here: Lotus aluminum bonding  In fact, Lotus Engineering has pioneered and licensed a lot of the tech involved (link).    In terms of \"tubs\" and chassis components, aluminum is much lighter than steel, but also costs significantly more and is not very \"repairable,\" making seemingly minor wrecks a total loss.  Carbon fiber is certainly lighter, but costs much more and cannot be manufactured quickly.  Can anyone offer anymore on this topic?  In terms of body panels, it used to be that fiberglass was lighter than steel - is that still true?  How much weight is saved by the use of carbon fiber?  Is aluminum still lighter than steel?  Where does plastic fit into all of this?  Are there any other options for lightweight body panels?

I am referring to those two teams specifically, because they have that permission from tribal council - if those tribes allow it, who are we to tell them to change it?  2) I understand that it is extremely hard for POC voice actors to break into the profession. However, that needs to be reminded by new character being created & cast, not white voice actors being pushed out a job they've held for years to not get \"cancelled.\" The majority of people who were calling for the man who voiced Cleveland to step down were white. I also understand that  On that note, I believe that we need to defer to POC/minorities when a certain character is in question - Speedy Gonzales is a good example. White people pushed for his removal while Mexicans and Mexican-Americans protested for him to stay! It's not for us, people who are not in that community, to decide whether a character is good or bad. The creator of Ghost in the Shell LOVED the casting of Scarlett Johansson - which was accurate anyway because the robot that the main character resides in is outwardly European - casting an Asian woman would've been inaccurate to the story. But who complained? White Americans!  3) Dragging videos/tweets/etc made years or even a decade plus ago by famous people or influencers does nothing and implies that society as a whole refuses to forgive such transgressions and that there's no reason to try and strive to be better because it won't be believed anyway - especially when they've already apologized for it and there's no other instances of such behavior recently. Jenna marbles got bullied off of YouTube for videos she made almost a DECADE ago and had already apologized for, and there were no other questionable videos since then. What, then, is the point of dredging it up years later?  I feel the same with issues involving cultural appropriation - I constantly see white people putting down other white people for *appreciating* a culture I stead of appropriating it, when POC aren't even complaining about that specific issue - did the Polynesian people care that little white girls wanted to be Moana for Halloween, or did WHITE PEOPLE care so they could look enlightened?  In conclusion, I understand that, as we have privilege, we need to use our voices to help POC and minorities. But I believe there are two main issues:  - We end up talking OVER them and trying to tell them what they should be offended by, which implies they're not intelligent enough to decide by themselves/is incredibly infantilizing.  - We pull years old tweets and attack influencers and celebrities while refusing to believe that they have changed in the years since and also see that behavior as problematic now in an attempt to virtue signal and act like a good person.  I just really don't think that this is the way to legitimately help POC - obviously if they also agree there is an issue that's not the case, but I also think that problematic behavior from the past should be forgiven if that person has worked to become better - but we refuse to believe that it's not a publicity stunt when they do.", "output": "Sometimes it does take a white person saying \u201cMaybe you aren\u2019t seeing what is said behind your back- in coffee break rooms and at family dinners, but I know the attitudes it\u2019s creating for other people that they don\u2019t show to *you*\u2019 directly, and they are problematic\u201d.    We can\u2019t be expected to change people\u2019s attitudes if we aren\u2019t allowed to speak up about the small things that are woven into society that we know are reinforcing the big things POC want changed.

Onions are more expensive but require specific techniques- they can be diced and then frozen on a sheet tray, then transferred to freezer bags and used in any cooked application. To practice julienning them, make some caramelized onions- they cook down so much that you'll get a decent practice session in just making one batch. To practice difficult, extremely small cuts like brunoise (perfect 1/16\" cubes, just about as small as you can possibly cut), do a 2:2:1 (measured after cutting) mix of turnips, carrots and leeks- they can be blanched separately, drained, then frozen in the same manner as described for diced onions and used in sauces or as a garnish. You'll also get plenty of julienning practice in the process.  Cutting bell peppers is something where going pro really gives you an advantage- at upwards of $5 a pop, getting to practice on entire cases of peppers is a privelege. Still, the technique of coring peppers by \"unrolling\" them on the cutting board isn't THAT difficult and if you're proficient in other knife skills, should only take a few peppers to get comfortable enough to do it in front of others without feeling like a dunce.  I think classes are a waste of time and money- just keep cooking, keep researching techniques, and find what's best and most comfortable for you. Take care of your knives- just a steel isn't enough, get a waterstone and learn how to use it. Don't send them to a pro to sharpen them, even as a serious home cook, they will need to be sharpened far too often to be cost effective, and you will find yourself working with sub-par equipment until you can be arsed to send your knives out.

For the sake of this argument let\u2019s ignore that helping the less fortunate has a positive effect on society and thus benefits all members as they clearly don\u2019t believe that.  According to the dictionary, selfish means \u201clacking consideration for other people; concerned chiefly with one's own personal profit or pleasure\u201d, so I think it\u2019s pretty clear that the people who think along these lines are selfish.  I also think that they are not the smartest either, as a selfish but logical person would see that the best option for them is to have the security of an available and accessible welfare network even if they won\u2019t need it. Let\u2019s look at the options:  A. *There is no welfare system in place and you would\u2019ve needed it.* Clearly a bad situation.  B. *There is no welfare system in place and you never end up needing it.* Congratulations, you were lucky. However, you lived your life knowing that your luck might not hold and you\u2019re just one unexpected event away from being in a situation where you could have benefited from a safety net. You had an accident/got sick and now you\u2019re disabled/can\u2019t work? Too bad. You found out you\u2019re pregnant but can\u2019t afford to raise the child as a single parent? Tough luck.

C. *There is a welfare system in place and you end up needing it.* It\u2019s great that there was help available but it sucks that you fell on hard times. Not an ideal situation.  D. *There is a welfare system in place and you never end up needing it.* Most ideal situation. You lived a relatively comfortable life with the added reassurance that, were something to change, you wouldn\u2019t be on your own.  **Thus, my view is that on top of being selfish, they are not the smartest either as, all other things being equal, having the safety net of social welfare and not needing it is the best/most logical option.**  Ideally, I would like my view changed on both aspects, but proving that they are either not selfish or smart is also ok.

{"item": {"input": "How to thank your Vet? Our 2y M Goldador Gus decided to dry his insides with a towel, and we have had an extremely stressful week. A 2am visit to the emergency Vet, and they suggested pancreatitis. I wasn't convinced and requested an anti-emetic and sub-cut pain relief to last the 5 hours until my Vet opened.   Imaging confirmed a bowel obstruction and surgery ensued, with 1 length of towel from his stomach, through the length of his colon and well into his bowel. During this time he regurgitated and aspirated. He was hung off the table and the Vet was very concerned.   https://imgur.com/a/WrrgHWe  He was on the mend at home until yesterday morning when he was showing signs of infection. He had actually been seen by a Vet the previous afternoon and everything was progressing well. I work in the medical field, and got him to the Vet, fearing sepsis.   The staff at the vet have been incredible. They closed in the afternoon, with a vet and nurse staying with him until the vet went home after 9pm, the nurse did a 14 hour shift and swapped with another vet at midnight. The same nurse was back at 4am to swap again. This is not a 24 hour clinic.   They let my wife and I hang around with our dog, and we got him walking and urinating. All three of us were comforted by being allowed to be there.   While hanging around, I chatted with the Vet about my admiration for their role. They had experienced a very difficult day, with a routine surgery resulting in the loss of a dog. I understand resuscitation of this animal went for a number of hours and was unexpected by all. The vet was very upset by it.   My field of work has a long and dark history of suicide and mental health conditions, but we have coping mechanisms - both formal and informal. We also enjoy very defined relationships with our patients with the relationship starting and ending over the course of 1 - 2 hours. The impact of our role is still too much for many people.   I cannot fathom how hard vets and vet staff have it.   Clinics are either small with a limited number of practitioners, with long and drawn out relationships with patients who can't talk and owners who can't seem to listen. It's not like there is a bar that vets get to hang out in and debrief. They go home and think about their ongoing cases and get up in the middle of the night to continue working on them. It must be lonely and it must be consuming.   I understand the risks with my boy, and that's why I was so quick to get him back to care when his situation changed. My dogs are my world, and a big part of my coping mechanisms for dealing with my work related stressors. It doesn't matter if it is 3pm or 3am when I walk through the door... I always get greeted with love. When I am in a dark place, I have 2 labs ready to retrieve me. I can't express what loosing one unexpectedly would do to me.

Within Omicron, there are variants that are of the same type, but not identical. You might think if it as members of the same family. They're not the same, but the relationship - that is, the heritable similarities - is a simple matter to discern. My understanding is that variants and subvariants are a matter of how the spike protein (the bit of the virus that binds to human cells) has changed to better cross the cellular membrane to replicate itself.  There's nothing stopping new variants from emerging; it's just that the most successful variants at the moment all are related."}}

The apartment I found is a small efficiency in an older building.  They agreed to a standard lease for the first six months, followed by month to month lease.  I was to be the first tenant, when I toured it six weeks ago, workers were painting the rooms.  The landlords son is living upstairs, and this is my landlords first time renting.  The lease was obviously pulled from a form and seemed standard.  There is a clause in the lease which states that I can't install curtains rods or hooks.  This seemed standard as well, I had similar at my old apartment.  I assumed there would be some sort of curtain provided, and this was in regards to additional curtains.  I moved in Sunday, and found the landlord had not installed curtains at all.  At this point, I assumed the issue with curtains was the potential to damage to the wall.  So, I bought tension rods that require no hardware and used them to hang curtains.  Monday afternoon I got a text from my landlord saying I needed to remove the curtains.  The building is on a street corner with a fair amount of foot traffic.  Between the four windows, you can see all of my apartment with the exception of the portion of the bathroom with the toilet and tub.  Not only does this mean I have no privacy, but the neighborhood is slightly sketchy after dark.  The nearby buildings have bars on their windows.  Anyone passing by not only can see my possessions, but whether or not I am home.  I expressed this to the landlord in my reply over text.  He replied to reread my lease.  I left them up overnight.  I had orientation this morning and came back to find the curtains removed and no where in the apartment.  I discovered this before entering the building, as two guys were outside one of my windows and looking in my apartment.  They left when I entered the building.  I messaged the landlord saying he didn't have the right to enter the apartment and asked for the curtains back.  He again said to check my lease and then commented that I needed to finish unpacking as it looked messy in my apartment.  I had to head to a work event so I couldn't follow through more, but I moved my electronics to one corner and used a bookshelf to block one of the windows so they weren't visible.  While at the event, I got a text from the landlord with a picture of the blocked window, captioned \"whatts this\"  What can I do to prevent my landlord from entering the apartment unannounced and to compel him to allow some form of curtain?

I hate both parties but I hate one party significantly more. Here are my primary concerns. There are *individuals* in both parties that I agree with on certain policies (again, nearly all Dems and Independents) but that's about it.  1. Gerrymandering is bad for numerous reasons including unfairness and being anti-democratic. 2. This move entrenches the tactic in state and federal politics. Whereas previously at least Dems had motivation to eliminate partisan gerrymandering via legislation since they are now approximately equal beneficiaries (or will be if they keep it up) they will likely stop fighting to eliminate it. 3. This policy allows non-Dems to declare \u201cboth sides\u201d with validity on this issue (whereas previously it was not a valid argument as it was clear the GOP gerrymandered worse/more). 4. Overall, this represents a stalemate at state levels where now we have a set of deep red or deep blue states which will essentially be locked into their political affiliations permanently. This will increase corruption in those states as there will be no political recourse (the voters no longer matter).

Companies would pay their workers more, those workers would use this money to buy more products, money would flow more consistently through the economy, and more wealth creating transactions would occur.  On the other hand, if instead of seeing this as a possible outcome these large companies do outsource all the jobs, the economy would stagnate because the largest consumer base in the country (working class) would be largely unemployed and there would be nobody to buy these products except the Chinese children getting paid 10 cents an hour to make the damn things."}}

I'm a thesis track Master's student currently in my 3rd year (6th semester). I was supposed to graduate last semester but delayed to this semester to give me more time to process data and perform analyses. My progress has been significantly slowed by unforeseen analytical issues, but mostly my advisor has been incredibly distant. I'm not looking for validation on that front - I've already had multiple discussions with my department's administration (including the chair) about my experiences, and they've all been appalled at how I've been treated. For the rest of the post, please keep that in mind.  I have 90% of my first chapter written, but my advisor is now floating the idea of me graduating in the summer or fall instead of this spring. They are concerned they may not have enough time to review my drafts before I defend in mid-April. They do not have any more funding for me, so they'd force me to pay my university's fees to stay a student while I finish up. However, I already have a job lined up that does not care about my degree, and I care way more about the work I'm doing with them than I care about my Master's. If I do not graduate this semester, that job immediately takes priority for me. I already plan on being very open about how my priorities will shift.  So, what are my options if my advisor wants to delay my defense?  1. I could go along with the delay and put the bare minimum into finishing up. This would cost me roughly $1,000 per semester. I am not a fan of this option. 2. I could attempt to force them to let me defend and graduate by threatening to quit altogether. I am my PI's first student, and two other students have already quit on top of misuse of university funds. If I leave, my PI will likely have to wait another 2.5 years for a student to graduate and produce any papers. That's 6 years of being a tenure-track professor with no students graduated or publications or presentations from their work. My advisor is incredibly vulnerable. 3. I could switch advisors and go with a non-thesis track degree. This would likely forfeit any publications with my current advisor or our collaborators. My entire thesis is based on a collaboration with a government agency, and our partner at that agency is on my committee. That committee member has been incredibly supportive and understanding, but I doubt I could publish with just them with our data. This option would also still result in a major delay in my graduation. 4. I could quit altogether.  I am incredibly frustrated at the moment and thinking somewhat irrationally, but I feel like I am being abused. For my own mental health, I need to be done as soon as possible, and I am very close to prioritizing my own wellbeing over a piece of paper.

Taking two and a half months to review two chapters seems ridiculous, and it sounds to me like they're just dragging you along and denying you funding so they can get more work done through you. I'm sorry this is happening, OP, but if you already have a job lined up that excites you and doesn't depend on your degree, this seems like the best option to save you money, time, and more importantly your mental health."}}

Wade, I\u2019ve seen a lot about the differences in how a fetus is perceived by the Jewish faith tradition as opposed to Christianity. Where did this split come from, theologically? Perhaps just anecdotal evidence, but after the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe, I saw quite a few posts on social media about how the decision infringes on the religious liberties of Jews, since that faith tradition views a fetus as part of the mother and thus does not have the same ideological opposition to abortion as, say, evangelical Christians.   Leaving aside of validity of the political/legal argument, I\u2019m curious as the theological divide in perception. Where did this come from? Or am I way off base?", "output": "In the Greco-Roman world in the first three centuries CE, under the influence of customary pagan belief and practice, abortion and the abandonment of unwanted infants was commonplace, and not terribly controversial. These two acts were also identified with one another as generally a single practice. There were pagan critics of the practice, notably Cicero in his defense of Aulus Cluentius Habitus. And there is some debate as to whether the practice was more seen as a \"regrettable necessity\", in the words of McCulloch, or was seen callously as a routine part of life. But in either case, the widespread practice of abortion and infant-killing was a widely-understood fact of life in the pre-Christian Mediterranean.  Jews, however, seem to have rejected this practice from at least the 2nd or 1st century BCE, (if not much earlier), and this discrepancy did not go unnoticed by their Greek neighbors. Tacitus notes (Chapter 5) that they consider killing infants to be a crime. He does not consider this to be a compliment, and lists this custom among others he calls \"base and abominable\". Whether or not he is correct in his assertion that Jews categorically considered it unlawful, it certainly speaks volumes that he considered it a barbaric trait for them to do so.  As to if and when abortion, as a procedure performed prior to natural birth, became divested from this broader concept in Jewish law, I will leave to another commenter, but from my research and understanding of Mediterranean late-antiquity, it was not yet so distinguished.  Christianity, in the first several centuries of its existence, as you're probably aware, experienced an acute identity crisis between its Hebrew and Greek cultural heritage. Many early Christian writers, such as Tertullian, the author of the Epistle to Barnabas, and the author(s) of the Didache, (to name a few), all embraced their Greek inheritance. They insisted that one could be a Hellene and a Christian, and indeed that the titans of Hellenic Philosophy comported with Christian teachings. However, despite the fact that these authors were happy to underline their Hellenic character, and did not at all seek to emulate Jewish culture and practice wholesale, even these Greek-leaning Christians broke radically with their pagan kinsmen on the question of abortion, and accepted the Jewish custom of considering it to be both a sin and a crime.  All early Christian communities abhorred abortion and infant-killing, and Jewish sentiment too was consistently opposed to it - Josephus and Philo both expressly forbade it. The Didache, the Apocalypse of Peter/Apocalypses/The_Apocalypse_of_Peter), and the Apolegoticum, are examples of early Christian writings that also expressly forbade it.  In short, for the first several centuries of their co-existence, Judaism and Christianity were in accord. They considered infant-killing to be a crime, and they considered invasive abortion prior to birth as the same thing. Polemics between Jews, Jewish Christians, and Hellenic Christians tend to obscure areas of alignment, but it's clear that from the perspective of the outsider - the pagan Greco-Roman - Christians and Jews shared the same position at least until the fourth century.  For more information on how early Christian communities distinguished themselves from Hellenic society, and in what ways they accommodated themselves, see *The self-defining praxis of the developing ecclsesia* by Carolyn Ostek, published as Chapter 14 of The Cambridge History of Christianity, edited by Mitchell and Young.  For more information on the practice of infant killing, infant abandonment, and abortion in antiquity (and beyond), see *The Kindness of Strangers* by John Boswell. Excellent work.  I also consulted *Christianity - The First Three Thousand Years* by Diarmaid McColluch, specifically Chapter 4, \"Boundaries Defined\"."}}

{"item": {"input": "CMV: Culture accounts for significantly more than people are willing/able to admit Recently it's become \"not PC\" to talk about culture and its effects, especially in the US. I suspect this is because culture can be closely related to race.  However, many realities in the US are clearly influenced by culture. The most obvious example being the wealth disparities among different groups of people. Non-white populations all have significantly lower median household incomes. Of course racism and colonialism are relevant factors, but nigerians and asians face identical obstacles yet earn *significantly more* than white people do. Does anyone really believe it's simply a coincidence that one group's culture emphasizes education to an extreme degree while the other's glorifies sports, music, etc? I feel the reality is obvious. I know nigerian/asian immigrants who came to the US with literally nothing and within two generations their family holds tremendous wealth. Their children weren't focusing on being athletes or rappers, they instead they worked to become doctors.   Of course I acknowledge systemic inequalities exist. The US is now famous for that. But I don't see how anyone can argue culture doesn't explain a *lot* of what we see in the world.

{"item": {"input": "CMV: Laws should be clearly defined, including all special circumstances Taking this from a programming/absolutist approach, where any and all laws should be clearly defined so anyone can clearly tell if they broke the law or not.   Any special exceptions that have not been defined can still go to court, and based on the outcome of the court case that exception gets added to the law.  Anything that has been defined does not see court and has an automatic outcome. If you think the automatic outcome is incorrect, you would need to significantly prove that a change is needed to the laws. Without significant proof, no court case.  This should overall make it clearer for what is and isnt legal, and keep the court system only for the corner cases - and eventually completely autonomous.  It would also remove the bias or corruption from individual judges or high profile criminals. Similarly the police force would be clear on what laws they can and can't enforce and why - removing police power trips or at least significantly reducing them, as they can be held accountable.  Apart from the people in power not wanting to be subject to their own laws, is there any other serious flaws with this concept? (Comparing to our current system)", "output": "The main issue is that the world is *complicated*.  This might not even be possible given the vast range of scenarios that would need to be covered.  If they did manage to write a legal code that covered all factors, it would be so convoluted that even the best lawyers would struggle to make sense of it.  It would easily result in a situation where a single case could take years to sort out because that's how long it takes to follow the flow charts and no one will really understand at the end what law they would be arguing needs to be changed if they want to.  Then, there is the fact that even under such a system, people would still have the right to argue that they constitute an edge case.  Even if the court decides they are not, they still have the right to argue that idea.  So, people who want to take their case to court instead of pleading out will still have that happen.  It will just make the legal arguments harder to understand for anyone who isn't a lawyer.  Another issue is this ruins the ability of regulations to be quickly adaptable.  In our current system, we have both laws and regulations.  Regulations are things that are enforced like laws but aren't actually laws.  Instead, a law will be passed giving an agency the authority to write regulations on a particular subject matter.  This allows for those regulations to be changed rapidly based on changing situations.  For many people, the difference doesn't actually affect them but for many industries getting decisions made at an agency level instead of through the legislature is critical for making things happen in a timely fashion.  Having a legislature vote setting fishing bag limits (for example) is a quick way to just not have any fish left.  Finally, many criminal cases that go to court aren't actually arguing over legal philosophy.  Instead, they have a disagreement on the very facts of the case.  It doesn't matter how clear the law is for a given situation if it is unclear what the situation is.  Inflexible laws don't help when the confusion comes not from the law but from the facts.  It is well and good to make robbing a liquor store always worth ten years in prison, but if it is unclear if you are seeing Steve or his brother Joe on the CCTV footage, you will still have all of the same kinds of issues you have now.  TL;DR:  It won't reduce court cases, it will make things slower to adjust, and it will make the law harder to understand."}}

I played for hours and hours.  Anyway, fast forward 20 years. PC gaming is pretty great, I love it and always will. But mobile gaming? Unbelievably bad.  Processing power has leaped forward thousands upon thousands of times since the 90s. Our mobile phones and tablets are lightyears faster than the **fastest** 90s PCs.

{"item": {"input": "What type of silicone would be best for a masturbation cup? Porous vs Softness Hi, kinda of odd but I want to independently create a fleshlight type sex toy. I have a ton of questions, and those \u201cask an expert\u201d websites seem to be dead so here I am.   TLDR;;; looking to create or find a non porous, non toxic soft material for a fleshlight. I don\u2019t understand what makes up \u202asilicone and how to learn more.    OK so from the information I\u2019ve read, the less porous the material is the softer it is, but non porous means it can be cleaned properly/no bacteria growth.\u202c So obviously I\u2019m looking for a material that is low on the shore a hardness scale but is still non porous. Phthalate is apparently bad because that is the cause of chemical burns with sex toys, but this is what would make the silicone soft?   I don\u2019t know which compounds that make up silicone that influence porosity, softness, heat retention and elasticity, durability etc etc. How does the curing method effect the silicone? I don\u2019t understand what it is I need to create a silicone soft enough for a masturbator cup. Is \u201cmedical grade\u201d and \u201cfood grade\u201d silicones just that because the structure of them is less porous? Could the same type of silicone that breast implants use work - and how would I even know how to convey the exact type of silicone formula I want to a factory? I assume the harder silicon that holds the liquid of a breast implant could be used as a coat layer in a masturbation cup, over a softer silicone material that would be toxic with direct contact. What\u2019s the formula of breast implants silicone? How would I learn if it would would be durable enough to hold, and not deteriorate when constantly rubbed? How would a know how durable a type of rubber would be if thinly spread?  But then I see there\u2019s other options like TPE/TPR. It has a low durometer, and the lower the durometer the softer the material...how is this different from the shore scale? I read \u201cTPE is generally considered body safe\u201d - generally, so not always? How can I learn what kinds of silicone are \u201cmedical grade\u201d or are platinum cured and how do they differ?

I took her in for her second round of vaccinations and to discuss potential dental cleaning as her breath was horrid.  &#x200B;  Backstory:  &#x200B;  I adopted her nearly 5 years ago. A dental expert estimated her age at about 5-7. She had horrid teeth. He removed 18 during a 2 hr surgery in Spring 2014. Even though I tried to brush them as best I could (she hated it) little by little tartar returned. In Nov 2016 she needed an emergency surgery for a bladder obstruction. Her bloodwork showed less than ideal liver numbers but she survived and had her teeth done again.  &#x200B;  Then in Nov 2017 I noticed her sleeping alot more. I noticed her eye was a little red. I took her for a senior check up and the doctor found a glaucoma. I tried treating it but she lost the eye in January 2018. Lost the second in March 2018. In February I had a eye puncture done to try and save her second eye but it failed so it was removed.  &#x200B;  With each of these surgeries I thought my dog was gonna die. The eye removals and bladder stones were emergencies and yet she lived.  &#x200B;  After her eyes were gone shr was unbothered. Lived her dog life. Didnt like walkig outside that much so I pushed her in a dog stroller. She was still eating etc. She was never \"active\" or playful. Just my dog.  &#x200B;  Jump to the present:  &#x200B;  Over the last few weeks Ive had a random (unexplained) anxiety about my dog dying. Like when I got home the first thing Id do was check that she was alive(?). She was 85% the same dog. But I did notice a few things:  &#x200B;  1. She was breathing more often through her mouth while asleep. She never did this but she is a smush faced dog so....  &#x200B;  2. She was panting indoors randomly. I attributed it to overheating (due to her long coat during summer) but it ws rare so I thought nothing much of it.  &#x200B;  2. She had a period of incontinence. She was peeing in her sleep and while standing (without squatting) without realizing it. And this is a dog who HATES her own urine. The vet did a bladder check and it was clear. Then for the next 6 weeks the incontinence stopped and she started getting up to use her in house pee pads again.  &#x200B;  3. About 4 weeks ago she started eating less. Usually she eats twice a day. But she was always picky (and blind) so I figured she was just not aware of the time. I bought her some cheaper (more fragrant) dog food and mixed it with water. She ate more at first. But then started eating once a day. Then eating 90% of the food a coming back for the rest hours later. 3 weeks ago she hadnt eating for like 36 hrs so I was worried. So I gave her some plain yogurt with low fat and water mixed in. She ate it. This is when I thought her teeth might be the reason. But again she simple returned to eating semi regularly. Though her love of table food waned. (Attributed to a sore mouth).  &#x200B;  Jump to today:  &#x200B;  I took her to the vet this morning. Discussed her teeth with the vet. I wanted to know the state of her mouth. And asked if it would be better to remove her leftover 22 teeth rather than putting her under again next year when she was even older.  &#x200B;  He said he needed an xray and inspection of the mouth. To get that he would have to put her under for a short time and he would need bloodwork and a heart and lung xray.  &#x200B;  So I agreed.  &#x200B;  Bloodwork came out mostly normal. Her inflammation numbers were up. But slightly above average.(likely cause of her mouth). Her anemic levels were low (slightly below average). All her number were normal or in 1-3 points of normal.  &#x200B;  This vet went through the same process for each surgery and was confident it was fine to proceed and I agreed. I handed over my dog and waited outside.  &#x200B;  Time passed. Other people were waiting. Both vets were in the OR with my dog. I could hear a machine beeping. But I remained calm because Ive heard that sound in surgeries before. 35 mins passed. I was getting a little worried. But figured they were working on another dog and mine was up next or got delayed and procedure started much later after they took her back.  &#x200B;  Then they called me in the exam room. I swear I was about to get my dog handed to me. And they asked me to come to the back.  &#x200B;  She was lying there with tubes in her mouth. Dead.  &#x200B;  They explained this:  &#x200B;  They administered a low level of propofol and when the medicine was pushed her lungs simply stopped pumping. They said this can happen in certain situations for a few seconds with dogs but the lungs will restart pumping. Hers didnt. So they pushed medicine to reactivate the heart. But it didnt work. So they tried for like 25 minutes to revive her and failed. She passed away and they never even got to the xray and exam.  &#x200B;  What the fuck?!?  &#x200B;  I couldnt believe it. She was old. But she her major organs were all in good health. She wasnt allergic to it as all her last procedures used the exact same medicine and in higher doses for a longer time.  &#x200B;  But this time it killed her. And I cant figure out why. They explained that this happened very rarely. And online research says the same. They are a busy vet and said this happens to them once a year but rarely twice.  &#x200B;  But what I cant find is an explaination. Why would a low dose of propofol cause lungs to simply stop? The only explaination I find online are all \"veterinary negligence\" which is possible. But in the years I went there when I heard  OR machines going both vets were always back there, the same as this time. Assuming it wasnt negligence on their part,  what could have caused it? Shock? I literally can find anything on it. Like no one studies the \"unknown\" anesthetic deaths or something but that cant be true.  &#x200B;  The more I think about it the more I feel like my dog was showing yellow flags that she was in a cognitive decline. Maybe she wasnt going to die right away, but she was slowly on her way. And this procedure at this moment pushed her over the edge and she died. And whatever caused it wasnt picked up by bloodwork tests or x rays.  &#x200B;  The vets arent bad people. Its possible they fucked up. But they seemed to be in just as much shock as I was. Because theyve done this hundreds of times before and this is the first sudden death in a while. They even paid for her funeral and cremation.  &#x200B;  I always figured she would get some acute disease like kidney failure and I would have time to  process her impending death and hold her while I put her down. She died at around 11:45 this morning. Thry told me at 12:13pm. I brought her ashes home at 3:00pm. And now her urn is sitting on a shelf in front of me.  &#x200B;  I had a dog exactly 12 hours ago.

So stealth is just like a mirror, instead of reflecting the radar light back at the radar building, it sends it off into space, so the radar building doesn't see anything \"shine\"."}}

Or would that totally eff up the recipe?  Any other thoughts?  Perhaps using more brown sugar/less white?  I love a soft and chewy cookie but this one isn't quite chewy enough for me.

But today, an A is the most common grade given in college; the percentage of A grades has tripled, to 45 percent nationwide. Seventy-five percent of all grades awarded now are either A\u2019s and B\u2019s. The National Association of Colleges and Employers reported in 2013 that \u201c66 percent of employers screen candidates by grade point average (GPA).\u201d  &#x200B;  \"The Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation also has studied college grading. The Foundation confirms the alarming findings recited above. It found that in 1969, only 7 percent of students at two- and four-year colleges reported that their grade point average was A-minus or higher. Yet in 2009, 41 percent of students reported as same. During the same period, the percentage of C grades given dropped from 25 to five percent.\"  &#x200B;  \"Under legislation proposed in the House of Representatives, the Texas \u201cContextualized Transcript\u201d bill calls for adding to transcripts the average grade given to the entire class for each of the courses on a student\u2019s transcript.

We've gotten the very clear, unambiguous message from the dean that our classes are too easy and need to become more rigorous (which of course would reduce inflation).   &#x200B;  At first I resisted but now I see the point. It's not doing students any favors, and apparently many P&T committees are wary of grade inflation and student evals that are TOO high.   &#x200B;  What are your universities doing about grade inflation?  &#x200B;", "output": "I'm proud to say that my particular department - physics - does not inflate grades. A typical sophomore-through-senior course (i.e., after the freshmen are \"weeded out\") for me might lead to an average of 2.7, with <20% As.

For private or home systems, we usually use a private water closet system where we know that the rate of usage of that toilet is far less than that of a public toilet.  Knowing those facts, mechanical engineers have created a set of numbers called fixture units (FU) so they can represent the likelihood of a system to use water, you can take an idea of them from such a website. You can realize that the public systems have higher FU, and adding the multiple FUs in your system, you can get the water demand in that toilet by checking such [graph.](http://docs.engineeringtoolbox.com/documents/1074/building_water_demand_fixtures_gal_min.png )  All in all, both private and public systems have a tank, but the public system has a bigger tank on the roof with more flow and a bigger pipe."}}

This is the place to apply for a flair \u2013 the colored text you will have seen next to some user's names indicating their specialization. We are always looking for new flaired users, and if you think you have what it takes to join the panel of historians, you're in the right place!  For examples of previous applications, and our current panel of historians, you can find the previous application thread here, and there is a list of active flaired users](/r/AskHistorians/wiki/flairedusers) on our wiki.  **[Requirements for a flair**  A flair in /r/AskHistorians indicates extensive, in-depth knowledge about an area of history *and* a proven track record of providing great answers in the subreddit. In applying for a flair, you are claiming to have:  * **Expertise in an area of history**, typically from either degree-level academic experience or an equivalent amount of self-study. For more exploration of this, check out this thread.  * The ability to **cite sources** from specialist literature for any claims you make within your area.  * The ability to provide **high quality answers** in the subreddit in accordance with our rules.    For a more in-depth look at how applications are analyzed, consult this helpful guide on our wiki explaining what an answer that demonstrates the above looks like.  **How to apply**  To apply for a flair, simply post in this thread. Your post needs to include:  * Links to **3-5 comments** in /r/AskHistorians that show you meet the above requirements, and of which at least three were posted in the last six months. Answers linked in an application should go 'above and beyond' the base requirements of the rules here, and reflect the depth of your expertise.  * The **text of your flair** and which category it belongs in (see the sidebar). Be as specific as possible as we prefer flair to reflect the exact area of your expertise as near as possible, but be aware there is a limit of 64 characters.  One of the moderators will then either confirm your flair or, if the application doesn't adequately show you meet the requirements, explain what's missing. If you get rejected, don't despair! We're happy to give you advice and pointers on how to improve your portfolio for a future application. Plenty of panelists weren't approved the first time.  If there's a backlog this may take a few days but we will try to get around to everyone as quickly as possible.  **\"I'm an Expert About Something But Never Have a Chance to Write About It!\"**  Some topics only come up once in a blue moon, but that doesn't mean you can't still get flair in it! There are a number of avenues to follow, many of which are dealt with in greater detail at the last section of this thread.  **Expected Behavior**  We invest a large amount of trust in the flaired members of /r/askhistorians, as they represent the subreddit when answering questions, participating in AMAs, and even in their participation across reddit as a whole. As such, we do take into account an applicant's user history reddit-wide when reviewing an application, and will reject applicants whose post history demonstrate bigotry, racism, or sexism. Such behavior is not tolerated in /r/askhistorians, and we do not tolerate it from our panelists in any capacity. We additionally reserve the right to revoke flair based on evidence of such behavior after the application process has been completed. /r/AskHistorians is a safe space for everyone, and those attitudes have no place here.  **Quality Contributors**  If you see an unflaired user consistently giving excellent answers, they can be nominated for a \"Quality Contributor\" flair. Just message the mods their username and some example comments which you believe meet the above criteria.  **FAQ Finder**   To apply for FAQ finder, we require demonstration of a consistent history of community involvement and linking to previous responses and the FAQ. We expect to see potential FAQ Finders be discerning in what they link to, ensuring that it is to threads which represent the current standards of the subreddit, and they do so in a polite and courteous manner, both to the 'Asker', and also by including a username ping of the original 'Answerer'.  **Revoking Flair**  Having a flair brings with it a greater expectation to abide by the subreddit's rules and maintain the high standard of discussion we all like to see here. The mods will revoke the flair of anybody who continually breaks the rules, fails to meet the standard for answers in their area of expertise, or violates the above mentioned expectations. Happily, we almost never have to do this.  **Additional Resources**  Before applying for flair, we encourage you to check out these resources to help you with the application process:  * Our Rules Roundtable on what a 'Good Answer' looks like * Our Wiki Guide on what makes a good application * The Previous Application Threads, to see what makes for successful - and not successful - applications.  * The Sunday Digest, and Monthly Awards which can provide many examples of we are looking for regarding the caliber of flaired users.", "output": "Greetings AH Moderators!

If I want to work for 15 dollars an hour, and the employer I am talking to wants to hire me for that amount, then that makes both me and the employer very happy.

I\u2019m not just talking a little bit, I\u2019m talking if you stood over the toilet with a full glass of water and poured it all out. When that was done, I wiped and was met with a clot the size of almost a golf ball. I\u2019ve never had a period like this before. I have no energy, the blood coming out is not a familiar consistency of periods past, and I\u2019m feeling so nauseous and fatigued.

You are pretty much building bridges here.  If you... process emotions by confronting them, by letting your mind go into freeroam, by adressing the things bothering you.....by getting healthy substitute behaviours to get you off thought spirals and such, this is also why journaling is cool.  Putting stuff on paper confronts and helps processing.  That act in itself fires that circuit for that emotion / trauma... paired with other stimuli.  So if you think about stuff mindfully..why do i think this way.. why am i sad? That too builds those connections.  Since stuff that fires together wires together.. soon enough something which was painful is more manageable.... this is when we processed our emotions.  We built that neuronal bridge.   Sleep is important for this. Also a calm state so pacing, walking, meditation helps immensely...these days we tend to not allow ourselves to get into a state to properly process our emotions it is part of why depression and stress is so high...our brain just goes into thought spirals that are not adressed.  This is also why it is suprisingly helpful to go to a funeral.. you'd think theres just a handful of sad people in the room... but exactly because theres a bunch of people grieving and experiencing loss. That exposure and just bouncing off together helps processing the loss... since we are social beings, just being exposed to others experiences tends to help us out too...even many animals grieve communally...our brain remembers stuff we tie emotions to more.. when you said your goodbyes around all those grieving people.  Your brain sticks that to memory and it will keep sitting there and eventually helps you detatch the sad emotion from your loss.  Due to this thing where our brain builds connections that are common and cuts / makes other things not used weaker...the  brain also has the capability to kinda detach emotions from certain traumatic events.. that traumatic accident or messed up stuff. Will not fade from memory, but given the right processing and method to detatch emotions from the trauma...one can learn to live with it and not absolutely break."}}

I feel that the preference in our tax system for capital gains instead of ordinary income is an unfair susbidy towards the rich, who earn the majority of the capital gains.  I would be ok with only taxing real capital gains (meaning over and above inflation, so if you buy a stock at $100 and sell one year later at $103 and inflation was 3%, you would not have any gain to pay taxes on).  I've seen arguments that treating capital gains differently from earned income encourages investment, but I don't see the need to subsidize investing in the stock market over working or any other thing people choose to do with their money.  Furthermore, treating capital gains differently from income encourages the rich to try to classify their income as capital gains (see carried interest for hedge fund managers).     _____  > *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

But if you say that I can make more money and not have to pay as much tax by investing in the stock market, I'm more likely to give it to a stranger like Elon Musk to try to make cool things for the world.  The other part of it is that capital gains requires long term investments. Short term investments (currently those held for less than a year) are taxed like regular income.

{"item": {"input": "CMV: Charter schools are a blatant attempt to spend less money educating poor minority students. The system works in at least two distinctly different ways:   1. some charters heavily market their product to poor minority students, luring them (and the federal and state money allotted them) away from traditional public schools to schools where the teachers have a significantly smaller total compensation package than their public school counterparts.   2. other charters cater to high-achieving students and lure them (and the money) from their public schools to schools where they can focus on their studies away from the bother of students who can\u2019t achieve because they don\u2019t live in a safe and stable home, don\u2019t have access to technology, don\u2019t have invested parents, don\u2019t have food, etc.   These students would be high achievers wherever they went to school.

{"item": {"input": "CMV: Dating and finding a relationship is easier for the average woman compared to the average man Now, this isn't a post to bash women or how dating is easy for women. It's about how when you compare the experience of the average woman compared to the average man, it's easier for the woman to find dates and a relationship.  Let's start with an example from my personal life. Last year some friend of mine broke up. So far the woman has gone on multiple dates with three different dudes one after the other. Essentially when she decides that she doesn't like one guy she just moves on to the next one in less than a week. While my male friend hasn't had a single date so far and that's not due to a lack of trying. Now even though at the end of the day they are both still single, the women at least go on dates which mean she has a higher chance to find someone compared to the man who hasn't been on a single date.  This brings me to my first point. The average woman has a lot more options compared to the average man. I remember reading a survey that said that on average women are asked about 12 times a year compared to asking less than 1 guy out. And when we introduce online dating it gets even worse. On average a woman has a match rate of 30% while a man has 0.013%. This means that statistically, women have a lot more opportunities to meet the one compared to a man. More options are better than fewer options.  My second point comes down to the average dating strategy. The average woman is a lot more passive than a man, in the man is still the one doing the asking out and trying to impress the woman. This means that women have the option to just passively exist and they just pick and choose from their options. In addition to that, they always have the option of becoming proactive and going after the guys they want if they don't like their options. Compared that to the average guy whose only option is to actively go out looking for women and initiating stuff, since if he just stayed and waited for women to approach he will remain single.

Some relevant SEP pages:  Logical Empiricism (Historically Significant movement): https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-empiricism/  Some key philosophers (movers in analytic philosophy) (roughly chronological):   https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/frege/   https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell/   https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/carnap/   https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/quine/   https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/   (You can find relevant works through references in SEP)   A key topic that has been around them:    https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/analytic-synthetic/   https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/carnap/carnap-quine.html     A lot of those development were also continuous with rise of philosophy of science:   https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/duhem/    https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reichenbach/   https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/neurath/    https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/    https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thomas-kuhn/    https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lakatos/   https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feyerabend/    Some other giants:   https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moore/   https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/davidson/   https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sellars/   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary_Putnam (Couldn't find SEP)   Other Stuff:   https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rigid-designators/    There are plenty more big name and much more contemporary philosophers depending on which specialized domain you want to dig into within analytic philosophy but the above should give you some taste of the history of analytic philosophy and you can decide yourself who interests you most and where to dive. You can always check the bibliography and the SEP for most influential works that are relevant to your interest and done by the philosopher of your interest. For example, for politics, ethics etc. you may have Rawls, Parfit, for phil. of mind, Chalmers, Dennett, Nagel for Phil. of science Cartwright, Van Fraassen etc. (and that's all just a few names off the top of my head; there are many more)"}}
{"item": {"input": "I'm a recent graduate, got in trouble at my internship, could use advice So I'm working as a design engineer at a small company (5 people total work there).  There's this part my boss made that has already started to be manufactured, but a company we're working with on the project wanted to revise it slightly. My boss decided that, even though I'm not on this project and didn't make this part (he did), I should be the one to make the revisions. He forwarded the email to me, which listed 2 revisions that needed to be done: increase a certain diameter and remove a certain hole.  They included a step file of the revised part, and my boss superimposed the revised part on our old part so I could see where changes needed to be made.  I made the proper changes exactly as the email stated. When I looked at the two parts superimposed, I noticed there was still a difference in the parts: this hollow cylinder extruding from the part was conical, and part of it was cut out on theirs and our part was straight with no cuts. When showing my boss the revisions I made exactly as I was instructed, I pointed out this difference and asked if our part needed to have the same cylindrical shape. He said yes, it needed to look like that, and asked me to make that revision as well. I revised the cylinder feature so it looked exactly like the step file that was sent to us. When my boss looked it over again, he got really upset that I changed the inside of the cylinder as well. Apparently, that company that sent us the revision didn't update the inside of their cylinder when they sent us the step file. Like I said, I didn't make this part so I had no way of knowing that the inside of that cylinder hasn't been revised,  It just made sense to me that if the outside was different and I needed to change it, the inside should be changed as well. I've never seen my boss more upset with me, he gave me a hard time for the rest of the day, and at one point I was fighting back tears. I don't know what I could have done differently.

{"item": {"input": "Can you help diagnose me (M25)? 4 Doctors haven't been able to and I'm getting desperate. I'm a 25 year old male (150 lbs, 6') that has had some serious pain in my feet for the last 8 months that's slowly spreading throughout my other joints. I'll do my best to outline the events and time line below:  **May 2022** \\- I woke up one morning and my second toe (next to the big toe) on my right foot was noticeably swollen with mild pain. I hadn't had any injuries or activities that would have caused this but I didn't think much of it.   **June 2022** \\- After a month of swelling, the pain slowly got worse, to the point that it was painful to walk. I went to a pediatrist and he thought it was a torn ligament in that toe. He put me on steroids for a week and saw me again. No improvement was made so he put me on another dose of the same steroid. Just like the first, nothing happened. After the meds, he decided to put me into a boot for a month.   **August 2022** \\- After a month of wearing the boot, I didn't see any improvement and noticed that the swelling was starting to spread to other toes on my right foot. This started to get me worried so I went to another pediatrist who said that it was definitely not a torn ligament. His guess was that it was gout. He did a uric acid blood test, which came back negative but still decided to put me on alopurinol for a few weeks to see if it did anything. After I finished the meds, no improvement had been made and the pain and swelling was getting worse.   **September 2022** \\- By this point I was getting desperate and started to look other places to see if it was caused by something else. I went to an internal medicine doctor that did a full blood panel to see if any of my levels were off. The panel came back completely nonreal, even noting that once again the uric acid levels were normal. He didn't have any suggestions as to what could be causing the foot pain and swelling. By this point, the swelling had spread to all the toes on the right foot and the pain was very prominent around the joint of the big toe and the bottom side of all the toes in the metatarsal area.   **October 2022** \\- By this point, I was starting to have swelling on my big toe on the left foot and was getting sharp pain in my right hip area, deep within the glute, that was making it really difficult to move around. I went to go see an orthopedic surgeon to see if he had any ideas as to what this would be. He said that he had never seen anything like this, and even brought his colleague in to see if they had any ideas. They were both stumped and told me to try stem cell treatment that wasn't covered by insurance. I didn't want to jump into that without getting an actual diagnosis so I wasn't throwing away money.   **December 2022** \\- By this point I'm completly at my wits end trying to figure out what this is and not having any doctors know what it is. The swelling has gotten really bad in the right foot, causing dark colors around all the joints of the toes, especially in the mornings. My right knee has also started to get swollen and has similar pain to the toes, especially when the knee is straightened.  My next step is to see a rheumatologist but they are booked out until February. I'm hoping that one of you have an idea that could help me out.   TLDR: Woke up one morning with a swollen and painful toe. The swelling has spread to all the toes on the right foot and has been extremely painful.

{"item": {"input": "CMV: Liberals should abandon identity politics and instead focus on class/economic issues Identity Politics (IP) is largely unhelpful and extremely divisive. The focus on identity by liberals alienates other people on the left and creates huge distance from those in the middle and those on the right. Class/economic issues, such as wealth inequality and ending crony capitalism, are far more unifying messages for those who hold liberal ideology. Alleviating class/economic issues would also have downstream positive impact on many other issues (often championed by IP) such as racial inequality.  Proponents of IP get caught up too often in the characteristics of the individuals making political arguments \u2013 practically by design. The speaker therefore is weighted according to inherent traits they happened to be born with (race, gender, sexual orientation). This creates an environment in which large portions of the population/electorate (i.e. straight, white, male) feel that their opinions and issues are valued less than others. The resulting atmosphere, exacerbated deliberately by right leaning talking points, causes many to abandon the left.  Class/economic issues should become the leading message for liberals, given the broader appeal it would naturally have. Discussing and championing issues of income distribution/poverty/corruption would reach a much larger population and could pull many in the middle and on the right back toward the left. This would not only be practically useful for political reasons, but would also have a net positive impact on many of the class-related social issues that we see in society.     _____  > *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

I reached out to HR to ask if she is available to meet. I would like to show her the email evidence of how Amy has been replying to me. I have been asking HR about what happens when someone leaves, do they get their vacation time paid in full, etc. I have been so stressed to the point that I want to resign. I don't want HR to talk to my manager or Amy about this, but I guess I wanted to let her know of this issue and to let me know if I might be wrong here. I have shown other people the emails I have received and they too see the attitude. Should I even meet with HR at all or ask if the things I show are confidential?", "output": "Lots of ways to deal with a person like Amy.

So, in country that would loose population it won't do anything to steady state, so in long term there won't be difference.  In country where people are coming we'll see increase of population, but with same equilibrium we can see gradual reversion back to steady state.

{"item": {"input": "Explain like I'm five years old: Why do we feel tired after having to process a lot of information input e.g. a long day of learning new things from lectures?", "output": "Deciding things is called executive function. And you can exhaust it just like you can exhaust any other resource in your body.  I'm not perfectly certain of the exact mechanism but since the transmission of signals between neurons involves the transfer of chemicals your cells probably need to deal with those chemicals and recycle them or retransmit them or something  So anyway it's just this thing where you can sort of use up your brain a little if you use it atypically.  Your body's response to many stresses is to go into a recuperation mode. When you use up resources you get sleepy. You could also get sleepy from being sick. And you get sleepy from physical exercise which is just using up a different set of resources.  So it's not like your brain builds up lactic acid the way your muscles do, but there's probably a very similar mechanism in terms of dealing with all the chemical exchanges that go along with thinking.  So I can't give you the biochemical mechanism directly, but if you look up the term \"exhaustion of executive function in the human brain\" and whatever related terms you can think of, you might find some very interesting reading.  note that this can happen in a very limited way if you just do something like repeat the same word over and over again until it loses meaning. You can literally exhaust that one pathway specifically.  The sensation of sleepiness is just your brain's way of saying that it's had enough of what's been going on and it needs a break. Think of it like a symptom rather than a mechanical result. When you had enough you need sleep."}}

{"item": {"input": "Involved in a multi car accident with fatalities. I want to help all I can but I also want to protect myself. California  Just a warning this is extremely graphic.  Over the weekend, my boyfriend, our friend, and I went on a trip to the coast. We were driving back to Sacramento early in the morning when there was an accident. We were driving through a rural area on a highway, going 65, and it was pitch black. From what I could tell in the dark and at my distance, and with the speed in which things were happening, it looked like two cars collided and debris was all over the road. I braked hard and went to avoid the cars but hit some debris so I pulled over.   When I got out to check my vehicle, I ran back to the scene to see what I hit and discovered a body in the far right lane. I went on auto pilot and called 911. I did my best to explain where we were and what happened. There was another body on the ground a couple lanes away from the first, and a girl screaming and pinned under a car. I stayed with her while bystanders and my passengers did their best to make the scene safer by redirecting traffic.  When police arrived we got together with them and lifted the car off the girl. She had a severe head injury. I stayed with her until the paramedics arrived which was also about when she stopped breathing. I have no idea if she made it, or what her quality of life will be if she did.  After the paramedics took over I broke down and walked back to my car. I cried heavily for a couple of minutes. An officer approached me and my passengers and took our statements. I told them I think I hit someone and they tried to convince me I only hit debris. I was not convinced, and leaned under my car with my phone flash light on and found blood and bits of...flesh or brain, smeared all over my car's belly and hanging down from the heat shields and exhaust system. I was angry with the officer for blowing me off and trying to get us to leave. I had a literal crime scene under my f\\*cking car.  Eventually they decided there were three separate incidents. An officer gave me a card with his badge number and the incident number. He took my insurance information and took pictures of my vehicle, but only took one picture of my vehicle's underside from the front. Remember this was pitch black rural territory with no streetlights. Then he told us that they had everything they needed, that we could go, and to just take my car to a car wash and rinse it off really good, which is absolutely mortifying imo but what else are you supposed to do??  I'm asking if there is anything else I can do. It the daylight you can see better just how much human remains are smeared and hanging off my undercarriage. I doubt the evidence that was collected and I had the thought to have a local CHP officer come out and take additional photos and send them to the officers who responded (we drove straight home from there after that, skipping Sacramento altogether. I don't feel comfortable stating where I live here but I do live in California). I haven't washed my car yet and I would like to do so as soon as possible...I need to get rid of that smell, and I need to have my transmission looked at because it doesn't sound good after what happened.  I just don't know if this could be used against me. I feel like not because of the way the officers were treating the situation, trying to convince me I didn't hit a literal human and trying to get me to leave. Barely taking pictures and all. But I don't know. I just don't know. I'm sorry if I'm asking stupid questions I just want to do everything I possibly and reasonably can. I didn't see what I hit, and if I did, avoiding it could have put myself and my passengers at further risk. The incident was spread across the highway taking up all three lanes and even the shoulders on either side. I just didn't want to collide with the vehicles in the wreckage.  I also want to find out, if legally possible, if there were survivors. One paramedic said the two bodies were gone, but was vague about the girl. I've spoken with my friends, some of whom are medical professionals, about the injury she sustained and the potential for her survival, and no one seems to think that with a head injury like that than anyone could live and if they could, their quality of life wouldn't be great. An article I found online describing the incident states there was one fatality and two taken to the hospital with major injuries, which obviously conflicts with what the paramedic told me. I also want to know if my impact with that passenger killed him, because the article (if it's accurate, who knows) states that the only person who died was the one my vehicle collided with and if the other two people initially survived their ejection, I have reason to believe the man I hit was also alive.  So would it be in my best interest to just rinse off my car and move on with my life, and not try to get more information to the officers? Do they need more information? I feel awful and selfish for asking such a question, but my heart goes out to those people and I want to do everything I can. But I also don't want to have the family members come after me. There's nothing I could have done differently that would have been safer or better. And no amount of evidence or whatever is going to bring that man back to life. Either way, whether he was dead or alive before I hit him, nothing is going to bring him back to life. And I have to live with that.  Also, how can I legally and respectfully find out if the other two people survived? Would it be a bad idea to tell the officers to give my phone number to the family members? I don't know what I would tell them...I don't know. I just don't know how to proceed and I don't want to do something to make things worse.

It is currently 10:38pm as I\u2019m writing this and I haven\u2019t left my bed since 2:30am this morning and that was to let my mum know about the lump.  Today I\u2019ve had no appetite and last time I ate was around 7:30pm yesterday. 20mins ago I got up to use the toilet and as I was making my way out, I collapsed. My body gave out on me so I just laid there for about 10mins until my body gained back conscious. Mind you, my room is directly in front of the bathroom yet I couldn\u2019t even make it past the bathroom door.   I\u2019m not sure if there is a connection but for the past 2/3 weeks my right ear has been really sore but since I always had problems with my ears I ignored it and thought the pain will die down on its own in a week or so but since then I\u2019ve slowly started experiencing migraines straight from hell 24/7. I kid you not, it feels like Mike Tyson is in my head goin HAM. It\u2019s gotten to the point I\u2019m now constantly sleep deprived, lightheaded & nauseous but still I didn\u2019t feel like it was concerning enough to go see the doctor coz I know how busy it is rn and to go in for migraines I didn\u2019t think was fair so thought, \u201cit\u2019s because I\u2019m in bed all day, food will fix it\u201d.   Started having neck pain 6 days ago, did a quick google search and concluded it was poor sleeping posture. Now couple days later and my lips are dry no matter how much water I drink or lip balm I put, they\u2019re constantly dry as well as my throat. Later that night is when I feel a small lump on the right side of my neck in the middle. I thought I was tripping, I could feel something there but convinced myself I\u2019m imagining since it wasn\u2019t visible and brushed it off. Until this morning at 2am, I was trying to massage to help the neck pain and felt really dense and swollen up behind my ear, so I get up to check in the mirror and that when I see how swollen it\u2019s gotten which it wasn\u2019t even noticeable the day before unless I didn\u2019t pay much attention? I feel I would have definitely noticed considering the size. Now like I said I got up about 20mins ago to pee and it\u2019s gotten even bigger and worse in pain and I also just noticed my right ear is bruised.  I know now everything is getting progressively worse quite fast and I should go get it checked but I\u2019m scared it\u2019s more than just swollen lymph node/tumour and the cost considering I\u2019m a permanent resident not a citizen.

{"item": {"input": "CMV: The diversity added into Amazon's Wheel of Time series added nothing, and was a net loss for the show. I want to start by saying that I'm a full hearted supporter of adding diversity into screen adaptations of stories from other media. I consider diversity to be of benefit in its own right. Diversity for its own sake is a positive thing.  That said, the diversity Amazon added to Wheel of Time was a net loss for the story and the show. I'll discuss two examples here: the gender of the potential Dragon Reborn, and the racial diversity of Emond's Field, the Two rivers, and the world writ large. Neither of these additions added more than they detracted from the story, and both were unnecessary. It's been a while since I read the books, so if I miss a detail, let me know. Also, feel free to bring up other examples besides these two.  To start with, gender diversity isn't something lacking in the Wheel of Time. That I can think of now, there are between 6 and 8 main protagonists, depending on where you draw the line; 3 male, and either 3 or 5 female. The rest of the story suffers no shortage of female representation either, the vast majority of the rest of the characters our protagonists interact with are women. The Aes Sedai, by far the most powerful faction of sorts in the world is made up very exclusively of women. A huge percentage of the most important secondary and tertiary characters in the books are from this group, as well as some extremely important female characters we haven't met yet in the show, so I won't discuss them here in the body of the post in order to avoid spoilers. So, when the writers of the show decided to open up the possibility of the Dragon Reborn being a woman, they didn't add a needed element of diversity.  They did, however, muddy a very important detail in the saga of the Dragon Reborn: that the Aes Sedai have been preparing for a Dragon that would not and could not *ever* be one of them. They would never be able to exert direct control of him. For 3000 years the Aes Sedai have planned and plotted and positioned so that when the Dragon Reborn came, they would have the ability to entangle him and create the circumstances they wanted at the end. This also came with the added promise that regardless of who exactly the Dragon Reborn is, their use of the male half of the one power would all but inevitably drive him insane. The debate over how to handle his reemergence was one of the most important and hotly debated topics for millennia. Some thought it would be best to kidnap him, and prevent him from using his abilities until the very end, thus preserving his sanity. Some thought it would be best to try to teach him to resist the insanity, and train him as best they could to harness his strength. While not a huge thing, the hope for the Aes Sedai that they could simply absorb a female Dragon Reborn (as certainly would have been their plan, one which they would have succeeded at) feels like a loss of history and storytelling.   Bigger than that though is the racial diversity the creators foisted upon the Emond's Field and the rest of the world. Like with gender representation, racial representation and diversity isn't in any way missing from the world of Wheel of Time. We visit all parts of the world, and like our own world, each region and country has a predominant race and culture that mirrors those we have here in reality. This is where I might mess some things up, especially given that none of these comparisons are explicitly expressed in the books, but rather easy-to-make inferences based on skin color, culture, and architecture. Tear is largely Arabic, Sheinar is largely southeast Asian, Illian is largely east African, Saldea is largely Persian, Cairhien is largely eastern European, Ghealdon is largely northwest African/Spanish, Andor is largely western European, and the Aiel are largely pre-European colonization North American - albeit with red hair. The list goes on, but I think you get the picture. Of course, very few areas, and especially cities are entirely homogenous, but just like a white person would stick out in Kyoto, a black person would stick out in Amadacia.  The intershuffling of races just wasn't at all necessary, and really took a chunk out of the credibility of one of Moiraine's first important statements, \"The blood of Manetheren runs deep in the Two Rivers.\" The Two Rivers and Especially Emond's Field is *extremely* homogenous. It's a town of only a couple hundred people, and virtually no one ever leaves or moves there. Some people living outside of Emond's Field in the Two Rivers don't even know it exists. How am I supposed to believe that all of the inhabitants of Emond's Field are directly descended from Manetheren when they're all of clearly divergent ancestry? If the creators wanted to say that Manetheren was itself diverse, make everyone in Emond's Field mixed race. Not a difficult solution, and far better for the world building. If you're worried that doing so would make all the protagonists look more or less the same, don't.  More important though, is that for a show that will jump back and forth across the world constantly, diversifying every country on the map makes it a lot harder for the audience to know where the hell the scene on screen is taking place. They have a *ton* of ground to cover, both figuratively and literally, in telling even the very watered down version they plan to. Every second counts, and the characters all move around a lot, but now we'll either lose time to wide angle shots of each location every time, or simply won't know where we are half the time.  Please use the spoiler button if you want to talk specifics that haven't yet been covered in the show.", "output": "Two things. Two and a half, I guess.  One, making it a mystery who the dragon reborn could be is a very easy way to set up Nynaeve and Egwen as extremely powerful. You might've noticed that the show has a much, *much* faster pace - they need to get on with it. Perrin very obviously isn't the Dragon Reborn, since he already displays other powers. Mat was ruled out when he was cured by Moiraine. But to keep it more exciting, the option was left open - and since the whole plot about the Aes Sedai scheming for the dragon reborn isn't in the show that also isn't an issue.  Two, the Two Rivers being predominantly non white makes Rand stick out like a sore thumb, which in my opinion is great. He's a very obvious outsider. In the books, his only defining feature that sets him apart is his red hair, but that is barely noticeable on screen (as in, not something anyone will pay attention to). This was probably not the reason they went with this decision, but it doesn't detract from the believability.  Two point five, the people of the Two Rivers don't have names that fit into Andor *at all*. Andor is largely based on England - with names taken directly or indirectly from the Le Morte D'Arthur, for example. Someone named \"Al'Vere\", I think it was, doesn't fit into that at all anyway."}}

{"item": {"input": "CMV: The Rayshard Brooks shooting was a tragic loss of human life but mostly justified by his actions. Ok, I almost guarantee this has been posted on here before but after I skimmed the \u201cnew\u201d section for a few minutes I didn\u2019t see it so I figured sure why not.   I\u2019m gonna start this by saying I completely stand behind BLM and the peaceful protests across America and the world in their fight for equal rights and just protection under the law. I think there are many instances of police brutality and blatant homicide by LEO but this is not a very good example. Im just gonna break it down from my POV to start. the confrontation started with them politely asking a man to move his car out of the drive through because it was in the way of everyone else. After he failed a sobriety test, clearly showing he was drunk, they did what they\u2019re taught to do and calmly tell him he\u2019s under arrest and that he needs to come with them. As they surround him to put him in handcuffs, not showing any kind of aggression or hostility that is common among LEO, he tries to shake both of them off.   He proceeds to physically engage both officers, punching them and throwing them off him, they discharge their tasers but he seems relatively unaffected. He then steals one and manages to get by both officers, running away. He points the taser at the officer chasing him and the officer shoots him to stop him.   It\u2019s tragic, no doubt, and to be fair I\u2019m not even trying to defend the officer, he deserves some reprimand for his actions but he shouldn\u2019t be charged with multiple, serious offenses leading to many years of jail time. I think yes, the situation could\u2019ve been handled much better, and he should be fired for his hasty actions but I think there is a place where we need to draw the line.   In my eyes, the officer, highly trained and armed, is taught to stop the criminal no matter what, in his eyes, this man just drove drunk, assaulted two officers, stole a taser, and attempted to discharge the weapon on another officer. A weapon that has been described by the state as potentially deadly and which, he has been told to take as a direct threat. I don\u2019t think this is not so much on the officer rather the system and the state.   I\u2019m not trying to discredit the protests or their fight, nor even this mans life. I completely respect all of those, but I mean, what was he supposed to do? He didn\u2019t have a secondary weapon, he wasn\u2019t likely to catch him on foot, I think, again, it\u2019s excessive, and he should be fired, but his alternatives was to watch a criminal run away with a \u201clethal\u201d weapon. You can even hear him on the video trying to say things to brooks like \u201cstay with me\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t stop breathing\u201d so I definitely don\u2019t think it\u2019s a lack of moral or humanity on the part of the officer.   Tbh I\u2019ve had it explained so many different ways, I\u2019m not even sure what to think rn, but this is the best way I think I can put it from my view. Feel free to completely discredit me, I welcome any and all criticism, if with some hesitation, as that\u2019s how we grow as people. Thank you for attending my TED talk.", "output": "Police should only kill someone when there is no other choice: self defense, save a life, etc  just like any civilian.   Police expose themselves more so are likely to run into these situations more.   They killed someone for resisting arrest.  This is criminal.   The taser is not more deadly than a club or a knee in the neck, if you think it is deadly it should be banned, it's more of a torture device.   You say that he was drunk and about to drive so could have killed someone.  If DUI is now a death penalty crime then we are all in trouble."}}

Consultancy while they get to boss the contractor and sub-contractor around they are unfortunately the first one to be slapped by the client, I know many who'll lose their job on the tiniest mistake so i don't recommend going into it.  The main contractor needs to meet deadlines which could lead to insane hours of work and finally mep subcontracting is the least headache because you just comply with whoever is paying you and call it a day but the pay is the worst."}}

My company is very flexible when it comes to hours worked, but of course us salaried employees have to get at least 40 hours.  Part of my performance evaluation a while ago, my boss indirectly told me that I should be working more than 40 hours. Now I don't think he's a bad boss, but I think I'm being unfairly compared to the senior engineers that regularly work 50-60 hours every week. This being my first job out of college, I didn't want to argue with him about it.   But the whole time we were having that conversation, I was thinking what the hell. Is 40 hours not enough these days? I'm a young, fairly inexperienced EIT. This means I don't have a ton of responsibilities, i.e. managing projects or leading the design teams on huge projects.

If nothing was done after Sandy Hook when Democrats were in power, I'm not sure why you think protesting is going to bring chance while Republicans are in power.  What *could* have a significant impact, especially at your particular school, is to reach out to the guy who is going to be shooting up the school and include him in your life.  Whenever a school shooting occurs, the students are rarely surprised at who the shooter is.

He was originally a foster who had \u201cpneumonia\u201d but when he wasn\u2019t improving I adopted him so I could take over his medical care.   After seeing 4 vets, including specialists, multiple xrays, blood work, and cardiology appointments, it was determined that he has an entire host of congenital defects. His lungs completely lack blood flow in the front, his heart has a bad valve, he has bone marrow issues, and kidney issues.   The thing is, he behaves like he\u2019s perfectly fine. He plays and runs and jumps and purrs. He\u2019s adorable and full of fun. The vet said he behaves this way because his defects are all he\u2019s ever known so he is used to feeling bad. But the vet also said that as he grows, his body will struggle more and that he is a ticking time bomb for catastrophic health failure and that he likely wouldn\u2019t die instantly but suffer before we could get him to the vet. She said it\u2019s not if but when and could happen anytime.  I love him so much. I don\u2019t want to euthanize him. But he is becoming sexually mature and we can\u2019t neuter him because he wouldn\u2019t survive anesthesia. He\u2019s starting to get pissy to our other cats. But also, I\u2019m constantly afraid for him, I dread the moment that he begins to suffer and hurt. Every time he is out of my sight I wonder if he\u2019s in a corner gasping for air.  Some people in my life have said I should wait to euthanize until he is suffering. The vet said with all of his issues it is appropriate to euthanize at any point, and this has been confirmed by 4 other vets. My thinking is that I\u2019d rather his last day be a happy day and not one where he is in agony. I am considering calling the mobile vet to come to our house to euthanize in the next week or so.  I\u2019m literally gutted by this. I don\u2019t know what plan is right. He can\u2019t survive his issues and they can\u2019t be treated.

It functions as the theoretical basis for Marxist theory (whereas the practical basis is being a communist). A good example of the application of dialectical materialism is historical materialism (which is arguably much easier to understand). Also worth noting that the term 'dialectical materialism' itself wasn't coined until Kautsky after Marx and Engels' death.  I don't know if you are adverse to quotes, given your final parenthesis, but I would find them the complete opposite of 'hindering' to your comprehension of the concept:  \"It is an eternal cycle in which matter moves, a cycle that certainly only completes its orbit in periods of time for which our terrestrial year is no adequate measure, a cycle in which the time of highest development, the time of organic life and still more that of the life of being conscious of nature and of themselves, is just as narrowly restricted as the space in which life and self-consciousness come into operation. A cycle in which every finite mode of existence of matter, whether it be sun or nebular vapour, single animal or genus of animals, chemical combination or dissociation, is equally transient, and wherein nothing is eternal but eternally changing, eternally moving matter and the laws according to which it moves and changes.\" (Engels, Dialectics of Nature, https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1883/don/ch01.htm)    \"Motion is the mode of existence of matter. Never anywhere has there been matter without motion, or motion without matter, nor can there be.\"  \"Change of form of motion is always a process that takes place between at least two bodies, of which one loses a definite quantity of motion of one quality (e.g. heat), while the other gains a corresponding quantity of motion of another quality (mechanical motion, electricity, chemical decomposition).  \"Dialectics, so-called objective dialectics, prevails throughout nature, and so-called subjective dialectics (dialectical thought), is only the reflection of the motion through opposites which asserts itself everywhere in nature, and which by the continual conflict of the opposites and their final passage into one another, or into higher forms, determines the life of nature.\" (same source as above)  \"But dialectical materialism insists on the approximate relative character of every scientific theory of the structure of matter and its properties; it insists on the absence of absolute boundaries in nature, on the transformation of moving matter from one state into another, that from our point of view [may be] apparently irreconcilable with it, and so forth.\" (Lenin, Materialism and Empirico-Criticism, https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1908/mec/05.htm)    \"With each epoch-making discovery even in the sphere of natural science, materialism has to change its form; and after history was also subjected to materialistic treatment, a new avenue of development has opened here, too.   For dialectical philosophy nothing is final, absolute, sacred. It reveals the transitory character of everything and in everything; nothing can endure before it except the uninterrupted process of becoming and of passing away, of endless ascendancy from the lower to the higher.\" (Engels, The End of Classical German Philosophy, https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1886/ludwig-feuerbach/index.htm)  If this was not the type of answer you were looking for, please do tell.

They told me they were looking for someone with a name I hadn\u2019t ever heard. I don\u2019t know this person and have never seen them a day in my life. I then asked them to show me a picture and again told them I don\u2019t know who tf that is and he doesn\u2019t live here! They told me that they\u2019re coming in regardless of whether I want them to so we can \u201cdo this the easy way or the hard way\u201d. This whole situation was so random and bizarre it\u2019s 1am and I still can\u2019t get past what happened today still has me panicking with anxiety. I have glass in my foot making it hard to walk since I have to limp and just the sheer terror of initially thinking it was a burglar. They all treated me as if I were lying and hiding a boyfriend or something. They kept trying to trip me up in a \u201clie\u201d and I was so confused while they were using dumb police interrogation tactics.  Only me and my 10 year old child live here and they broke his bedroom window which was near my head when I fell asleep in his room but thankfully no cuts in my face. Just my foot and almost my cats paws. As they\u2019re storming my apartment shouting for \u201cLarry so and so\u201d they\u2019re asking me where my child is what his name is what his dads name is and his dads address and all kinds of crazy sh*t!

I offered to show them my lease, my USPS informed delivery to show this person gets no mail here and I told them there are cameras where they can easily see he has never been here and isn\u2019t inside. They didn\u2019t identify themselves to me even know I kept referring to them as police since I thought they were but they finally said \u201cwe\u2019re not police\u201d but nothing else. I didn\u2019t know they were bounty hunters until someone told me they were after the fact. I wasn\u2019t given the ability to look at the arrest warrant either to even verify that the address is my address. I looked up the persons info who they\u2019re looking for and it shows an address in another city that an apt building but it shows 5 different apt #\u2019s under his list of previous residences which leads me to believe he lived at both complexes and gave all those random unit #\u2019s out to obviously conceal his real address since he likes to go on the run and not show up to court. They also lied and said that they broke 1 window pane and failed to mention that they broke both but also bent up the screen. They also lied and said that they provided their info yet I don\u2019t know any of their names or what bail company they are so I have no idea how to get my address removed! Otherwise it\u2019ll be an endless cycle of them storming my home looking for a whole stranger. They said that they\u2019re paying for the window so obviously they know they weren\u2019t within their right otherwise they wouldn\u2019t be paying for it. This is criminal to me though because how can they break through my window for someone they have never seen here? They didn\u2019t hear any voices either because I was asleep. I didn\u2019t have the TV on either. Now I\u2019m left with my window still open at 1 in the morning because maintenance at my Apts never showed up and I can\u2019t get this glass out of my foot. Sorry this was long and maybe kind of ranty but thank you for reading all the way through and enlightening me on the law regarding this.

{"item": {"input": "Dumb question about car engineering - could you use a flywheel to 'store' energy from the engine, for later use to help accelerate faster? I'm not talking about regenerative braking.  RB uses the brakes to spin up a flywheel.  I'm talking about using an engine to spin up a flywheel.  ---  I was watching some car modding videos today when a thought struck me.  No, I'm not interested in doing this myself.  I'm not even a car guy.  More than anything, I'm wondering why this *isn't* done in racing situations.  I imagine the answer is that it would be too heavy to provide any benefit.  Suppose you're designing a racing car.  The car will be racing in a race where there are periods during which it's *not* accelerating.   - For example - a drag race, where a car sits for *minutes* doing nothing at the starting line, before having to rapidly accelerate.  - For example - a rally, where there are periods when a car's engine has the *capacity* to accelerate more but the driver momentarily wishes to keep the car slower for more control; followed by other periods where the driver wishes to accelerate faster than the engine can allow.  Now suppose you connect the car's engine to a flywheel as well as the car's wheels.  The engine can send the entirety of its power to the wheels by temporarily disconnecting the flywheel.  Somehow, it can also power the wheels a little bit while also spinning up the flywheel.  When the driver requires it, the flywheel can be connected to the wheels, relieving it of its own momentum to spin up the wheels even more.     - On a race's starting line, a driver would use the car's engine to spin up the flywheel.  The moment the lights go green, the driver steps on the gas.  The car's computer connects the engine and the flywheel to the wheels.  The momentum stored in the flywheel allows the car to accelerate much faster than a normal car, whose wheels can only be driven by the engine alone.  - During a period of a rally race where the driver needs to control their speed, the engine might rev up faster than it normally would, for the speed the car's travelling at.  The extra power is sent to the flywheel to spin it up.  The momentum of the flywheel could be used later to help the car accelerate faster when necessary.  This would be similar to regenerative braking, except instead of using the brakes to power the flywheel the engine itself would be used to power the flywheel.    My questions are:   - Is this possible, or is it really dumb?  - Why aren't these systems used in real life?  Is it due to the engineering complexity?  Due to the mass of the flywheel?  - Are there any other places it could be used?  (For example - perhaps it's too heavy for a racing car, but could be useful in a tank.)", "output": "https://www.hybridcars.com/flywheel-hybrids/"}}
{"item": {"input": "Where are the actual engineering jobs? I'm an EE with 7years experience and am stuck in my career, any advice would be appreciated.  **TLDR**: Are there jobs that involve challenging EE work instead of the bureaucratic nightmare that I'm currently trapped in? and how do I find them?  **Background**: I left my previous company after a year of doing near zero engineering work, in my new company I'm finding myself in the same situation.   **Experiences**: In my first job out of college I was writing firmware, designing 12-layer PCBs, troubleshooting at the component level, all my time was spent reading datasheets, it was great, but the pay was terrible and nowhere else to go within the company, so I moved on.  Since leaving that position, both companies I have been with since have had great pay, but the engineering work and internal bureaucracies are a joke.  Both job descriptions listed out the kinds of things I wanted to do, but I'm doing none of those.  From what I can see, any engineering work that does happen is completely hamstrung by mismanagement and internal bureaucracy.  I spend my time waiting for work and attending meetings where no one can determine an owner for otherwise very (VERY) simple problems that drag on for months.  I'm bored, not learning anything, and frustrated by the inefficiency.    **Example**: We need a very basic PDU to upgrade a station.  I spec'd out the PDU (real straight forward).  I'm now a dozen meetings and two months in and I'm still giving presentations on it, not about technical requirements (no one wants to hear those) but because I need to explain that there is an old PDU, and due to internal standards, we need a new one.  I did this at my previous job, and I'm doing it again at my current one, I'm losing my mind.  **Current Outlook**:  I realize that I'm new to the company, not going to get the fun projects right away, but I am in the meetings where they are discussed.  The work is spread out over a committee people who'd rather spend more time shrugging their shoulders than having any technical discussion.  Any mention of this to management has been met with enigmatic \"work is coming\" with no elaboration or plans to prepare for that work.  **Future plans**: I don't want to make a habit of jumping jobs, that's no good for a resume, but I can't deal with the boredom, and feeling my skills languish from lack of use is killing me.   How do I find a job with challenging technical problems and the agency to solve them?  I'm considering going back to school, but haven't determined if that will help.  I'm also considering a career change, probably to software, or frankly, literally anything else.  Conclusion: How do I find a job with actual technical problems? or is my experience in the EE field just how it is?", "output": "Find a smaller company."}}

{"item": {"input": "YOU Can Help to Answer Questions \u2022 The /r/AskHistorians Flair Application Thread XXI! Welcome flair applicants! This is the place to apply for a flair \u2013 the colored text you will have seen next to some user's names indicating their specialization. We are always looking for new flaired users, and if you think you have what it takes to join the panel of historians, you're in the right place!  For examples of previous applications, and our current panel of historians, you can find the previous application thread here, and there is a list of active flaired users](/r/AskHistorians/wiki/flairedusers) on our wiki.  **[Requirements for a flair**  A flair in /r/AskHistorians indicates extensive, in-depth knowledge about an area of history *and* a proven track record of providing great answers in the subreddit. In applying for a flair, you are claiming to have:  * **Expertise in an area of history**, typically from either degree-level academic experience or an equivalent amount of self-study. For more exploration of this, check out this thread.  * The ability to **cite sources** from specialist literature for any claims you make within your area.  * The ability to provide **high quality answers** in the subreddit in accordance with our rules.    For a more in-depth look at how applications are analyzed, consult this helpful guide on our wiki explaining what an answer that demonstrates the above looks like.  **How to apply**  To apply for a flair, simply post in this thread. Your post needs to include:  * Links to **3-5 comments** in /r/AskHistorians that show you meet the above requirements, and of which at least three were posted in the last six months. Answers linked in an application should go 'above and beyond' the base requirements of the rules here, and reflect the depth of your expertise.  * The **text of your flair** and which category it belongs in (see the sidebar). Be as specific as possible as we prefer flair to reflect the exact area of your expertise as near as possible, but be aware there is a limit of 64 characters.  One of the moderators will then either confirm your flair or, if the application doesn't adequately show you meet the requirements, explain what's missing. If you get rejected, don't despair! We're happy to give you advice and pointers on how to improve your portfolio for a future application. Plenty of panelists weren't approved the first time.  If there's a backlog this may take a few days but we will try to get around to everyone as quickly as possible.  **\"I'm an Expert About Something But Never Have a Chance to Write About It!\"**  Some topics only come up once in a blue moon, but that doesn't mean you can't still get flair in it! There are a number of avenues to follow, many of which are dealt with in greater detail at the last section of this thread.  **Expected Behavior**  We invest a large amount of trust in the flaired members of /r/askhistorians, as they represent the subreddit when answering questions, participating in AMAs, and even in their participation across reddit as a whole. As such, we do take into account an applicant's user history reddit-wide when reviewing an application, and will reject applicants whose post history demonstrate bigotry, racism, or sexism. Such behavior is not tolerated in /r/askhistorians, and we do not tolerate it from our panelists in any capacity. We additionally reserve the right to revoke flair based on evidence of such behavior after the application process has been completed. /r/AskHistorians is a safe space for everyone, and those attitudes have no place here.  **Quality Contributors**  If you see an unflaired user consistently giving excellent answers, they can be nominated for a \"Quality Contributor\" flair. Just message the mods their username and some example comments which you believe meet the above criteria.  **FAQ Finder**   To apply for FAQ finder, we require demonstration of a consistent history of community involvement and linking to previous responses and the FAQ. We expect to see potential FAQ Finders be discerning in what they link to, ensuring that it is to threads which represent the current standards of the subreddit, and they do so in a polite and courteous manner, both to the 'Asker', and also by including a username ping of the original 'Answerer'.  **Revoking Flair**  Having a flair brings with it a greater expectation to abide by the subreddit's rules and maintain the high standard of discussion we all like to see here. The mods will revoke the flair of anybody who continually breaks the rules, fails to meet the standard for answers in their area of expertise, or violates the above mentioned expectations. Happily, we almost never have to do this.  **Additional Resources**  Before applying for flair, we encourage you to check out these resources to help you with the application process:  * Our Rules Roundtable on 'Expertise' and the Flair Application Process * Our Wiki Guide on what makes a good application * The Previous Application Threads, to see what makes for successful - and not successful - applications.  * The Sunday Digest, and Monthly Awards which can provide many examples of we are looking for regarding the caliber of flaired users.", "output": "Hi, I would like to apply for a flair for \"American Political History (Founding Era).\" This would fall under the category of \"North American History,\" I believe.

{"item": {"input": "What is it like to leave academia? I get the sense that most of this sub is geared toward university PhD professors/post-docs/grad students so I am in a little bit of a different position but I think a lot of the same values, positives, and negatives of academia apply so I am looking for any thoughts from similarly  academically-minded people.  &#x200B;  I am currently finishing my medical residency (rough equivalent of post-doc). Like many of you, I have been in academia my whole life and been rewarded so far with opportunities, praise, respect, grants, etc. But I am at a career crossroads now that I have to get my first \"real\" job. The two jobs are probably more similar than they are different in the grand scheme of things given that my main role will be seeing patients either way. The main differences are the environment, autonomy, and pay.   &#x200B;  The two jobs:  \\--Academic job: 20-30% research time, 70% seeing patients, teaching, and administrative duties. Somewhat more flexible lifestyle due to culture and slower pace (45-50 hours/week). Pay starts at 300k/year and may rise slowly over the next 10-15 years. I am lukewarm about my research but could continue it. The main benefit is getting to stay in an intellectually engaging environment at a top institution for my field, and one where I am comfortable having been in the academic environment for almost 20 years.   \\--Private job: 100% seeing patients every day, can be a bit of a grind (55-60 hours/week). Pay starts higher (maybe 400-450k/year) and will rise quickly for 2 years to 600-800k/year, and then slowly rise after that as I get more efficient over time and/or with inflation.  Main benefit is the money, lack of having research projects hang over my head (and having to bring work home with me). Possible downsides are missing the intellectual side of academia and the longer-term outlook that comes with research (i.e. every day/week/month is going to be the same in broad strokes, I'll be doing the same thing in August 2030 as I am in August 2020).   &#x200B;  Has anyone on this sub left academia after years of being in academia and succeeding at it? I feel like I may be throwing away an opportunity that so many want and so few get.", "output": "not from the medical field, but i recently left academia after 7 years in the field of higher education admin, and let me tell you - it has been the best decision of my life.  i make more money.  i work less hours.  the work i do feels more appreciated (from clients and employers).  there is less politic-ing my way through the work day.  moving up in my company actually seems possible.  my suggestion is to do it.  even if it's \"harder\" at first - i've never had to pay rent before in my life (i'm 25) - it will be worth it in the long haul."}}
