What is being transfused  \n   \u2022 Plasma is the cell\u2011free part of blood, so it contains antibodies (mainly IgG, some IgM/IgA), complement proteins, clotting factors and other soluble molecules\u2014but no B\u2011cells, T\u2011cells or other white cells that could go on making antibody.  \n\n2. What those antibodies do after infusion  \n   \u2022 Immediately circulate and bind the virus or virus\u2011infected cells.  \n   \u2022 Neutralise the virus (block its entry into new cells).  \n   \u2022 Opsonise the virus, making it easier for the patient\u2019s phagocytes to engulf it.  \n   \u2022 Activate complement or mediate antibody\u2011dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).\n\n   All of this is a direct, \u201cready\u2011made\u201d attack by the donor antibodies. They start working within minutes to hours, and their activity lasts only as long as the antibodies remain in the patient\u2019s body (IgG half\u2011life \u2248 21\u00a0days).\n\n3. Does the recipient then make more of the same antibody?  \n   \u2022 No. Antibodies are not blueprints that the immune system can copy.  \n   \u2022 A person\u2019s B\u2011cells are \u201cprogrammed\u201d by exposure to antigen, not by exposure to someone else\u2019s antibody. Because the transfused plasma contains virtually no B\u2011cells, there is nothing in it that can seed new antibody production.  \n   \u2022 The patient may still develop (or continue to develop) their own antibody response to the virus because they are infected and are seeing viral antigens, but that response is independent of the transfused antibodies.\n\n4. Indirect help to the patient\u2019s own immune response  \n   \u2022 By lowering the amount of free virus, the donor antibodies can give the patient\u2019s immune system time to catch up and mount its own response.  \n   \u2022 Immune complexes formed by donor antibodies bound to virus can enhance antigen presentation, which may slightly boost the patient\u2019s own antibody production.  \n   \u2022 Nevertheless, any antibodies the patient eventually produces are generated de novo by their own B\u2011cells; they are not \u201ccopies\u201d expanded from the transfused antibodies.\n\n5. Duration and comparison with a vaccine  \n   \u2022 Passive immunity: immediate but temporary; no immunological memory.  \n   \u2022 Active immunity (vaccine or surviving the infection): slower to appear but long\u2011lasting and memory\u2011forming.\n\nSo, in short, the therapeutic benefit of convalescent plasma comes almost entirely from the donor antibodies acting directly against the virus. The patient\u2019s body does not \u201clearn\u201d from those antibodies or manufacture more of them; it must still mount its own immune response to gain lasting protection."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant. answer the queries"}, {"role": "user", "content": "CMV: NFTs are digital garbage whose popularity is fueled by greedy speculation. We\u2019ve seen this before\u2026 Hummel figurines, beanie babies, Thomas Kinkade \u2018collectibles\u2019. People will compete to spend money on tokens purely out of speculation under the misguided belief that \u201cThese are gonna be worth something someday.\u201d With NFTs, I don\u2019t believe there is any true value to them and as a medium, I do not believe they will have lasting artistic significance.   My current take is that NFTs are an offshoot of what I\u2019ll deem \u201cThe Blockchain Bubble\u201d. When I googled \u201cWhat makes an NFT valuable?\u201d I got this: \u201cFactors that make NFTs such a valuable investment are utility, ownership history, underlying value, perception of the buyer, liquidity premium and future value\u201d  All of this is subjective with a heavy profit motive, but the profit hinges on speculation not retailing or commodities.   People compare owning an NFT to owning an original painting or the Masters of a recording. The problem with this is - those products can be commoditized while an NFT can not.   Moreover, NFTs are not competitive in the digital ecosystem - there are literally BILLIONS of drawings paintings pictures songs and depictions that are free, all over the internet. They aren\u2019t scarce or limited - so why would I want to pay for something when I can obtain it for free?   We are in the middle of a hype-cycle and humans flock towards the next shiny thing like magpies\u2026 but I concede there may be more to this than I realize. Maybe there is something about NFTs that is valuable\u2026 change my view!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I agree with you that 2021\u201322 was a textbook asset\u2011bubble and that most of the pictures sold as \u201cNFT art\u201d will never recover the prices people paid for them.  \nBut the fact that a first wave of use\u2011cases was dominated by FOMO and greed does not imply that the technical primitive itself is pointless.  Below are a few angles that tend to survive careful scrutiny, even once you strip away the hype.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Digital scarcity can create real economic value\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 Scarcity already exists for purely digital objects that are easy to copy: Internet domain names, Twitter / Instagram handles, Steam game skins, airline miles, World of Warcraft gold, etc.  Technically anyone can copy the string \u201cgoogle.com\u201d, but only one wallet can hold the actual DNS registration.  That exclusivity is why the name is valuable.\n\n\u2022 An NFT is nothing more than a registry entry on a public database (a blockchain) that says \u201cwallet X controls identifier Y\u201d.  If the underlying identifier has utility, the market will price it as such, exactly as with domain names.\n\n\u2022 The NFT standard is open and permissionless, so rather than hundreds of fragmented, proprietary registries\u2014each controlled by one company\u2014you get a single, composable ledger.  This greatly lowers switching costs and increases liquidity (easier to buy, sell, collateralize, borrow against, etc.).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n2. Authenticity and provenance for digital media\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 Before NFTs, the only way to tell whether a .jpg really came from Beeple, Pak, or the NBA was to trust a centralized site (Dropbox, NBA.com, etc.) or to rely on watermarks that could be forged.  \n  \u2013 With NFTs, Beeple can upload a hash of the file that\u2019s permanently tied to his public key.  Anyone can now cryptographically verify: \u201cYes, this object originated from Beeple.\u201d  Museums and auction houses already do this for physical art; NFTs are simply the first generally\u2011workable solution for natively digital work.\n\n\u2022 Royalties.  You can debate whether 5\u201310\u00a0% \u201ccreator royalties\u201d should be enforceable forever, but the technical fact is that NFTs made it trivial for artists to code resale royalties into the asset itself.  That\u2019s a genuine improvement over the legacy art market, where the original artist usually earns $0 when a painting flips for $10\u00a0M years later.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n3. Composability unlocks new business models\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nBecause all NFTs live on the same open ledger, any developer can write software that recognizes or extends any other NFT without asking permission.\n\n\u2022 Tickets and memberships  \n  \u2013 Coachella, UEFA and several major U.S. sports teams have already piloted NFTs as tickets.  They eliminate counterfeiting, can automatically split resale fees between the team and the performer, and double as perpetual \u201cproof\u2011of\u2011attendance\u201d collectibles.  \n  \u2013 Bored Ape Yacht Club holders got access to private Discords, merch drops, ApeFest concerts, and even an IP license to use the Ape in commercial products.  Strip away the monkey pictures; what remains is simply a transferable membership credential that any third\u2011party business can recognize.\n\n\u2022 In\u2011game items  \n  \u2013 Counter\u2011Strike skins and Fortnite dances already trade for thousands of dollars, but they\u2019re locked to Valve/Epic servers.  NFTs let the *player* hold the key.  If the studio shuts down, the asset can still live on and appear in new games because the data is open.\n\n\u2022 Decentralized finance (DeFi)  \n  \u2013 People are already borrowing stablecoins against high\u2011end NFTs (Art Blocks, Punks) the same way you would borrow against a piece of real estate.  Whether you personally want to do that is beside the point; the fact that it\u2019s possible\u2014with no bank, broker or lawyer\u2014is new.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n4. \u201cBut anyone can right\u2011click\u2013save\u2026\u201d\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nOwning the bytes and owning the *claim* are different things\u2014exactly the same distinction that makes the PDF of the Mona Lisa worthless while the original under glass at the Louvre is invaluable.\n\n\u2022 Social signaling.  A Lamborghini can be replicated in a video game, but people still pay for the real one because the *certificate of authenticity* matters.  In online environments (Twitter profile pics, metaverse spaces, etc.) an NFT\u2019s blockchain receipt is that certificate.\n\n\u2022 Legal rights.  In several jurisdictions, the NFT itself is now accepted evidence in court for IP licensing or chain\u2011of\u2011title disputes.  Prada, LVMH and Cartier co\u2011founded the \u201cAura\u201d consortium to mint NFTs that prove the authenticity of their handbags and watches.  That is, literally, anti\u2011counterfeiting infrastructure.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n5. Environmental & scalability criticisms are not fatal\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 Most new NFT volume has moved from proof\u2011of\u2011work chains (Ethereum 1.0) to proof\u2011of\u2011stake chains (Ethereum 2.0, Solana, Tezos, Polygon).  The Merge cut Ethereum\u2019s energy use by ~99.95\u00a0%.  Minting an NFT on modern chains has a smaller carbon footprint than sending two emails with large attachments.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n6. Historical precedent: bubbles \u2260 useless\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 Railroads (1840s), radio (1920s), dot\u2011coms (1990s) and smartphones (2000s) each had speculative manias, followed by crashes, followed by durable, transformative businesses.  Pets.com went to zero, but Amazon, eBay and PayPal emerged from the same frenzy.\n\n\u2022 Beanie Babies are a closer analogy to a single brand of collectible than to an open, general\u2011purpose data primitive.  A better analogy for NFTs is TCP/IP or the DNS standard.  Most early dot\u2011com domain names were registered purely to flip, yet the DNS system clearly has lasting utility.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n7. What an NFT is *not*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 It is not the image or song itself (unless the file is fully on\u2011chain; most aren\u2019t).  \n\u2022 It is not a promise of future price appreciation (that\u2019s just speculation).  \n\u2022 It is not, by itself, a shortcut to mass adoption; just like email was useless until enough people had email addresses, many NFT use\u2011cases require critical mass.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nConclusion\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nYour skepticism about short\u2011term price mania is spot\u2011on.  Roughly 95\u00a0% of the JPEG\u2011flipping market will die off, and thousands of bands, athletes and brands are indeed slapping \u201cNFT\u201d on junk just to make a quick buck.\n\nWhat *survives* will be the underlying primitive: a globally readable, permissionless ledger for unique digital objects.  That primitive already:\n\n\u2022 solves authenticity and provenance for digital media,  \n\u2022 enables transferable, programmable memberships and tickets,  \n\u2022 gives players true ownership of in\u2011game items,  \n\u2022 lets creators bake royalties and licensing rules directly into the asset, and  \n\u2022 creates a composable base layer on which any developer can build without asking permission.\n\nNone of those functions depend on tulip\u2011like price charts\u2014which is why, even after this bubble deflates, NFTs (or whatever we call the standard in five years) are likely to keep turning up in products you use.\n\nYou may still feel that *owning* a PFP\u2011monkey is silly; that\u2019s a matter of personal taste.  But the mechanism that makes that monkey provably scarce and interoperable is the same mechanism that\u2019s already improving ticketing, fashion anti\u2011counterfeiting, generative art, and digital identity.  Dismissing the entire concept as \u201cdigital garbage\u201d risks throwing out a genuinely useful protocol with the bath\u2011water of speculation."}]}

Suppose someone claims that a unicorn exists, and there is no evidence for or against the existence of a unicorn, what should a rational thinker do in such scenario?  Should one suspend judgment? Or should one reason that the claim is more likely to be false since it is a better explanation in terms of simplicity?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. The three doxastic options  \nWhenever you meet a proposition p (\u201cUnicorns exist\u201d) you have only three possible epistemic attitudes toward it.  \nA. Believe p (accept it as true)  \nB. Disbelieve p (accept \u00acp, i.e. that unicorns do not exist)  \nC. Suspend judgment (withhold belief both ways)\n\nThe rational attitude is the one that is best supported by your total evidence.  \n\n2. No evidence \u21d2 no positive justification  \nIf literally nothing counts for or against p, believing p would violate the classical evidentialist maxim (Locke, Hume, Clifford): \u201cProportion belief to the evidence.\u201d There is nothing to proportion a positive belief to, so option\u00a0A is ruled out.\n\n3. Should we then disbelieve or suspend?  \n\na) Pure agnosticism:  \nIf you interpret \u201cno evidence\u201d very strictly\u2014no background knowledge whatsoever that bears on the issue\u2014then neither p nor \u00acp is evidentially favored, and suspension (C) is rational. This is the stance Huxley labeled \u201cagnostic.\u201d\n\nb) Real\u2011world context: background information is evidence  \nIn practice we never reason in a vacuum. We know a great deal about biology, zoology, fossils, genetics, and about how often comparably extraordinary entities have turned up in well\u2011searched domains (never). All of that is indirect but genuine evidence and it strongly favors \u00acp.  \n\nBayesian statement:  \nPrior(\u201can as\u2011yet unknown, horse\u2011like mammal with a single horn exists somewhere\u201d) is very small because:  \n\u2022 It postulates extra, unobserved structure (Occam\u2019s razor penalizes complexity).  \n\u2022 Billions of observations of large land animals have revealed none that fit the description.  \n\nBecause the prior is already tiny, and nothing new has been observed, the posterior probability of p remains tiny. That is enough to license practical disbelief\u2014treat p as almost certainly false\u2014while still being ready to revise if serious evidence appears.\n\n4. \u201cAbsence of evidence\u201d vs. \u201cevidence of absence\u201d  \nWhen a domain has been thoroughly looked into, not finding the posited entity is itself evidence of absence. Russell\u2019s teapot, Sagan\u2019s invisible dragon, and the unicorn all fall in that class. Failure to detect them, given our ability and history of detecting similar things, is real counter\u2011evidence, not a mere absence of evidence.\n\n5. Where simplicity comes in  \nOccam\u2019s razor is not a tiebreaker after all other factors are equal; it is one of the evidential factors. More complex hypotheses receive lower prior probability, which rationally tilts us toward \u00acp even before direct observations are made.\n\n6. Summary  \n\u2013 If literally nothing bears on the question, rationality requires suspension of judgment.  \n\u2013 In any realistic case, abundant background evidence plus the simplicity principle heavily favors the negation, so the rational stance is to withhold acceptance of p and, for all practical purposes, treat p as false while remaining open to revision should credible evidence arrive."}]}
