Presumably there are antibodies in the donor that have neutralized the virus. Antibodies are just proteins that latch on to a target and help flag it so the hosts immune system recognizes the problem and eliminates it.   The donor antibodies will circulate for weeks to months in the host, but they cannot make more of themselves \u2014 they are just proteins originally made by B cells in the host. Therefore plasma infusions for these critically ill patients are just a temporary measure until their own bodies hopefully learn to eliminate the virus without help.", "rejected": "It's not the plasma that is injected. That is just what is extracted from the donor. The donated plasma is processed, refined, and the desired elements are extracted. In this case, the anti-Covid19 antibodies.

{"prompt": "CMV: NFTs are digital garbage whose popularity is fueled by greedy speculation. We\u2019ve seen this before\u2026 Hummel figurines, beanie babies, Thomas Kinkade \u2018collectibles\u2019. People will compete to spend money on tokens purely out of speculation under the misguided belief that \u201cThese are gonna be worth something someday.\u201d With NFTs, I don\u2019t believe there is any true value to them and as a medium, I do not believe they will have lasting artistic significance.   My current take is that NFTs are an offshoot of what I\u2019ll deem \u201cThe Blockchain Bubble\u201d. When I googled \u201cWhat makes an NFT valuable?\u201d I got this: \u201cFactors that make NFTs such a valuable investment are utility, ownership history, underlying value, perception of the buyer, liquidity premium and future value\u201d  All of this is subjective with a heavy profit motive, but the profit hinges on speculation not retailing or commodities.   People compare owning an NFT to owning an original painting or the Masters of a recording. The problem with this is - those products can be commoditized while an NFT can not.   Moreover, NFTs are not competitive in the digital ecosystem - there are literally BILLIONS of drawings paintings pictures songs and depictions that are free, all over the internet. They aren\u2019t scarce or limited - so why would I want to pay for something when I can obtain it for free?

However, it's very hard to work out what this would have to look like, and there are many paradoxes for any apparent account like this.  I favor the permissivist response that says that there are many different epistemic starting points, all permissible, and each carries a commitment to how much evidence of what sort is needed for any belief or disbelief. Different epistemic starting points lead to different beliefs with the same evidence, and can each be rational - there might be no rational way to decide between the starting points, but you just have to have one.", "rejected": "> Or should one reason that the claim is more likely to be false since it is a better explanation in terms of simplicity?  Yes. So let's use 'X' to designate our total acquaintance with the world. Now, suppose we have two theoretical accounts of X, one we designate 'I' which posits a great number of things we'll designate  'A', and another we designate 'II' which posits A plus something additional, let's designate 'B'. So, I theorizes X by positing A. II theorizes X by positing A and B. If I and II have equal explanatory value, on the grounds that positing B adds no explanatory value over the positing of A, then the posit of B is superfluous. And on this grounds should be rejected for the sake of parsimony.  Let's put this to a practical experiment. Suppose I propose that you owe me 10% of all the money you will make for the rest of your life, and I provide no evidence for this debt.

I'd say knowing electronics basics is a good start, the math included as well, basics components (resistors, capacitors, gates, Amps, diodes, transistors, ICs, etc)  Learn how to solder as it's always useful.  Master C as it's the most basic usable language that lets you do pretty much everything and have full control, skim over Assembly just to understand the very basics and concepts and then Python for a high level language as you can do a lot of things with the available libraries very quickly and for free.

That\u2019s another reason why Hindus or other Indian religions don\u2019t evangelise/proselytize.  Imagine if you went to a different country/region and asked the  people there to live by your culture. They would probably think \u201cno, we are not from your country,, we have our own traditions and values\u201d  Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, Buddhism etc  is part of Indian culture. Unless someone wants to adopt it, why we want them to?  Like you wouldn\u2019t tell a foreigner to live by your culture just because you do?  So, we don\u2019t tell people to adopt our traditions - unless they want to. They are ours.  I find it strange and very rude that people would want to convert others to their religion. It's extremely condescending and disrespectful that some people want everyone in the world to join their religion. One of the things that makes this world great, in my opinion, is different cultures, faiths and traditions - if you erase all but one, that takes a lot of the beauty of humanity away. I find that really sad.  You might say that in some religions, they have a command to spread their faith - this is true, but I say that it goes against the teaching that lots of religions have, which is respect, and respect should, in my view, is more important than how many people you have in your religion. The number of people you have in your religion, does not make it more true. That would be an ad populum fallacy, also known as appeal to popularity.   You also might say that people try to convert people to save them from torture. Well, if that sort of theology is true, I would question if that belief comes from God or humans, and would still not want to convert people. I see proselytising and evangelism almost as bad as murder. It goes against my ethical values completely.

Hindu Sanatan Dharma not only teaches tolerance for other religions but respect as well. Everyone is entitled to their own path, and none should be mocked or persecuted. H The often quoted proverb that conveys this attitude is, \"Ekam sat bahudha Vedanti\" which means, \"Truth is one, paths are many.\" No one path is correct; we are all striving for the same goal in our own unique way.

{"prompt": "CMV: The Freedom Dividend is a superior alternative to a $15/h minimum wage increase Little bit of background before I present my arguments: I was never really into UBI as a policy right now because the narrative pushed is usually something I don't necessarily agree with: automation is definitely going to cause mass unemployment and UBI will be necessary. I understand this is a possible future but I can also see a future where we simply adapt like we've done many times when the job market landscape changed significantly.  &#x200B;  However, after discussing the subject with a Yang supporter, it opened my eyes to seeing the Freedom Dividend as something else: a substitute for a $15 minimum wage increase. And the more I think about it, the more I'm convinced it would be better for pretty much anyone. So I'm wondering if I'm missing something crucial, or if I'm blindsighted in any way. Anyways, here are my arguments:  &#x200B;  Both of these proposals are ultimately taxing business, so the costs will be burdened by the consumer. Minimum wage would \"tax\" a lot of industries that are crucial for basic needs, such as food, clothes, etc. So we can pretty much expect a price increase in all of these industries that are paying their employees less than $15/h. The Freedom Dividend, if funded solely by VAT that excludes food services, would be one of the most progressive ways of redistributing money. It's an amazing way of finally making the really rich people pay their fair share. In order for any person to be worse off with the Freedom Dividend, they would have to spend $10,000 per month in goods that are NOT FOOD. So we're talking about a policy that is pretty much taking money from the top 5% of society that is spending that much and redistributing equally to everybody. And if we make sure to leave essential products such as food outside of the VAT, we make sure to not hurt poor people.  &#x200B;  1,000 a month equals $6.25/h salary increase. For someone currently making $9.00/h, the result of a Freedom Dividend vs Minimum Wage increase, when talking about money in their pockets, is essentially the same.  &#x200B;  Now, onto one of the main reasons I strongly prefer the Freedom Dividend over minimum wage increase: it's MUCH better for small business. If you force every new business owner to pay their employees $15/h when they're not even profiting and not even sure if their idea has a future, it puts people into a very difficult spot. Companies like Amazon/Walmart/Google can afford to pay people $15/h so they simply will do that, while working towards automating most of those jobs away at a faster pace. The companies that will be screwed are the local coffee shop, the local hardware store, etc. Small business are already hurting enough as it is with these huge companies cutting into their profits like crazy. This would be like a final nail in the coffin for a LOT of these business.  &#x200B;  But with a Freedom Dividend, not only you don't put the burden of paying $15/h to every single employee, now all of a sudden the husband and wife who opened the hardware store will have $2,000 guaranteed, no matter if they have a \"down-month\" or not. Think about the freedom we are giving these small business owners. The freedom to try something new and risky without fear of literally starving.  &#x200B;  And I haven't even mentioned about how $15/h will only accelerate automation and how it would hurt a lot of young people trying to get job experience.  &#x200B;  Did I miss anything here? This literally blew my mind and I can't believe it's not the MAIN thing people talk about when discussing UBI or the Freedom Dividend.", "preferred": "One of the huge problems with it is that in Yang's plan it will replace disability support. We can expect some macroeconomic effects on prices from this policy (i.e. rents will go up significantly) but you won't be able to claim your disability check if you claim your freedom dividend. Therefore, disabled people who rely on assistance from the government will be in an even worse spot than before.  Also, I don't see how a 10% VAT wouldn't hurt small businesses as well. If they want to charge the same price for everything, then they will have to lower the \"real\" price and make less profit.", "rejected": "Total retail sales in the US 2018 were 5.35 tn USD. Adding a 10% VAT  will probably reduce that somewhat, but assuming it stays stable, you just got 535 billion USD. That's enough for ~1670 USD/yr per person, or roughly $140 per month. And we've included essentials we don't intend to tax here.  In other words, you're falling *well* short of the money you need to fund that."}
{"prompt": "CMV: It does honestly seem kinda unfair to cancel all student loan debt I'm no conservative; I'm basically as leftist as they come, but cancelling all student debt seems a little bit unfair. I definitely think the government should help pay off student loan debt, especially because of predatory practices, and instate fair-priced college, but cancelling all student loan debt doesn't seem very equitable.  I just know plenty of people who have made huge sacrifices to avoid taking out student loans, like joining the military and going to lower-priced colleges despite getting accepted into much more prestigious ones, and cancelling all debt seems like a huge slap in the face to those people because they get set back for nothing--the people who took out loans get to have their cake and eat it too and it puts them at an advantage.  I still think it's kind of necessary, student loan debt is a huge crisis and just because it's unfair doesn't mean we shouldn't do it; it just leaves a really bad taste in my mouth.", "preferred": "> I just know plenty of people who have made huge sacrifices to avoid taking out student loans, like joining the military and going to lower-priced colleges despite getting accepted into much more prestigious ones, and cancelling all debt seems like a huge slap in the face to those people because they get set back for nothing--the people who took out loans get to have their cake and eat it too and it puts them at an advantage.  I haven't read all the responses but you can make your case much stronger than just this! Most people happen to be like your friends as well, so what has happened is that people with low incomes have generally taken on less student debt than people who were expecting to be able to pay that debt off with a lucrative job (e.g. lawyers and doctors) and are actually paying it off just fine despite having huge debt. So cancelling ALL debt also means people who took on a lot of debt because they expected to be able to pay it off with a lucrative job see a massive increase in their net worth despite having high incomes. Top 6% of the highest student debt owners make up for about $500B of student debt (about 33% of all student debt).  75% of students have gone to public schools with a median amount of debt around $10,000. Around 15% have gone to non-profit private schools and their median debt is about $20,000 (but remember, people like your friends deliberately made the decision not to go to these schools precisely for the reasons you outline). The remainder have gone to for-profit schools which have predatory advertising and lending practices and deliberately target older people, minorities, single parents and women, who are tricked by the marketing because they want to be able to provide for their family better. Regardless of whether we should forgive their debt or not (I think we should forgive at least something), these predatory institutions will continue to exist even if you do a one-time forgiveness.  Based on these numbers, it makes sense to me to forgive maybe $10,000-$20,000 of debt which would wipe it out entirely for at least 50% of students, most of whom went to public school because they couldn't afford it. People who have more than $50,000, for the most part can actually afford to pay it off.  I don't have any hard data on this but a 3.4% interest rate on student loan means that for the last 10 years, people with high incomes would have been much better off taking their savings and putting it into the stock market and making the minimum required payments on their debt, which I suspect they mostly have. If I am right, then we are rewarding these people that have already made a lot of money.  BY THE WAY, let's also keep in mind that only 15% of Americans actually have any student debt at all and they overwhelmingly tend to be concentrated in the top 30% of society, which means that full student debt forgiveness is a massive wealth transfer for a lot of people in the top 30% of America while it does absolutely nothing for 85% of Americans, particularly the ones that never went to college and have to work back-breaking working class jobs.  TLDR; full student debt cancellation is massively regressive and, you are right, we shouldn't do it.", "rejected": "Cancelling student loan debt has never been about letting people get out of loans. Yes, that's the method, but not really the goal.  The goal of cancelling student loan debt is boosting the economy and supporting the future. Right now the age of marriage, childbirth, and major purchasing (homes, cars, etc.) continues to rise because people with student loans are putting it off. This is *bad for the economy*. We already have an issue of not being able to support the upcoming senior population while leaving social security intact because of the smaller work force. Now people aren't putting money into the economy either. It's just going to the government (private loans aside, which still don't really enter the economy). Homebuilding, new cars, even vacations, weddings and stupid weekend toys like an ATV are all big ways to make money move.  On top of that, they also aren't saving for retirement, and many are going to have to help their parents who did not save enough, so we're creating a future problem where we'll have a whole group of people who don't have full equity in their homes, don't have savings to live off of, and don't have social security to rely on.  It will create yet another age group where it's harder to get hired as a young person because old people can't quit, and forcing the younger generations to support the older generations significantly.  Is it unfair to the poor? Perhaps, but unfortunately they were always going to be in that situation (not necessarily the individual, but the economic concept). Is it unfair to those who paid it off? Maybe, but they're contributing to the economy in an expected way. The wealthy won't have a problem either way. But the middle class is burdened in a way that doesn't look good for the future economy right now, not even mentioning the multiple recessions the age group has gone through.  It doesn't have to be student loan debt. Subsidizing homes, playing with taxes or interest rates in a way that encourage big spending and long-termsavings, reducing healthcare costs could all help. But student loans are one solution, and are frankly a relatively easy solution."}

Some buddies and I are talking about building a submarine drone that can explore the bottom of a lake with a max depth of 400'. This is a hobby level project so we don't need anything too fancy. We are thinking of having a fiber optic cable connect the sub to a surface boat/buoy for direct control/video feed.   &#x200B;  We are all very circuit/programming oriented and do not know a lot about how we are going to implement all the physical parts such as the hull, the ballasts, propellers, etc. We are considering pre-made options but we are also willing to design these things if need be. Any guidance/direction to help us get started would be greatly appreciated.", "preferred": "To 400ft.  Any steel pipe you can buy should stand up to that.  Buy a pipe and seal it off.  Tie it to a rope and drop it to the bottom pull it up and see if it's dry on the inside or at least dry enough on the inside.  Also, if this isn't ever going to have a person inside it, a wet sub might be easier to build.  Most of the remote subs going to crazy depths don't attempt to house everything in a single sealed hull in lieu of sealing individual components where necessary.  It should come a little surprise that it's far easier to keep something small like a motor housing dry than to keep an entire tube dry.  Further if the parts can get wet, let them.  You'll need some onboard electronics but again, easier to seal a box the size of a battery and micro controller than it is to seal a standalone hull housing all elements of your robot.  If I were doing it, I'd design my dry space first.  Build a mold.  Buy triaxial fiberglass, a vacuum pump and the other equipment necessary to do a vacuum infused hull.  Just really layer it up.  But like I said a steel pipe is likely to work well.    In terms of how you keep stuff dry everything needs a seal.  In submersible design generally you seal everything possible and there will still be leakage so you have a bilge pump that can push more outward pressure is attempting to get in.  The water is going to get past your seals, just pump it back out.  Lastly.  Not sure you're going deep enough for it to matter, but consider designs that are leaky at the surface but utilize the pressure to tighten seal as you dive.  If you properly design a seal and hull the increased pressure from diving will actually serve to further enforce the seal.  Conversely.  You don't want to install a seal anywhere where the increasing dive pressure would cause your seal to get less effective.  If you're using a pipe or radial design, you will have external water pressure creating a negative hoop stress, and that makes it easier to ensure your seals are going to get pressed tighter together as you dive.  If you are designing something Aaymetrical you want to make sure that your seals aren't in places that water pressure causes the hull to diverge.  Place them creatively at places that get pinched together", "rejected": "These guys might be helpful at least for picking apart what they've done already, getting specs and a few clues to design considerations, even if you don't need the full kit and all the gizmos - a lot of the heavy lifting is already done + system software and a support community etc. Max depth on their kit is only 100m (328ft) so you'll need to do a bit of beefing up, at least."}

These kinds of animals do appear to be limited in their growth by the availability of oxygen.  However, the non-avian dinosaurs which grew to be the largest land animals to ever walk the Earth lived at a time when oxygen was probably LOWER and at best about the same levels as they are today.

Asthma is a systemic disease, therefore could still be present following transplant. However, the bronchospastic response seen in asthma is dependent on smooth muscle activation as a downstream target. During lung transplantation, the donor lung is denervated, meaning the nervous system connection to the host is severed. When transplanted, the new lung is not connected to the recipient\u2019s nervous system, and so typically transplant patients who had asthma prior to surgery do not suffer from asthma symptoms post-operatively.   That being said, there is a recent case report describing reversible airway obstruction (the hallmark of asthma) in a post-transplant patient, however I personally felt their explanations were unsatisfactory.", "rejected": "Probably not an entire lobe but there are certainly variations within the tissue itself so you have diseases and inflamed areas of tissue next to healthy areas of tissue.

{"prompt": "If ground beef should be cooked all the way through, why do some restaurants ask how you want your burger done? Shouldn\u2019t the standard be that a burger be cooked medium-well?", "preferred": "Bacteria grows on the outside of meat and grows slowly inwards. So if you take a piece of steak and leave it out awhile, some bacteria might land on the steak. When you cook it then you are searing the outside first killing any germs. Now if you use that steak to create ground beef, the bacteria is now scrambled up so could be right in the centre, so it should be cooked all the way through. However, if you are grinding your beef fresh and are confident that it was properly stored etc. you can then cook it less because you know there is no bacteria.", "rejected": "They probably grind it themselves"}

I stay with my grandparents & had gone to the doctors a few months ago & had told them I had gone for a different reason than what I was actually going for as to not worry them. My grandma had told my aunt & my aunt had looked at the computer & messaged me privately saying she knew I had gone for something else than what I had told my grandparents I was going for.

{"prompt": "Is it possible to use red cabbage in a cake? (like carrots in carrot cake?) I\u2019ll probably just try this out, unless someone tells me its doomed to fail.

Recently, Christina Tosi posted a recipe for \u201cSummer Bars\u201d which was a citrus flavored carrot cake, and that gave me the idea to sub in red cabbage because cabbage + citrus is a good flavor combo. I tried searching online for info about subbing in cabbage or baking with cabbage and couldn\u2019t find anything. Maybe that\u2019s an indication that this is a bad idea, but I\u2019m not sure why. Is the cabbage too wet? Is the flavor too strong? Does the color get lost when it\u2019s baked?

Some neighborhoods are gated with a security guard, so those guys need to get paid too. That\u2019s really all HOA\u2019s *should* be for and that\u2019s reasonable because how else would those things get done?   There are some rules that would be reasonable to enforce too, like noise violations, not littering, making sure dangerous trees (that are at risk of falling) are removed, etc. You very well should be allowed to do what you want with your property most of the time, but when we live around other people we shouldn\u2019t infringe on their safety or comfort either, and the HOA can handle small issues that don\u2019t necessarily need to be escalated to the police.   The ones that want to fine your for having the wrong color doorknob or a weed in the garden can fuck right off though.", "rejected": "FWIW, I've lived in non-HOA neighborhoods and HOA neighborhoods.  I've also been a member on an HOA board.  First, HOA's *can* be bad.  You can find abuses of power in anything.  HOA's are no exception.  However, I'd be willing to bet that for every horror story you hear, there are plenty more good (or neutral) stories.  HOA's are like IT guys.  If they are doing their job well you'll never hear about them.  Second, from my time on a HOA board and since then while listening to neighbors complain, it's pretty clear that people don't understand how HOA's work.  They can't just make up rules and enforce them.  HOA's are regulated by state laws.  There are also legal avenues that they must proceed through to get things done.  Right now everybody in my hood in complaining because a guy keeps an old RV in his driveway and has a couch on his porch.  It's pretty trashy.  But neighbors think the HOA isn't doing anything about it because nobody has told them as such.  In reality, IF the neighbor is violating the HOA rules, then the HOA will probably send them a letter, a 2nd letter, fine them, then eventually send it to collections.  It can be a pretty long process.  Additionally, HOA's are meant to keep property values high and to make the neighborhood a desirable place to live.  I've lived in non-HOA neighborhoods where my neighbor decided a plastic polar bear statue was an appropriate front lawn decoration all year round.  Another neighborhood had a 2-story tall statue in his back yard behind his 1-story tall house.  Other neighbors had junk in their front yard.  This was a pretty big neighborhood.    And HOA's don't just pull rules out of their asses.  When you buy a house with an HOA, you are given the HOA covenants to look over.  Unfortunately, I don't think most people actually read them since they act so surprised when they get a letter of non-compliance.    That's on the homeowner for not doing their due diligence.  That would be like if you got upset at your office when you broke a rule that was in the employee handbook you didn't read.  When you buy a house with an HOA, you are entering a legal agreement with that HOA.  Lastly, they are optional.  If you don't want to live in an HOA and you'd rather park a non-functional car on your front lawn, then go buy a house that's not in an HOA.  If you want to build a house, buy some land and hire a contractor.  New neighborhoods are all going to have an HOA because the developer wants to ensure the neighborhood is always looking nice so he can sell more houses."}
{"prompt": "Are new washing machines better at cleaning than washing machines of the past? Disregarding things like energy efficiency, noise, weight do newer machines clean any better than an older machine?", "preferred": "Cool topic, glad I can contribute.  Let's begin with the gold standard of washing clothes, by hand. Historically clothes were washed by hand, usually across some kind of metal washboard. Disregarding soap, this is effective because it pushes and pulls the cloth apart so that the dirt can 'fall out'. Bar none this technique will yield the cleanest clothes.  Next came top loaders, which operate on the principle of creating a soapy bath with an agitator in the center to move that water. This is not as effective as the clothes are not able to open and close their fibers during the process, but are merely sitting in a bath.  And then front loaders came around. Now you have a washer that can better replicate the hand process as it turns and spins, giving better cleaning properties to the batch.   This isn't really new knowledge either. Dyson in particular have known this for quite a while, and being the innovators they are, created a new set of washers to mimic the hand washing process better. They are essentially front loaders with 2 separate barrels that rotate out of sync from one another, providing the needed 'push pull' to really clean well.", "rejected": "Both washers and detergent are worse than you remember.  In 1993, phosphates were banned in US laundry detergent.   Phosphates, when discharged into bodies of water, make algae blooms and other increases in plant growth that disrupt the ecosystem for fish and other marine animals.  Unfortunately, this reduced the effectiveness of washing machines.   In 2007, new federal regulations for efficiency made clothes washers perform worse. And more expensive as front loaders more easily meet the specs."}
{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old: Why is it so hard to wake up early even though we've had the same amount of time sleeping? I went to bed at 11 and woke up at 7, and it was super difficult.  But I ordinarily go to bed at around 12;30-1 am and wake up around 9.  I am getting the same amount of hours of sleep but it is much harder to wake up at 7, as opposed to 9.  Why is that?  EDIT: Grammar", "preferred": "This is due to your circadian rhythm. It isn't feasible to adjust your circadian rhythm by more than an hour a day. So if your sleep schedule has a sudden change your circadian rhythm won't be able to catch up. This is primary factor in jet lag as well.  Interesting note- Some people are more controlled by their circadian rhythm than others. The sleep schedule of night owls is almost entirely dictated by their circadian rhythms. The opposite is true of morning people, who tend to not have their sleep cycles controlled by their circadian rhythm. They instead, and much to their benefit in society, get tired when they are low on sleep (ie the end of the day).", "rejected": "Could just be waking up during a rem cycle versus after one. If you go to bed at say, 815, and sleep for 8 hours, or go to bed at 915 and sleep for 7, you'd feel just as well rested because of the rem cycle. However if you went to bed at 845, and still woke up the same time 7 hours or so later, you'd feel more tired than you would just going to bed at 915. Even if you slept an extra 15-20 mins, you wake up in the middle of a rem cycle, which makes you feel tired. Often it's better to go to bed at specific times than guaranteeing a number of hours of sleep, depending when you need to wake, because of rem cycles. There's a calculator for it, not always very accurate, but gives you an idea."}

{"prompt": "[TX] Dealing with Employee's Endless Complaints about Pay I'm looking for some feedback or advice on dealing with a specific situation involving an employee that complains about the pay at our agency.   Just a little background: we are a non-profit with less than 50 employees that provide behavioral health and substance abuse prevention to schools and other community sites in Texas. We are primarily funded through contracts with the state.   We have been doing employee engagement surveys for several years. In the last 3 years, we began using employee net promoter scores in surveys every 6 months. We also survey the employees on their experiences with specific programs. The surveys have been anonymous.   We have one employee that has complained about pay on every survey since 2016. While anonymous, this individual's writing style and speech are identical and they have said some of the same complaints to others in the office, who in turn have shared with the supervisors. Despite the anonymity, we know who it is. We have shared data comparing our pay to the related job market gathered from other similar providers, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and census data. We have provided a breakdown to the employees that their pay is above average for our field and even the median household income for our location.   Yet, this was not enough to convince them. They wanted to compare our pay to the job market on whole.   We don't provide the annual cost of living increases but do give increases based on performance between 1% and 5%. In response to the complaints (there were actually some other employees that recommend changes to the pay, just not as relentlessly as this individual), we have increased the amount that the agency pays for the employee's insurance, implemented an employee assistance program, and given 6% cost of living increase across the board.   Even after all that, they continue to complain in the anonymous surveys but won't say anything directly not negotiate their pay and they won't seek other employment.   So, my questions are:  1. Should we address this with the employee?   2. How should it be addressed with them? Email, direct meeting, something else? 3. How do I address the issue without affecting the anonymity component of the surveys?  Thanks for any help.  TL;DR - Employee has been complaining anonymously about their pay for over 6 years and we're getting sick of it. What do we do?", "preferred": "1. Not unless they come to you. The survey was anonymous, it is a breach of trust already that you've identified the anonymous surveyor. 2. If you absolutely must take action, consider a plan that would involve everyone: For example, maybe put together a Lunch & Learn on the current benefits offered by your company including how folks can take advantage of less used ones, mention how your company generally determines salary ranges and benefits, and what makes you competitive in the local market. Close the meeting with an opportunity to discuss any ideas for benefits they wish you offered, as well as a reminder that folks are always welcome to come by to discuss ideas and suggestions. (And it should go without saying, but remember that Lunch & Learns with free lunch are always better received than BYO). 3. Absolutely do not take actions directly tying the employees survey response to them. If they mention it to you directly, then you can discuss it. Otherwise, no.  Also: That cost of living increase is a good step, but it barely covers inflation for 2021. It's not a raise, it's a keeping-up increase. Try not to spin that as a raise, simply recognize it as your company acknowledging what's going on with the market and doing your best to keep up.", "rejected": "As others have said...it is anonymous.

{"prompt": "Are you expected to work 60-70 hours a week in the academia? This is part rant and part question. I had an introductory meeting with about 15-16 other PhD students who had just started and the session included a question answer session with professors where anonymous questions could be asked. One individual, whose supervisor expected him to work weekends as well, asked the professors how he can politely tell his supervisor that this isnt right.  The response of one of the professors was:  \"We are in this because we love science. If you don't want to work weekends, perhaps you do not love science and you do not belong here. If that is the case, you should leave.\"  I was rather shocked. I admit that I do put in extra hours because I want to and have to because of my horrible productivity throughout the day.

From my understanding, it's considered quite healthy to have hobbies outside of work - and if work is taking up 60-70 hours per week, that doesn't give much time for those, let alone a family or any relationships outside of work.  There is this great organization called the National Center for Faculty Development & Diversity that really emphasizes work-life balance. I know several faculty members who follow their programs and are quite successful (have a life outside of work and are making research waves, while remaining excellent instructors), so it definitely can be done."}
{"prompt": "How do you lead a team and complete a project well without being a dictator/bad leader when your team do not not stick with deadlines As part of my group projects at university (studying mechanical engineering) I am always one of the first to get a head start on the project as I believe everything should be done almost as soon as possible in case problems arise and in so I set a plan/timetable for the group which we all discuss and come to an agreement on. However during this group project no one started until the very end resulting in a poor finish for the group and therefore made my own work seem insignificant because the product was a poor finished one overall.   I assume the workplace is similar and so my question is, how do Engineers lead teams in the work place and how do you lead a team without being a strict unbending dictator (therefore lowering morale and giving you a negative image).", "preferred": "Based on all the current comments, you now understand that work != school, paying to take a class != being paid to complete a project, and so forth.  I'll mention this: deadlines in school are always arbitrary. Arbitrary deadlines in industry are a sure sigh of a death march to a filed project. Time is always a function of scope and resources. These relationships are fixed, but are not a formula. Estimating the duration of a project is complex and difficult. We generally know the scope and the cost; we cannot predict the weather (construction), or availability of resources (\"I quit\", \"We've reprioritzed Jimmy to another super urgent project\").  In your situation, you might try this: don't focus on the product so much at first. Instead, focus on the risks. For instance, in your first team meeting, ask who has vacations planned for this semester. Why? It's a project risk to have project resources unavailable.  When someone suggests a project solution, start asking about the time it will take to obtain the materials, tooling, etc. Make a chart of those lead times. Lead times are project risks. If one component slips its delivery date, all components may suffer.  Risks are usually more engaging for the mind. We're wired that way. Once the team starts inventorying the risks and then begins to decide how to manage each risk, the whole project will begin to move more smoothly. Notice that the team inventories and manages the risks. You, as a lead, do not say \"Oh that's easy; we'll just do xyz.\" This causes everyone else to disengage. This is bad. The desired outcome is the whole team owns the project, whether is succeeds or fails. Paradoxically, this is the best risk management and assures the highest probability for success.  Team projects are one part about the project and three parts about the team. What you've experienced so far is being in a group, not being on a team. Learn how to engage others and your groups will trend towards becoming teams. This is true in industry as well.", "rejected": "Do it yourself and when you can't, submit a request to use an outside vendor.

If the project is important enough, they will fund the outside vendor, if it isn't the resources' time will be reallocated and the manager *should* have a discussion with them about where they are focusing their time."}
{"prompt": "Why are American public universities run like businesses? In the US, many universities are public in that they're theoretically owned and operated by the government. Why is it then that they're allowed to set their own policy, salaries, hunt for alumni donations, build massive sports complexes, and focus on profitability over providing education as a public service and being more strictly regulated like elementary and high schools?", "preferred": "Something I don't think I saw mentioned is the administrative creep of higher ed.  Universities used to be largely run through a process of shared governance where faculty had a major voice in the running of a university.  Faculty generally have preferences to spend university resources on teaching and research.  This voice has greatly eroded over time.  I have served on many executive level search committees and they will talk about there being an academic side and a business side and that faculty should have no voice in the business operations of a university.  What this also means is that faculty have little to no voice in the budget of a university.    I've been at 5 different universities, and all of them had a rough budget breakdown of about 1/3 toward academics and 2/3 toward non-academics.  That 2/3 also controls the budget and those people are business people.  They are lawyers, accountants, finance, MBAs, HR, marketing, all the same type people you see running any other business or non-profit.  We have people freely move between us and a hospital system or a large corporation or any other large organization.  They run the university and many (yes I'm stereotyping, but I have run into too many of these) have disdain for the faculty and students.  Their job is to audit books or check off compliance reports and the academic mission of the institution just makes their job harder to do.  So it all becomes about a mindset.

For example, recently a team of Archaeologists found a set of skulls in a track of burial shafts and tombs; in which all said skulls' mandibles showed signs of disease, \\the primary cause being in relation to dental anatomy rather than plague, other general health issues, etc\\], and concluded that it was likely due too Attrition; one of the most prevalent dental and health issues in Ancient Egypt  (alongside a general lack of dental knowledge) -- in which their diet of uncooked vegetables and bread \\[which had large amounts of grit and sand within it\\] led to a lack of necessary minerals and vitamins, and wore away their enamel, leading too inflammation of the jawbone, gums, tooth loss, etc, and would lead to abscesses, inflammation of the jawbone and gums and tooth loss.  However, whilst they hadn\u2019t established dentistry, \\[in the modern sense\\], they did create the world\u2019s oldest known formula for toothpaste, in which they would crush rock, mint, salt, pepper and dried iris flower to create a tooth cleaning powder. Whilst this would initially clean the teeth of plaque - the concoction is now known to have caused bleeding gums and pain in \\[primarily succedaneous\\] teeth, mandible and maxilla.  Moreover, the Egyptians also had numerous mouthwashes to combat gum disease, which usually had to be chewed up and spit out; and where made with an amalgamation of ingredients, such as bran and celery, \\[some included more active ingredients\\], in which was used to provide the patient with a form of pain relief from toothache and other oral pains, (others were just for the singular purpose of preserving a healthy mouth and teeth).  And, according to a variation of historians, dental braces (and similar dentistry practices) date back to as far as the Egyptian period. These theories where concluded as being fact when Archaeologists discovered mummies with metal bands around their teeth and believe that said bands were used to create pressure on the teeth and gums, and would lead too movement of said teeth into a more aesthetically pleasing (or less painful) position. Onward from that, it was also found that lost teeth were reattached by means of silver or gold wire, and would be clipped onto the remaining teeth. However, it's not (yet) known if these procedures were performed when the patient was alive - or post-mortem. This was theorised because the Egyptians placed a large amount of value on the appearance of the dead, to which they would be assured that the deceased were sent off 'correctly' into the afterlife.  &#x200B;  **References:**  [http://www.freshdentalcare.co.uk/extracting-the-egyptians-dentistry-in-ancient-egypt/  https://www.nature.com/articles/sj.bdj.2009.309  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19396207  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;", "rejected": "I ended up binge watching the Timeliness World History YouTube channel's medieval documentaries (especially the let's cook ones) which mentioned dental health due to the results of their diets.

For plastics you break a long interwoven chain of molecules, kind of like cutting a cloth.   Breaking suff made of a pure element, the surface you expose to air instantly reacts, mostly to air to form oxidation (in Iron we call that rust).   Also if you break something from a physics stand point you lose a lot of small material, tiny shards or dust, so you would not be able to find all of that and thus be able to put it 100% back together.

So it\u2019s very material dependent in what it takes to cause things to bond\u2026 wood in a pencil is different as it\u2019s a \u201cstructure of cells\u201d not an individual element so once the cells are snapped apart the dead wood in a pencil will not \u201cmend\u201d as the living structure no longer exists.  However in fairly simplistic terms the roots of trees are often cut and the \u201ctops\u201d of other trees grafted onto the rootstock.  The plant then repairs itself and a hybrid plant grows.  Many commercial apple trees grow on rootstock from other trees to help control their size or increase water take up. And go on to live a long and happy life.

{"prompt": "What are the limits of ethics using AI to write a manuscript Short history: Can I use ChatGPT to rewrite one or a couple of paragraphs to resolve reviewers' comments? Am I cheating?     I just discovered the ChatGPT3 from OpenAI and I'm in love. It has helped me a lot to overcome a creative block I was facing to finish a manuscript from my PhD where 2 of 3 coauthors (the 2 advisors) are quite absent, and for this reason, I stopped working on this manuscript for 1.5 years. Every time I tried to take it back I felt anxious and blocked. However, I'm currently passing a great moment of my life that brings me back to the joying of scientific writing, especially a couple of high-impact manuscript acceptance this last month.  Thus, using the ChatGPT I got the draft of two paragraphs that helped a lot to move fast with this manuscript. Because I'm deeply editing these two paragraphs I think there are no ethical concerns about it. However,  today I ask the ChatGPT to rewrite the paragraph of the objectives in another manuscript that received a minor review. The major concern is the lack of clarity in the objectives. Thus, I just asked to the ChatGPT rewrite this in a clearer manner and nail it. The paragraph is amazing now and I'm planning to use it directly as it is in the manuscript to send back to the journal.

I've been using Scopus to compare publication records of academics in my field who have received early career grants to get an idea of what I should be aiming for. In doing this I've noticed that most people have a similar number of publications - usually 1-2 first author papers per year, plus a more variable number of co-authored papers further down the author list.   However, there are some people who are comparably prolific, publishing upwards of 4 first-author publications a year multiple times in the first 5 years of their career (highest I've seen is 7 in one year), usually alongside many more co-authored papers. These authors are publishing in reputable journals with solid citations so they aren't just targeting easier journals.  I've noticed that this usually occurs when the authors sticks closely to the same topic, sometimes even the same dataset (cohort studies in public health/psychology/psychiatry), or studies of different cohorts testing the same/similar research question.  I'm curious about some less obvious differences that might be present. Writing on the same topic/data over and over of course is going to make writing faster and reduce time spent collecting data, but I don't think it's the whole story. I assume there must be other contextual factors at play, as well some differences in how these authors work.

Are desserts in these other countries not normally this sweet?   When I think of dessert, it's something that *should* be very sweet, but also eaten in small amounts, and enjoyed in moderation.

Kind of a special occasion thing. I've tasted desserts/sweets from other countries (especially Asian countries) and while I don't mind them, I certainly don't prefer them. I think it just comes down to regional preferences.   Even the Americans that don't like 'traditional' American desserts, in my experience, tend to come from cultures/countries where excessive sweetness is already disliked (or perhaps just not the norm), and they bring that dislike with them.

Trump is an asshole.  His personality is brash and it can turn off a lot of people.  Part of this was displayed when he would make crazy tweets.  The media and his political opponents quickly used his tweets to attack him and spread misinformation about him, which clearly swayed voters.  Part of the reason he lost in 2020 is because people didn\u2019t like his behavior, independent on where he stood on political issues.  Many suburban women were turned off by his personality and did not support Trump in 2020.    Without the social media, he has less opportunity to say stupid things, or things that would turn off voters on the fence.

{"prompt": "Advice on writing a reference letter for a mediocre student? I supervised her Master's dissertation (the quality of which was only so-so), and she's asked me to write a reference letter for her application to a teacher training school. I agreed because I'm her only real option; she hasn't interacted much with other members of staff over the last year. She's plenty smart and her grades are not terrible, and I do believe her interest in education is sincere, but she also has social anxiety issues and occasional bouts with depression that have interfered with her academics. It's difficult to imagine her interacting with a classroom of students every day.  I'm not convinced that she's suited for teaching as a profession, and I feel a letter that speaks only to her positive attributes would be misleading. At the same time, I don't know her well enough to say that she couldn't rise to the challenge, and I don't want to be responsible for denying her at least the opportunity to give it a try. I'm not sure what other career options she has. I would appreciate any thoughts or advice on this dilemma, any suggestions for writing a letter that doesn't paint her in an unrealistic light, but also won't immediately torpedo her chances at being accepted.", "preferred": "> I'm not convinced that she's suited for teaching as a profession, and I feel a letter that speaks only to her positive attributes would be misleading.  Then it sounds like you shouldn't be writing a letter of recommendation for her. Listen, your duty is to your students, not their potential employers. You either need to inform her you can no longer fulfill your duty (which is a perfectly acceptable thing to do), or bite the bullet and stick to the positives. Look at her CV or ask her for a quick interview if you need help. Your university's office that aids with student employment should have resources to help guide you through this process. Above all, don't sabotage a student's career because you're too embarrassed to say, no, to them.  As a reminder, a student's mental health history (health history in general) is protected by their right to privacy.

{"prompt": "Is having a job slavery? I mean hear me out for a second.  How much choice do we all really have as individuals when it comes to finding a way to generate income or a \"living\"?

Anyone's opinion or guidance would be greatly appreciated.", "preferred": "> Maybe we all are slaves to this system that we created.   I would like to question that. How did you or I create \"this system\"?  It is important because I tend to think, as Rousseau said, that \"Obedience to the law we have prescribed is freedom\"; and that is the point of democracy. But if we are only following laws and rules that were set long ago, we are no longer free, and we might be under the tyranny of other people.  Whenever the 'system' is being challenged, there is often a conservative discourse that will explain us that we need to accept the constraints of the real world, usually economic laws. Resources are limited, and we need to work for food, for housing... this is not unreasonable in itself, but however this discourse can be overused. Just to give a precise example, why are workers in Amazon warehouses obliged to pee in bottles to be more productive, while Jeff Bezos is the richest person on Earth? He could certainly reduce the pressure on workers a bit and reduce his ambition.  Now, questioning the social and economic status quo requires way more time and space than we have here. There are certainly massive determinisms in our world, and that tend to serve established interests. It doesn't mean however that there is no freedom. We always have some room for manoeuvre that we can use.

{"prompt": "Update to Previous Post Regarding Cough Up Blood After Workout. Results Were Surprising    Age: 31  Sex: M  Height: 6'6\"  Weight: 250 Athletic  Race: White/Caucasian  Duration: 4 1/2 Months  Location: Lungs/Upper Respiratory, Upper G/I  Current Diagnosis: **Stage 4 Aggressive Gastro-Intestinal Cancer**  Current Meds: Pain Killers, Diuretics  As needed Meds: Lidocaine Patches, Anti-Nausea,  M**elatonin** sleep aid  Original:  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/c2ls61/chronic\\_cough\\_and\\_now\\_coughing\\_up\\_blood\\_after/?utm\\_medium=android\\_app&utm\\_source=share   So after spending some time at an Urgent Care, getting some scans lined up and trying to be patient, I woke up one morning to pain and compression over my chest. Urgent Care Docs had advised me that any escalation of symptoms should mean I go to the Emergency Room. Once there they almost immediately checked me into the ICU for observation and began running every test you could name. For the next 4/5 days I did just an unreal number of scans, 2 biopsies, and they drew enough blood to fill a small pool. Pain escalated daily while there so finding a solution was a running theme. So after a lot of trails here's what they found:  Current: Stage 4 Aggressive Metastatic Gastrointestinal Cancer ( Adenocarcinoma )  Previous: Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation   After doing a Lymph Node & Bone Marrow Biopsy they found my marrow filled to capacity with dead cancer cells. This pointed them in the right direction. My platelets were crashing daily (20,000 at admission) and I've got inflamed lymph nodes throughout my chest cavity which is one source of my (significant and at time escalating) pain. Its infiltrated my lungs and several vertebrae along my spine (causing vertebrae to show signs of Osteopenia) . Weirdly enough there's no noticeable tumor/mass/lump they can trace it back to. It's kind of just spread throughout (described as Adenocarcinoma) , though they were finally able to locate a small ulcer in my stomach that allowed them to finally be able to classify it. I've currently just completed my 3rd (now weekly) round of chemo (we started asap when other options such as clinical trials were deemed a non-option) and we've been able to stabilize a number of things (blood factors such as platelets, hemoglobin and the like) along the way. Many of my blood counts are still in the trash so clinical trails are not currently an option. In early stages of my 3 weeks hospital visit I was in a state called **DIC (**Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation) which caused me to act like something akin to a blood squirt gun if i bled. Essentialy it screws with you clotting factors and any bleeding event is an issue. Any procedure became an issue and many my numbers were artifically raised in order to attempt anything that would cause me to bleed. Fortunately after a week of treatments and what felt like several wheel barrows of infusions we kicked my body out of D.I.C and am more or less clotting normally. Fun story: early one morning after the vampires took their daily does of my blood a CNA came in to do a routine vitals check. This particular morning they took 2 unique sets of blood samples plus a rather large sample for testing against infectious disease. This was also kind of at the height of my \"he's not clotting\" phase. During the blood pressure check it popped open all the fresh holes in my arm, causing them to bleed and freaked/surprised the CNA. Made me laugh. (end of story).  Immunotherapy is what my Oncologist are banking on right now so crossing my fingers. Chemo is causing reasonable progress (numbers are low but stable) so we're staying the course for now. My personal mid->long term goal is to find an alternative to opiates for pain management (who the hell knows why a person tolerates opiates for a buzz cause constipation sucks!!!) so looking at alternatives (THC pills potentially or preferably resolving the issue that's causing me pain)  I've been discharged from the hospital after 3 weeks so now I'm working to find a routine that works. Losing weight so a short term goal is stopping that (I'm rather tall and (was) muscular so my bodies nuking whatever calories I put in and I'm not putting in a lot due to general nausea, but smoothies have been my friend.

She now faces overwhelming medical costs and potentially life-long disability. This happened in Missouri last week. My SO's aunt had a very intense headache and knew something was wrong because she had never had a migraine before. She started feeling numb in the right half of her body and called her sister, who told her to immediately go to the ER for a stroke screening. Upon arriving and telling the staff she was worried she was having a stroke, she was left alone in the waiting area for 6 hours until she collapsed and began seizing.   The doctors said she had a blood clot in her brain that caused her initial symptoms before bursting and leading to bleeding within her brain. She was airlifted to a large hospital in mid-Missouri and is still there, receiving treatment.   She is stable and aware, but cannot speak correctly or control the affected side of her body. It has been heartbreaking to see her children's reactions to seeing their mom like this and her pain at not being in control of her body.   The cost of everything will be overwhelming and not something the family should be concerned with at the moment, yet  the helicopter ride to the larger hospital alone will likely be $20,000 or so, not to mention the week long hospital stay, CT scans, therapy, etc...  I work in healthcare and everyone I've spoken to about this incident is livid. We teach stroke symptoms to children for Pete's sake! The difference between treatment of a stroke immediately after symptoms appear and even 6 hours later can be life altering, and any emergency department should be aware of this. The fact she was presenting stroke symptoms as well as verbally requesting stroke screening and then left on her own until she having seizure is absolutely infuriating.

{"prompt": "'Classic' books by female philosophers Hi /r/askphilosophy,  About two weeks ago I looked at my bookshelves and attempted to count how many books written by female authors I had. To cut a short story shorter, there weren't many, and the number included 0 philosophers. Call it hiding under a rock, but for whatever reason I had never even considered that I haven't read many female philosophers.  In my current philosophy class, we briefly discussed that equality of gender in roles such as academia are not only important because, of, well, equal opportunity etc., but also, more critical here, is that it has been raised as possible that the topics focused on by women philosophers and the way that women philosopher approach topics can be completely different.  To that end, in the interest of learning more about this, are there any particular important texts by female philosophers that any collection of 'classic' philosophers should include? My interests are usually in political philosophy and ethics.  Any suggestions would be useful though :)", "preferred": "Philosophy as a field tends to be dominated by classic *articles* more than classic books, at least in the past century.

Anscombe's *Intention*, Annette Baier's *Postures of the Mind*, Judith Butler's *Bodies that Matter*, Pat Churchland's *Neurophilosophy*, Philippa Foot's *Natural Goodness*, and Susanna Siegel's *The Contents of Visual Experience*. That list is kind of a grab-bag off the top of my head - some texts, like Anscombe's and Foot's, are undisputed classics, while some are probably only considered very important in my area of study.", "rejected": "Philosophy is, unfortunately, one of those fields which is usually dominated by men. It depends on what types of philosophy you're interested in, but you could always read things by Simone de Beauvoir, Iris Marion Young, or Audrey Lorde if you're interested in feminism and politics."}

{"prompt": "Ethics of Leaving a Job Very Early-On I am an electrical engineer that just recently graduated with my BS with a focus in industrial controls and automation. I took a position with a fairly large consulting company before the pandemic began back in December. My start date was then pushed from May to August because of the virus and a lack of work. However now that I have started I am becoming increasingly frustrated as I am being given very little guidance, receiving little to no communication (currently working from home), and very little meaningful work. I am becoming increasingly unsure about wether or not a company that treats a new hire in this way, even during this pandemic, is one that I want to be working for.   While sitting at my desk with literally nothing to do I began browsing LinkedIn and came across a very intriguing job opening from another company with whom I had a chance to work with on a project during a Co-op in school.

{"prompt": "University stopped subscribing to Summon Search. How can I use my university credentials to access articles I find through Google Scholar? I used to find the Summon search very convenient as you can filter articles by author names, and much more. It has been replaced by EBSCO, which in my opinion is not as effective. I can search for journals and articles using Scholar but I cannot access it as I can only use my university credentials. Is there a way to do this? University staff has said I've got to use EBSCO and it's really bugging me.", "preferred": "In the upper right corner of the Google Scholar homepage, you'll see a little gear. Click on that to get to the setting page. About halfway down, you'll see \"Library Links\". Type in the name of your school and your library's citation linker should come up. Check it off and hit save. Now you should have links to full text in your Google Scholar results.  If this doesn't work, then talk to your library. They need to contact Google to get it set up.", "rejected": "Bearing in mind that Google Scholar will search beyond what you have access to through your University credentials, there are ways to route a link to an article through your school, assuming they use a proxy server for off campus access.  Go to libx.org and see if your school has a libx tool.  If they do, install it and it will let you route any link through your school's proxy.  If they don't, you'll have to manually prepend the proxy url in front of the article's url.  You can also ask your university librarians to set up a libx edition for your school.  Sadly, Summon is very expensive compared to EDS (Ebsco's product) so your library probably had to decide between keeping Summon or canceling journal subscriptions.  Alternately, you can keep EDS up in one tab, and search for citations you find in Scholar via EDS.  If you have access to the article via any database, EDS should find it for you."}
{"prompt": "Why is light affected by black holes? I know it's probably a very dumb question, but since light doesn't have mass, why is it affected by black holes? Aren't things attracted to black holes because of gravity?    Please don't start downvoting, for no reason. It's just a question.", "preferred": "Imagine, if you will, space is a nice big comfy king-sized bed. Put a 20 lb bowling ball in the middle, this will act as our black hole. You will almost immediately see how gravity affects 2D space (I think the hardest part with this question, when it comes to visualization, is that the human brain struggles to picture anything in more than 3 dimensions). Next take a ping pong ball or any other smaller ball (it's easier to see/imagine with a larger difference in mass) and roll it in the straightest path you can, slowly moving the path closer and closer to the bowling ball; this will represent photons passing by the black hole.  You'll notice a few things doing this experiment. The ping pong ball continues in a straight line unless it gets close enough for the bowling ball's 'gravity' to change its path (Newton). You'll also notice that there seems to be a certain diameter around the bowling ball that, no matter how you approach, the ping pong ball will never escape from the bowling ball (Schwarzschild).  As stated in GR, mass bends the spacetime around it. While photons aren't affected by time (their FOR is just nuts), they are absolutely affected by the space between source and receiver. This is evidenced by the Doppler Effect, which we use to gauge true distance to distant objects using the shift in light that source produces based on if it's moving toward or away from us. The light emitted from a moving source either shifts towards the blue spectrum (coming towards) or red spectrum (moving away). As Karl Schwarzschild theorized, there exists an invisible \"borderline\" to black holes, in which anything crossing that border can never escape, even light.  Black hole's name almost necessitates their effect on light. For further reading, gravity wells (or gravitational potential) would be a good place to start, maybe even just cursory stuff on the relativity 'boom' and the 40 or so years it took to get from photons to nuclear bombs.", "rejected": "In the Newtonian world, mass is the source of gravity, and masses instantaneously apply force to each other.   In General Relativity, energy (which mass is a form of) creates stress on space which warps it in a way that manifests as an attractive force. That stress propagates at the speed of light (as is the limit for any propagation) and not instantaneously.   The conversion factor between mass and energy is very large (c^2) so Newtonian gravity that only considers mass energy is a pretty good approximation for most things.  Here\u2019s an interesting thing: the Newtonian model very accurately predicts the orbits or planets. In fact, if we change the force a little we will get unstable orbits, where planets immediately fall into the sun or spiral into space, and don\u2019t have nice regular elliptical paths. Which is real and something we\u2019d definitely want a theory to confirm.   Planets have a lot of kinetic energy (they are big and are moving real fast) so when we switch to GR we would expect adding the energy component to increase the force of gravity and predict an unstable orbit (specifically, they\u2019d fall into the sun).   But there is a second effect to consider - the delay in propagation. The planet is moving but the force drags a little bit behind, pulling toward where the sun was a short time ago, not precisely where it is now. This is called \u201cframe dragging\u201d and it precisely cancels the kinetic energy component of GR. So that\u2019s why Newton\u2019s predictions were accurate and why planets don\u2019t fall into the sun."}
{"prompt": "Can you create a creme-brulee-like caramelized top for other desserts like for example a tiramisu? I love the caramelized sugar on top of a creme brulee (i just find it so satisfying to crack it open). I was wondering if you could do this style of caramelized top for other desserts served in individual portions. I tried this for a tiramisu by sprinkling it with sugar and using a blowtorch but the result wasn't as \"crackly\"... Therefore can you use this method for other desserts - OR what kind of desserts would work with it?", "preferred": "I brulee sugar on cheesecake, French toast, and brie. I'm positive there are other dishes that could benefit from having a caramelized sugar top.", "rejected": "You could get a dry sugar caramel taste without using a torch simply by slow toasting your sugar. Sugar can slowly caramelize without exposure to high heat, without even melting. See this:  # Serious Eats | Toasted Sugar Recipe  I think you could top your Tiramisu with this, and it would work great. The great thing about this method of getting a caramel flavor is that you avoid any burnt or smokey taste, just the pure caramel taste, since high temperatures are avoided."}

I didn't say anything about my current condition on the phone screen. I don't plan on trying to hide it in person, but what is the best way to meet this head on? If they were to offer me a job, I know I don't qualify for FMLA. Heck, I wouldn't even expect them to give me benefits off the bat. Should I offer to come on as a contractor until after I've had the baby? I want to show that I'm flexible, but I have no idea what HR or employers want to hear in this situation.", "preferred": "Given the fact that you ARE seven months pregnant, what is driving you to job hunt and interview now vs after you have the baby?  Are you experienced in your field and would require minimal training/onboarding, or will this be a career change?  Is there something particular about THIS role with THIS company that makes you uniquely qualified?  How big is the company, and how many people do this type of work there?  What's the seniority level of the role?  How quickly can you be back in the office after delivery?  How long if you need a c-section?  Are you prepared with childcare if you need to go back after a week?  (I can't fathom this, but since you're not protected by FMLA and will likely have minimal vacation accrued, I feel like it's important that you're asking yourself these questions.)  I think you should be prepared to proactively address most of what I've asked above.  The interviewers are almost certainly going to be caught off-guard and wondering why you're not waiting to apply until after you've had the baby.  They can't ask, so you should tell them (assuming the answer isn't I need any old job to get a few dollars before I deliver.)  You're going to be asking the company to take a significant chance on you, and while I'm not suggesting that you go hardcore TMI, just try to think about what you would be wondering if someone walked into an interview 7 months pregnant.  Big companies move slowly, and there's a decent chance that you could be 8+ months pregnant by the time they've made a decision.  Maybe this means that they can just set your start date for after delivery.  Stranger things have happened.    It's a tough one.  Good luck!", "rejected": ">Should I offer to come on as a contractor until after I've had the baby?   This is probably not possible.

{"prompt": "At the airport recently I saw a design for the winglet on the end of the wing I'd never seen before - one fin up, and one down. We have had at least 60 years of jet airplane design why hasn't the optimal wing design be found already?", "preferred": "There is no such thing as \"optimal\" wing design.  In general, as with literally every non-trivial optimization problem, there are a lot of different variables to change and a lot of different variables you might want to optimize.  For example: the best wing would be the lightest possible wing, that produces the most lift, and the least drag.  But of course these variables all affect each other; the lighter in absolute terms a wing is, generally the less lift it can produce; and lift and drag are related such that more lift inherently means more drag.   Substantial changes in material properties, advances in analysis techniques, and different definitions of \"optimal\" (e.g. do you want to maximize lift so you can carry heavy loads, or are you willing to sacrifice payload for fuel efficiency?) mean that every new aircraft gets its own analysis to determine the best way to build it.  There are rules of thumb for sizing fuselages and wings, but the details are always going to be different.    (Not to mention that tip devices like the one you're talking about don't have huge impacts on airplane performance even though they're highly visible.)", "rejected": "We don't even have a complete understanding of turbulent flow. We have models to predict behavior, but there are so many variables the real world accuracy can only be so absolute. Often times the equations result in non linear differential equations that require a PhD to solve. Simplifications can be had at the cost of accuracy. And what is optimal? It depends on the intended use and conditions which are variable. Optimal does not exist. Let alone the metrics of applying the design within cost and weight and what not."}

{"prompt": "Cmv: transgender women athletes have an advantage but the real problem is there is no good fix. So this is kinda a two parter that transgender women don't have an advantage in sports by the current U.S system which is 1 year on hormones. Then second part is that there is no fix that doesn't still negatively impact one group or another.  So my point that transgende women athletes have an advantage will focus on 2 major focuses first that there is enough evidence base on biological difference in men and women that transgender women will keep some advantage. The second is that studies are showing that a year is not enough time for the advantage to disappear.   The evidence for the difference is simple it has been confirmed that the leading women in the 400 meter run in thr Olympics who has more metals the Bolt has a top time of 49.2 seconds. I study has soon in the US alone 300 high-school boys would be able to beat this time. Showing that there is a connection in speed and gender. Another example and I think is the best is that we have title 9 to begin with this was the rule that created women sports if we needed to make a place for women to play fairly that shows there is a difference. There are also many scientific articles by this is going to be long enough and I think most people would argee to this point without much fighting.  Now for why the current system isn't better a new study that came out in 2020 in the Bmj ( British jourbal of medicine )Timothy A Roberts,\u00a0Joshua Smalley , and Dale Ahrendt took about 225 transgender athletes before starting and after a year of hormones. The research showed that the athletes still have about a 10% to 15%  difference between them and cis women now some would say they are within the numbers to compete in the women's category. Which is true but they would be top tier or at least jn the higher limits of women's level. Which some say is fair but for most things in sports they don't let you have any advantage even if it provides less results. The study then looked at the same people 3 years after hormones and found they were completely average. So yeah   Now here why no matter what goverment does someone is screwed. As seen if we are going on the current system the US ans Canada uses transgender women will have an unfair advantage in women's sports and there will he women who are negatively affected by this just for the fact that athletes play a large part in the American culture with scholarships and large corporations looking at them. So you are hurting the cis female community.   If we said sports go by sex then we create the same problem as now you have women who are taking transitioning to men playing with women and again advantage.   Some have said make a new league just for transgender but with different types of transitions it basically a wild and unstable system not to mention that the transgender community is small enough that alot of schools might not have the numbers to make a league.   Lasly I've seen well just make them do 3 years. And if we did that people would have to know they are transgender and start transitioning around 11 if they wanted to start at high-school and 14 if they wanted to play as a senior and that forces alot of pressure to know what you are now ans be comfortable on a time frame alot dont seem to be. Also again America doesn't seem to like the idea of people around 11 to 14 making that kinda of choice seem it as too early.", "preferred": ">but the real problem is there is no good fix.  There is.

{"prompt": "How likely is it for an engineering job/internship to reject an applicant because they wear dreadlocks? I am interested in entering an engineering career. Although I am willing to put in work necessary to become employed, I have heard that finding internships and/or employment during and after college can be very difficult. To add to that, I have dreadlocks and I fear that many employers would be less likely to hire me because of my hairstyle (note: my hair isn\u2019t wild or freeform. It\u2019s just average looking skinny dreadlocks that could be tied in a ponytail). How common is it for people to be fired or turned down from engineering positions due to certain hairstyles (dreadlocks or otherwise)?

This is changing, but I believe you should be familiar with the subtle signs people give off when judging your appearance. It does hurt to be turned away for these petty reasons; but consider that they are also diminishing their talent pool.   Certain industries have unwritten standards. For example, long hair is frowned upon in manufacturing because of increased risk of accidents. Full beards are not appreciated in roles where facial ppe is a must since they can make 'full seal' difficult. Sometimes you do have to adapt to the role.", "rejected": "Saving this for reference.

{"prompt": "Why are fusion reactors still 30 years away? Is the problem not being able to keep plasma hot or not being able to efficiently get energy out of it?", "preferred": "The problem is containing the plasma AND keeping it hot and dense enough for a self-sustained fusion reaction.  There actually is a key figure for assessing those properties. It's called the fusion product. If the fusion product is high enough, break-even is achieved/ or even more, energy can be gained than it was used. The progress is staggering, but the starting point was also very far away from break-even and any further improvements are getting more and more complicated.  The fusion product is calculated by multiplying the plasma temperature, density, and energy confinement time (very roughly comparable to a heat transfer coefficient)  Here is a nice graph for the progress being made regarding the fusion product:   https://www.anthropoceneinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/PWfus6\\_03-06-2.jpg  &#x200B;  On a side note:   Simply making the fusion reactor bigger helps. Because the plasma loses energy via the surface but gets energy via the chain reaction in proportion to the volume. If you know make the plasma donut bigger, the volume scales faster (cubic vs quadratic increase) and thus a better fusion product is achieved. Building bigger fusion reactors is a challenge in itself though. And not only technical, funding is, of course, also a problem.", "rejected": "Outside of my expertise, but the biggest problem is containing the plasma. We have to use a magnetic field to contain it because no material can contain plasma at temperature.   Keeping the plans in without losing too much heat is the core of the problem"}

{"prompt": "AskScience AMA Series: I am Dr. Laura Kloepper, a biologist who studies the emergence and echolocation dynamics of large bat cave colonies. This summer I am traveling and camping with two female students as we record bats across the Southwest. Ask Me Anything! Hi Reddit! I am Dr. Laura Kloepper, an Assistant Professor of Biology at Saint Mary's College in Notre Dame, Indiana. My research involves using audio, video, and thermal imagery to understand the emergence, flight, and echolocation dynamics of large (1 million +) colonies of Mexican Free-tailed bats. These bats leave the cave at densities of up to 1,000 bats per second, flying at speeds of 25 mph, beating their wings ten times per second, and rarely run into each other. Their primary mode of navigation is using echolocation, or making a loud sound and using the information in the echoes to create a visual representation of their surroundings. Everything we know about biology, mathematics and physics says that they should not be able to successfully echolocate in these large groups. My main research involves trying to understand how they are able to successfully navigate via echolocation without interfering with one another, and these findings have technological implications to improve man-made sonar. I am also interested in flight dynamics in large groups, factors that control the emergence timing, and unique characteristics of bat guano.  This summer I am traveling with two female undergraduate students and my trusty field dog as we visit 8 caves across the Southwest to tackle multiple research projects. We will be doing a lot of camping, consuming a lot of canned food, and putting close to 7,000 miles on our rental SUV.

{"prompt": "CMV: Human civilization will collapse within my lifetime because our political/financial systems are not equipped to address climate change. A warning at the outset: if you\u2019re prone to anxiety and depression, especially about existential risk and/or the impacts of climate change, please take care of yourself and maybe avoid this discussion entirely.  Throwaway because talking about this makes me feel like a crazy person. Sorry about all the links, but it sounds even more deranged without citations (and maybe I\u2019ve misinterpreted some of them and your clarifications will persuade me).  I have a BS in environmental sciences (quant heavy), and a large fraction of a PhD in bioinformatics. So while not any kind of expert, I like to think I'm scientifically and statistically literate, especially in the relevant fields of ecology, evolution, energy and sustainability; and generally I have experience in scientific critical thinking and data interpretation.  There are four major points that have convinced me we are on an irreversible path to destruction.  **1. Our models are right on track.**  * The IPCC reports and models have been pretty accurate thus far, and check out the first graph in this BBC article \u2013 observed temperatures track (or exceed) their simulations. * These models predict we'll reach a temperature increase of 3.2C this century, even if we meet current emissions goals (that we\u2019re not meeting). * At a 2C rise, food production is significantly down, dangerous and extreme weather are worse, and sea levels increase by a predicted 50cm. I can\u2019t find a neat infographic to describe the destruction at 3C, but here\u2019s a depressing list of cities expected to be submerged. (N.B: we're currently at 1.2C above pre-industrial levels, so imagine what the fires and flooding will look like in a few years)  **2. We haven\u2019t even been trying to model tipping points and equilibrium shifts.**  * Our models are only accurate thus far because we haven\u2019t fully activated any tipping points yet (at least to a visibly exponential phase). * Don't forget about all those recent articles about the slowing of AMOC/the Gulf Stream, the collapse of which would have huge and sudden implications for weather across the globe. * On top of that, reduction in emissions leads to immediate warming, as we saw in spring 2020 due to COVID shutdowns. When we do eliminate emissions, our aerosol pollution shield won\u2019t be around anymore, thus we\u2019re already about 1C deeper than anyone\u2019s acknowledging. * Add together that scientists think we\u2019ll start activating irreversible tipping points at 1.5-2C, and we\u2019re already locked into 2.5+C within a few decades? Yikes.  **3. The way our financial systems work is to create money through debt on the assumption of future productivity. This assumes monotonic, often exponential growth of value produced by humans.**  * In the context of climate change, this is a death sentence - banks are not allowed to conceive of a world in which growth does not continue. So financial incentives cannot value degrowth. So everyone keeps depleting resources and emitting more carbon, GDP is up up up, even though everyone would be much better off if it...wasn't like that. * Optimists point out that plenty of our resources are clean and renewable, but I assume the transition into those systems will take decades. We don\u2019t have decades to continue emissions at this level. * It gets even dicier when you add in the effects of governments and citizens hemorrhaging money and resources due to wildfires, flooding, freshwater shortages, famine, sea-level rise and refugee crises, mass unemployment and citizen revolts. As these events happen with increasing frequency across the globe and start piling up on each other, the insurance industry doesn\u2019t stand a chance and the banks are not far behind.  **4. Too many humans suck really bad at confronting global catastrophe, see COVID-19.**  * The situation got out of hand because of a cover-up (ExxonMobil / Wuhan govt) * Surprise, it got worse because of media and government denial that it was an issue worth taking seriously (COVID downplayed in the US until it was unmanageable / fully one half of Americans in 2015 did not agree that temperatures are rising due to human activity) * Even when consequences became clear, the situation continued to devolve due to the actions of a subset of idiots refusing to enforce scientifically-proven mitigation strategies (NC banned a study on sea level rise / eight states have banned vaccination and mask mandates)  Some of my examples above are specific to the US, but unfortunately everyone is forced to share an atmosphere with us. So I feel that the only realistic way of saving the earth in time is a combination of mass revolt (like supernationally-coordinated grassroots terrorism to sabotage corporations with the biggest non-essential GHG emissions), really dangerous geoengineering projects (e.g. aerosols in the atmosphere to reflect sunlight a la Snowpiercer), and the introduction of financial measures that are unthinkable or wildly unpopular right now (best example I\u2019ve heard of is carbon sequestration as basis for a new currency).  I don\u2019t deny that those things could save us, if we act now. I would like to point out that\u2026we aren\u2019t acting now, even as the visible effects of climate change continue to worsen at ever increasing rates. I argue that our inevitable failure is baked into the system. In the political sphere, geriatric obstructionists will continue to be elected for the next decade at least, and inconvenient (but absolutely necessary!) solutions will not be politically tractable until it's way too late. Similarly, in the financial sphere, people with the power to change things are locked into the current status quo that enriches them and the shareholders they\u2019re accountable to. It\u2019s not like these billionaires are oblivious either \u2013 they know what\u2019s coming. Their solution is to build private bunkers.   **TLDR:** By my estimation, most likely is the outcome where things will get worse, as we\u2019ve been seeing for the past 5 years or so; and the rate of things getting worse will become exponential, much as our emissions have been (and remember we\u2019re currently only seeing the effects from gasses emitted ten years ago in 2011 (39Gt), and we\u2019ve been emitting more ever since (up to 43Gt in 2019), the effects of which won\u2019t be seen til 2040); our fragile web of supply chains will buckle; people will be dying and willing to die to save the earth before those in power are willing to change; and so there will be massive uprisings to upset the status quo, which sounds \u201cnice\u201d being that it\u2019s necessary, but will ultimately lead to instability and infighting and the consequent inability to address any problems but our own civil wars, as hundreds of millions die in wet bulb 35 heatwaves, arable temperatures move away from existing infrastructure to produce food, drought and desertification worsen, billions more die by famine while nation states collapse under the pressure of climate refugees and civil war, kinship communities pop up where they can eke out a living for a few generations. All by 2120 I\u2019d guess, based on the literature linked throughout this post. Many journalists and scientists agree with my estimate \u2013 give this 2017 Intelligencer article a read if you really want to get fucked up today.  I'd put it at 70% likelihood that \"first world\" nations will start collapsing like dominos in my lifetime (i.e. the next 50 years). Anecdotally: a small but concerning subset of my fellow scientist friends are getting Weird. Prepper levels of weird, buying land for a homestead in Wisconsin levels of weird.

When food security becomes scarcer, it will also be more lucrative, so we'll see much more investment towards sustainable farming.  >banks are not allowed to conceive of a world in which growth does not continue  This is a myth. The Japanese economy hasn't grown for 3 decades and they're still doing fine.  Without a doubt, a lot of people are going to die due to climate change, but civilization collapse is a very high bar to set. Civilization survived both world wars. China and Russia survived their great famines. The average life expectancy in the world in the century before those tragedies was less than 40. The relatively comfortable life you live right now was made possible because we extracted work out of fossil fuels. For now, climate change will only cause a regression of living standards back to the mean.

{"prompt": "CMV: Bernie Sanders is a hypocrite. 1. Bernie Sanders owns several houses, including a beach house. When asked about it, he said \"I wrote a best-selling book. If you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too.\" This logic isn't very different from a CEO who says they started a company, and if you start a successful company, you can be a millionaire too. You could argue that companies exploit employees, but then why is criticism levied against companies that use robots? You could also say being a millionaire and billionaire (or trillionaire) are all vastly different amounts of money. But from the perspective of an American living on $20,000 a year or someone in a developing country living on $2 a day, it\u2019s an insane amount of money anyway you look at it. As a millionaire who has been a political leader for decades, Sanders is the establishment.  2. Bernie Sanders didn't pay his staff a $15/hour minimum wage. He paid them a flat salary, but made them work over 60 hours a week. He played hardball with the union when they asked for an increase in wages until one of them leaked the story to the Washington Post. It was only after he risked voter backlash that he raised the wage. Or more accurately, he kept their wage the same, but cut their hours and replaced them with unpaid volunteers. When asked about the union going public, he said: \u201cIt does bother me that people are going outside of the process and going to the media...That is really not acceptable. It is really not what labor negotiations are about, and it\u2019s improper.\u201d Some of his staff left, and the others have gotten what they want. I\u2019m not sure if they had to sign non-disclosure agreements, but in any case, they don\u2019t want to criticize him because it undermines their efforts to get him elected.  But I believe the way this unfolded undermines future unions.  4. Sanders regularly flies on private jets, aside from the occasional times he flies coach for the photo op. When asked about it he says: \"The carbon footprint? As opposed to what?...We are trying to get around Iowa and get around the country as best we can. So we have a lot of people to see and that is the best way can do it.\" To his credit, he has said he will pay for carbon offsets in the future. But he frequently criticizes billionaires who also fly private jets to get to meetings quickly and pay for carbon offsets.  4. Sanders oversaw a culture of sexism and sexual harassment on his 2016 campaign trail, according to his female staffers. To his credit, he has apologized for his errors from 3 years ago. Yet Sanders frequently criticizes fellow candidates for similar errors from even several decades ago. Furthermore, though Sanders has apologized, there are rumors that the so called \"Bernie Bro\" culture continues to persist.  Feel free to respond to any or all arguments. The only argument that won\u2019t convince is me is the classic \u201cBut Trump is a hypocrite too!\u201d \u201cWarren is a hypocrite too!\u201d Yes, I know, but this post is about Bernie Sanders in particular.   Also, I don\u2019t particularly care to discuss Bernie\u2019s policies. For example, Bernie Sanders is the most [anti-immigrant candidate running besides Trump.]( https://time.com/4170591/bernie-sanders-immigration-conservatives/ ) But his stated goal is to limit immigration, and he seems to promote that.

He\u2019s a front runner for the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination for president of the United States. He has to travel a lot and is probably working 20 hours a day. Of course he\u2019s flying private jet. Assuming otherwise would just be naive... It\u2019s inevitable - so I honestly fail to see what the issue is.  4. You should be really careful with unsubstantiated media reports about the inner workings of Sanders\u2019 campaign. The NYT\u2019s coverage (not even commentary) is notoriously biased against him for example. The Bernie bros narrative emerged and gained traction particularly because liberals wanted to highlight that Clinton is a woman and Bernie isn\u2019t. In fact his base is younger and more diverse than that of other candidates - particularly Warren btw.  1. I\u2019m viscerally opposed to arguments along this line. It always reminds me of the Russel Brand quote: \u201cWhen I was poor and complained about inequality they said I was bitter; now that I'm rich and I complain about inequality they say I'm a hypocrite. I'm beginning to think they just don't want to talk about inequality.\u201d Of course it can be problematic when politicians live very different lives from the people they\u2019re representing. But Bernie? Seriously, *Bernie*? The guy isn\u2019t some corporate ghoul or bought lobbyist like many other politicians. He just has some real estate and a savings account. That doesn\u2019t make him a hypocrite. He genuinely believes in his redistributive ideals - always has and always will.", "rejected": "I\u2019m not really sure how making a million dollars in and of itself makes him a hypocrite. It would be one thing if he turned around and changed his stance on raising that tax bracket, or if he made the money in a way that was particularly inimical to his policies - like selling payday loans or something. But I don\u2019t think Sanders is against people making money, he just wants them to be highly taxed past a certain income threshold."}

{"prompt": "Discussing Stagnant PhD Stipends I've been talking with my fellow PhD students recently about grad student pay, specifically why its viewed as normal to be so much less than minimum wage. We are at a supposedly top-tier Canadian research university in a city where the official poverty line is now >$28,000, roughly equal to full-time minimum wage, but our program's minimum stipends are $17,000 (which is actually LOWER than it was 5 years ago). Many of us don't get additional pay despite winning fellowships (I get 20k/year from external funds and not an extra cent from my lab), and because we're in a graduate-only program there are no classes to TA for extra money. We are only required to take 16 credits for the entire program so we are very much expected to be spending at least 40 hours / week in the lab.   There's a common sentiment that we are having to make greater and greater sacrifices to survive on these wages - cutting out meals, moving into seriously sub-standard housing, taking out loans. Part-time jobs are also forbidden by the program (students have been threatened with expulsion for taking jobs), and spending time on things other than our research feels like it will ruin our career chances. The burden also feels worse as the average time to graduate is >5 years, and will certainly be longer for us due to covid, meaning those of us who did MSc's beforehand will be 30 with at least half a decade of lab experience, but will still be paid the same as new students almost a decade ago. With the rapidly increasing cost of living, lengthening degree durations, and awful career prospects for graduates, I believe the current stipend is unsustainable and unjustified.  I brought these points up (as well as the fact that I've brought in over $80 000 in fellowships) with my PI and asked for a raise and he tentatively agreed, but he has brushed me off every time I've tried to bring it up the past few weeks and I'm getting increasingly agitated. I absolutely need him as a reference so I feel I have no leverage, as is the case for most students.      I'm curious how this compares with other students' situations as it seems like PhDs are better off in other countries, and the perspective of PIs as to whether low student stipends are still justified. If anyone has examples of successful campaigns to increase stipends, or relevant statistics or other readings, that would also be great. We don't have a student union but are currently recruiting as many students as we can to a Facebook group to share information and grievances, and hopefully organize some action in the future.", "preferred": "I can only speak from an American perspective, but I am sure the Canadian academic situation has the same problem. A big obstacle is that NSF/NIH grants haven't really increased over time (in fact, the NIH modular grant has been $250,000 for over 2 decades, giving you a 2021 purchasing power that is ~50% of your 2001 purchasing power). As a result, PIs have only a couple of options with respect to trainee salaries:  1. Increase salaries but hire less trainees (decreasing scientific output) 2. Increase salaries and obtain more grants  3. Maintain salaries and try to survive while inflation chips away at everything else.   Unfortunately, most PIs (by choice or, more often, by circumstance) choose option #3.  What I have noticed is that many of the \"top\" institutions (by whatever metric you want to choose) have been slowly but surely increasing trainee salary (Columbia graduate students in STEM can make well over $40k if you include summer stipends) and providing subsidizing housing for their PhD students. I expect this to continue for those types of institutions while the \"other\" institutions get left behind. I think we can all agree this bifurcation of graduate education is not a good thing but it seems rather inevitable at this point.   The only options graduate students have is to *not* join institutions that do not pay their trainees a living wage, or to join a union. Unfortunately, I think there are limits to joining a union due to external funding difficulties.", "rejected": "As a reference: in Austria, where I did my PhD, PhD students are usually employed under a collective agreement contract as a \"project assisstant\", but officially only 30h / week. This still amounts to \\~30k \u20ac (\\~45k CAD) per year before tax/social insurance. So, luckily, fairly decent for PhD. In Austria we have very strong unions (in this case, not only for students, but for all university employees), which is why these collective agreements are possible. I don't know the situation in Canada, but I guess that similar agreements via unions (for university of public sector in general) would be ideal."}

I also very highly recommend watching his film *The Perverts Guide to Ideology*, currently available here, and not just watching it easily like a normal film, but approaching it the same way you would approach a book: https://archive.org/details/2013ThePervertsGuideToIdeology (you might have to scroll down to '12' on the list below the player to get to it).", "rejected": "I would try to understand Hegels idea about the dialectic, Lacans theories of the self, the real and the imaginary, and marx.

{"prompt": "CMV: Liberals should abandon identity politics and instead focus on class/economic issues Identity Politics (IP) is largely unhelpful and extremely divisive. The focus on identity by liberals alienates other people on the left and creates huge distance from those in the middle and those on the right. Class/economic issues, such as wealth inequality and ending crony capitalism, are far more unifying messages for those who hold liberal ideology. Alleviating class/economic issues would also have downstream positive impact on many other issues (often championed by IP) such as racial inequality.  Proponents of IP get caught up too often in the characteristics of the individuals making political arguments \u2013 practically by design. The speaker therefore is weighted according to inherent traits they happened to be born with (race, gender, sexual orientation). This creates an environment in which large portions of the population/electorate (i.e. straight, white, male) feel that their opinions and issues are valued less than others. The resulting atmosphere, exacerbated deliberately by right leaning talking points, causes many to abandon the left.  Class/economic issues should become the leading message for liberals, given the broader appeal it would naturally have. Discussing and championing issues of income distribution/poverty/corruption would reach a much larger population and could pull many in the middle and on the right back toward the left. This would not only be practically useful for political reasons, but would also have a net positive impact on many of the class-related social issues that we see in society.     _____  > *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

The left today always lament that some poor people \"vote against their self-interest\" and patronize them like they're idiots.  It never occurs to them that some people would rather vote according to principle that advances the general welfare rather than vote to put money into their own pockets, and that maybe it's worthwhile to ENCOURAGE that type of civic philosophy rather than mock it.

I live in the US, and apparently our desserts here are notorious for being very sweet, or even overly sweet. To me, it's \"normal sweet\", most of the time, but it seems that for most people from the UK or AU (where else?) are disgusted by this level of sweetness. So I am wondering why this is the case. Are desserts in these other countries not normally this sweet?   When I think of dessert, it's something that *should* be very sweet, but also eaten in small amounts, and enjoyed in moderation. Certainly not something you eat every day. So I also wonder if desserts are typically eaten more often in these other countries? Is it an everyday thing? Do you eat larger portions?  I'm really curious to hear from people that have experience with both US-based desserts, and UK-based desserts. I don't know anyone here in the US who has ever reduced sugar in recipes by huge amounts, or complained about something being overly sweet.

Later, in the same movie, he trapped Dormammu in a time loop and did battle with him, over and over again. As a result, his battle prowess increased exponentially, and his skill as a Sorcerer approaches, and possibly surpasses, the Ancient One herself.  In *Infinity War*, Strange enters another time loop, and experiences 14 million plus battles with Thanos. Using the Time Stone, he tried literally everything he could think of.  And some of those attempts almost certainly involved opening a portal back to Earth, in order to escape from Thanks, hide the Time Stone, or summon reinforcements.

There's also reportedly been a lot of cases at least in this election cycle of people who cast their ballot all red except for President, for whom they voted blue.

{"prompt": "Post-doc Here: Department wants me to become a tenure-track Assistant Professor after one year of being a post-doc. Not entirely invested in this University. What do I do?? I'm a post-doc, just received my PhD in June 2018. I just relocated to start a post-doc in September 2018....by October 2018, the faculty requested me to apply for a tenure-track faculty position. I was advised to start sending out applications, even though its relatively early for me, because I never know what I could find....so in sending out other applications, I also submitted an application for the department I'm currently in.   However, I'm noticing a trend. The department chair keeps laying work on my plate at the last minute, undermining my current focuses (I would like to focus on publishing and developing the one course I'm set to teach).

If I'm honest, I'm not entirely invested in this particular institution. My post-doc appointment is supposed to last for two years...and only a month after I've started, I'm already being rushed to apply for a faculty position. If I had the choice, I don't want to plant my roots where I currently am because I would prefer to be at another university in another location. Despite this, I can appreciate the offer to move into the tenure-track professoriate....but it all feels rushed, and it doesn't feel like I'm able to do what I came here to.   I'm tempted to decline the offer (as it sounds increasingly likely that they will make one to me).

{"prompt": "I'm making my own wedding cakes! Some questions. Note: this is not happening for at least a year, possibly longer! I am just a compulsive planner and I want to have all my ducks in a row well before it becomes relevant. Now that the wedding is officially *on* I want to start thinking about it.  So I always knew I wanted to bake my own wedding cake. It sounds insane to a lot of people but baking soothes me and feeding people the things I make brings me more joy than almost anything in the world. I don't exactly trust my cake-stacking abilities though, so rather than making a tiered cake I'm going to make three separate cakes. It's a small wedding so 3 10-inch cakes should get everyone at least one piece. My plan was to do one cake my choice, one my partner's choice, and one we choose together. I'll do as much as possible ahead of time, and I'm not fussed about decorations over it tasting good so I'm not worrying too much about being able to do a bunch of delicate flower piping or whatever.  Anyway, questions! I'm sure I'll have much more to ask when I get much closer to the day but this is just some preliminary stuff.  1. What sorts of frosting are particularly stable/unstable?  2. Relatedly: is it even possible to use whipped cream for a wedding cake? My favorite cake is a Victoria sponge but I'm not sure that's a realistic choice.  3. I know typically the cake rounds are baked at least a few days ahead of time, to be filled and frosted the day before or day of the wedding. Are there any types of cake that don't stand up well to being frozen? I imagine some delicate cakes like angel's food would be ruined in the process.  4. In general, what absolutely *cannot* be done prior to the day of the wedding? Like, in theory, would it be possible for me to finish all three cakes, have them in the fridge, and just bring them to the venue and be done with it? Or are there parts of the process that really need to happen on-site?  5. Finally, this one is just a matter of taste but: are there any flavors/cake types you can think of that would be particularly unpopular? I don't really want to do a basic white or chocolate cake but my tastes can be eclectic and I don't want to do something that it turns out no one likes but me!   Thanks for reading! I'm a bit overenthusiastic about this right now if that isn't clear.", "preferred": "Without knowing where and what type of and distance to venue. At which time of year etc, no one knows what to tell you. And telling you everything to cover all possibilities with plan B contingencies is overwhelming.  In the right conditions you can make anything.   What you can do now is start making practice cakes,  get it down. Give the cakes away after tasting them.  What sort of baking skill do you possess, have you a mixer. ?", "rejected": "First, a ten inch cake will give you about 30-35 servings. Wedding cake servings are smaller than party cake, but you cut them cake in a grid to get smaller, thin rectangular slices. Wedding cakes are typically tall - 6-8 inches tall or sometimes even taller, so even a 1x2\" slice is a decent amount of cake.    If you don't want to buy or rent a tiered cake stand, get some small boxes (big enough to support the stands) and arrange then under the table cloth of they're ugly or over if they're pretty so you get a variety of height and can get them closer together so they look more like one cake.  1) Italian buttercream is the most stable buttercream after an American buttercream with shortening (but that one tastes like crap) and tastes best at room temperature.  It can also be made in advance and frozen. You just need to thaw and refresh.  French buttercream is lovely and delicate and a pain in the butt. Ermine icing can be fairly stable but is softer overall and can't be made very far ahead. Since you aren't decorating, it could be a sub for the whipped cream since it's much lighter. It does fine for icing but trying to make a rose out of it is an exercise in frustration. If you want to do a cream cheese (those also may need to refrigerated for safety), cut it half and half with American buttercream for stability.  2) Stabilize your whipped cream with gelatin and it'll last for an hour or two at in inside reception. Don't try it if you'll be outside. (Leaving it out too long is also a health hazard, even if it doesn't melt.)  3) Pretty much any cake will freeze. Honestly, I don't think I've ever had a cake not freeze. Angel food cake cannot be frosted, but it could be pretty filled with fresh fruit and whipped cream rosettes. You could put a dish with more fruit and cream out.   4)You can finish the cake completely before hand since you aren't stacking. Do a swirly finish with a spatula and finish on site with fresh flowers, cut figs, berries, etc. (For flowers, wrap the stems in floral tape and insert a piece of a bubble straw cut to the length of the flower into the cake first, then insert the flower into the straw. You can tape together small bunches. Don't use anything toxic and try to source pesticide free flowers.) You can add the garnish off site, but you'll likely need to fix whatever rolled off on the drive over anyway. If you have a moderately artistic friend or family member, you can insert the straws and pretape your flowers and have them finish for you.  5) savory combos like basil lemon are probably the most \"controversial\". It's hard to say without knowing how eclectic your tastes are.  Making your own wedding cake adds a lot of stress, but if you practice the cakes, do as much as you can in advance, and recruit some help, it is doable. Good luck!"}

{"prompt": "If an Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Device disrupts electrical interactions, why is the human body/nervous system unaffected? Or, if it is affected, in what way?", "preferred": "Weaponized EMP is one of the most wildly misunderstood and completely misrepresented concepts in fiction (not to say that EMP isn't fiction, but how it's portrayed in fiction is).  First you have to understand what an antenna is. If you take a length of conductors of a certain length (the element) and run an electrical oscillation through it at a certain frequency, it will transmit radio waves. They also work in the other direction - shot an oscillating frequency at it and it will induce an electrical current. The size of the antenna is directly related to the frequency of the transmission - if you want to transmit on a very low frequency, you need an extremely large antenna. The cables you see on the tails of many cargo aircraft, like this CP-130, aren't there for stability or structural reasons - they're actually HF antennas. HF has a wavelength between 10 and 100 meters, so you need an acceptably large antenna to receive and transmit.   There are ways around some of these limitations, in the form of half- and quarter-wave dipoles, but I'm not going to go into that here.  Note that this is also why the 'stealth-killer' concept of VHF radar isn't actually a serious threat, but I'm not going to go into that either unless asked.  This is why electric circuits running wiring in parallel can induce frequencies in each other, putting your cellphone next to speakers can cause buzzing, or any other example of electromagnetic interference (EMI).  In a nutshell, the reason EMP takes out electrical grids is because it induces high voltages into *power lines*. The reason for this is because the wavelengths of a weaponized EMP can span a huge part of the EM spectrum and become very, very long, and what happens is that things begin to act like antennas. Since power lines - especially high-tension power lines - are unshielded (it would be cost and weight prohibitive to shield them), they absorb the EMP and induce a lot of oscillating currents in them. This manifests at either end of the power line as unstable voltage and can damage and destroy sensitive equipment.  On the other hand, this generally means that small electronics and small lengths of conduit aren't going to be affected by EMP! In military aircraft, such as nuclear bombers, there's a lot of EMP shielding in them, but most of this EMP shielding is only on wires of a certain length, because shorter wavelengths are more quickly absorbed by the atmosphere and aren't as damaging. By weight, the vast majority of wiring isn't hardened against EMP because they really don't need to be. Everything small is grounded to the chassis which functionally serves as a faraday cage and is sufficient protection.  This means that the silly scene in *Broken Arrow* where his watch stops working probably wouldn't happen. Nor would you holographic gunsights in Call of Duty stop working.  In the human body, without something that can function as an antenna, the EMP is completely harmless and passes right through you like any other radio wave does.", "rejected": "The 'electrical' signals in a body are *chemical* electrical potentials, which are closer to a battery than a circuit. You can't disrupt those chemicals and change their electrical potential as easily as you can in electronics because they are just too slow to release their charge. If electrons are water, chemical potential is like wet sand.   Not only are cells not as conductive as metals (and so less sensitive to electric fields or EMP) but they are also basically all universally grounded. Each electrical signal is a floating voltage, and only exists as a potential between those two cells with different ion concentrations. Your body is ten billion tiny bags of water, which overall are the same voltage."}

Over the counter drugs typically reduce pain by reducing the cause of the pain. Swelling for example, causes pain. Reduce the swelling and the pain will be lessened. This method doesn't work when the source of the pain is extreme, like you've just recently been cut open.  Prescription drugs typically reduce pain by turning off your pain receptors in your nerves, either at the source of the pain or in your brain.

Opiate pain killers work by stimulating the 'feel good' receptors. No matter how much tylenol you take you can never get a 'feel-good' sensation.

Ibuprofen is an anti-inflammatory and has no psychological effects, it just reduces swelling which is a large cause of many pains.   All of these drugs are deadly at their respective lethal-dose."}

Now getting into detail, it depends on what you mean by \"basic science.\" Elementary school science doesn't touch on vaccines and climate change much at all. Highschool goes into it more in depth, but it stops being quite so basic at a certain point, and quite frankly, I wouldn't expect an elected official to have to know the phases of the moon, for example, so an all-encompassing science test would not be ideal, and it's a bit much to expect them to know the details of every scientific subject that may become a policy issue, as you or I certainly aren't educated on all of those things. Today it's vaccines, tomorrow it could be fault lines and plate tectonics. The relevancy of these subjects changes and the necessary information changes. In light of this a pro-active test would not be nearly as effective as reactive research and review as a scientific matter becomes relevant.      You also demonstrate a fundamental lack of understanding of the abortion argument, made obtuse through the lens of a personal bias. It isn't about anatomy at all, it's about ethics. People on the right argue that it is not acceptable to end a human life under these circumstances and people on the left argue that the right to bodily autonomy makes it an acceptable exception.      The claim that Republicans would be disproportionately disadvantaged by this illuminates a clear political bias here, which would be okay- as we're all politically biased- if it didn't lead to you making dubious claims with an intent to insult one side rather than have a conversation. This reads like you saying \"Republicans are dumb and ignorant to scientific fact\" and not like \"I think that the education requirements for elected officials are too low currently.\"", "rejected": ">I understand that this would probably hurt the republicans more than the democrats  oh really you think so. i am Canadian we have a young prime minster (not an old fart) with left political views ( not a republican) . and a first year of collage flunky (doesn't meet your criteria).  and about climate change. education has little to do with whether you believe it or not. it is about your personality . are you a skeptical person or not and to what degree. you will probably find out that the percentage of people who believe in it among the uneducated is exactly the same as the percentage among the educated.  i might be skeptical about climate change but at least i have a degree in electrical engineering unlike my prime minister .

When they woke me up in the office I was extremely belligerent and was thrashing around and screaming like crazy. When I got home I punched my husband in the face and tore apart our entire apartment in a fit of rage (I am NOT a ragey person). Then I passed out on the ground. Husband called 911. Paramedics brought me to hospital. I got 4 of narcan, no response. Smelling salts not much of a response. Then woke up lated and was belligerent again in the ER, refused to let them do head CT, I was screaming about being raped. I got admitted for observation. I woke up in the middle of the night, went to the bathroom, got dizzy and passed out again. They did head CT and it was normal. The next morning I had paranoid delusions, I was convinced the FBI was monitoring me and they were going to take away my daughter, paranoid the nurses were poisoning me, ect. I ran away from my room and it took them an hour to find me. Then they gave me olanzapine and I slept for like 20 hours straight. Woke up normal with very little memory of what happened. ....so my question is how the hell did general anesthesia do this to me?  I have been under general anesthesia about 5 times in the past for various procedures and this did not happen. I had another dental procedure 3 weeks prior with somewhat similar results. I did a root canal under moderate IV sedation and while I have no memory of it, the dentist told me I was fighting them the entire time, hence why we did general anesthesia for the second root canal. I do not have a history of violence other than during these two root canals.   These are the meds I was given according to the anesthesiologist: 15mg midazolam PO, Once IV was started, you got 150mcg fentanyl and 20mcg dexmedetomidine titrated, 150mg propofol for induction, You got another 100mg propofol after intubation because you were bucking on the tube, 10mg dexamethasone. Most of these meds between 1:07 to about 1:20. Sevoflurane maintenance until about 2:30 and toward the end I gave you another 25 mcg fentanyl and 15 mcg dexmedetomidine to do awake extubation, Along with 4mg ondansetron  I will need more dental work in the future but both of my experiences with anesthesia for dental treatment has been, well, horrific. Moving forward I'm terrified this will happen again. What could have caused this? What in anesthesia makes people go psychotic?

It's possible one of these will end up successful, particularly if the US military continues to be interested in it for powering remote stations in the artic.

Obviously China exporting nuclear power around the world will get some people pause politically, but I'd point out they've played a huge role in reducing the costs of solar panel manufacturing.

Probably the best solution is to focus on maintaining existing nuclear power facilities while ramping up wind, solar, electricity storage, and perhaps eventually carbon capture and sequestration.   Nuclear is expensive to build, and the process to get a nuclear power plant takes decades. The new reactors at the Vogtle plant in Georgia are the only current construction and have been in planning for \\~15 years already and won't be producing electricity until at least 2021, if it ever does. Perpetual delays and cost overruns continuously threaten whether it will actually be completed. With serious effort and government support, this could undoubtedly be improved, but the political challenges for that are enormous and the economics still wouldn't be great.  In contrast, wind and solar are relatively cheap to build and can (and have) been deployed very quickly. The quick deployment is essential because we need to start abating emissions now if we want to have any hope at reaching targets like limiting to 2 degrees of warming.   While wind and solar do have their own problem - intermittency - it should be generally able to be handled in the near-to-mid term with existing technologies. Once wind and solar are the dominant sources of electricity, new technical development and overcoming serious political hurdles regarding building transmission lines will be needed. However, this development is already underway with technologies like batteries and carbon capture both showing significant promise to be ready when needed.   I'm really not sure why you consider nuclear to be the only feasible option at this point. It is certainly technically feasible, but economically and politically it is not. I contrast, wind and solar are economically feasible (and trending downward in cost), nearly technically feasible (with handling intermittency being the only real remaining long term challenge), and also politically feasible (even in a hostile political climate under Trump, large scale deployment has continued)."}

{"prompt": "I think I am being investigated by a higher law enforcement agency for stuff that distant relatives are doing. So I have been kind of paranoid for the last few days and I am unsure of how to proceed.   Since Monday of two weeks ago someone has been parking a black panel van outside my house and followed me to work.   When I say follow I mean the van would remain where it was until I got to work. However when I would go out for lunch it would be in the parking lot. At first I assumed coincidence until I saw the car outside of the grocery store one day when I had spent over 2 hours in the store talking with a friend of mine who works there.   I wrote down the plate number and went home. Next morning the van across the street had the same plate number as the one from the grocery store. I live in a kind of small town so I figured it could still be a coincidence; until I left for lunch that day and saw the van had the same plate number.   Now I knew something was up. I called a friend of mine asking if he were playing a joke on me. His uncle owns a plumbing business and uses black vans with vinyl clings on them. I thought that maybe they hadn't branded the van yet and he were just screwing with me. He told me it was not him but asked me what the license plate was. He wanted to see if it was an old van they no longer used.   When I told him the plate number he made a big deal about the plate only having numbers and no letters on it. He thought I were screwing with him until I showed him the pictures of van outside my house and work.   Side note. I will not be sharing these pictures as they are very clearly identifiable with the landmarks in the background.   He told me to call the police immediately. I talked to an officer over the phone and told him what was happening. He made a big deal about the license plate only having numbers on it and did not believe me. I just asked him if he could send a car by my place. He reluctantly agreed and thought I was bullshitting him. The next day the van was gone.  Two days later there is a white SUV with dark tint on the windows. This SUV is also following me around and is being more aggressive. I started carrying my gun in my car just in case because of it but I have been advised against it.  I think it is a police van and SUV that has been following me as they both have license plates that have no letters in it. Looking up online it looks like, in Texas, license plates that only have numbers belong to the police. I have been unable to confirm that as the police dept has been very terse with me. They told me that if I wanted to get them involved in this issue I should come down and talk about it at the station with them.   Yeah I am definitely not gonna do that. My friend told me to contact a lawyer immediately as it is likely I am being investigated by some LEA that is not my local department as they did not know anything about the black van at first.   I have family who are, well lets just say that we have a small herd of black sheep in our family. They live in NJ and are involved in a lot of illegal things. We will leave it at that.   My familial connections with them has precluded me from getting a security clearance in the past to work for a major US military contractor and has created issues at airports.

{"prompt": "We are in our most natural state as children. It is the job of educators, parents, governments, and other authority figures to beat the shit out of your inner child, so they can turn you into a mindless zombie who acts out some absurd idea of \"this is what an adult is supposed to do.\" CMV. Why are children so joyful and carefree, while adults are often such miserable sacks of anxiety, depression, or some other form of psychosis? I believe that decades of learned repression are responsible. It all starts in the classroom with \"Sit down Johnny, stop throwing that pencil at Suzy!\" But after being told over and over that acting on your desires is unacceptable, you need to shut up and do your work, you learn to repress those desires. \"Yes, yes, I do really want to do this work. I want to get this A.\" In a sense, you learn to create in your mind a little teacher that is yelling at you to stop being an immature brat and instead be \"responsible.\" \"Growing up\" is the process of fully identifying with that little teacher you've created, so that you do the \"responsible\" thing without the need for an actual teacher threatening to send you to the Principle's office.   Your conception of what it means to be an adult is not purely determined by teachers and parents either - this is bigger than that. It's also your culture (or subculture): how as a man/woman you are \"supposed\" to behave, or what is cool/uncool, for example. I believe that kind of pressure is equally (or more) powerful, and it also serves to repress your natural childlike state. We could say that in addition to the little teacher you created in your mind, you create an equivalent figure for the group of peers you're trying to fit into, and it yells at you whenever you do something uncool.   Ground between these two rocks, authority and peer pressure, I believe that little is left of your inner child by age 20 or so. Its kind of still there, but it's been badly abused, shoved into the basement and chained to the wall. Many people have forgotten its even there. They're too busy trying to act out some script that was given to them, that really has nothing to do with who they truly are. Who doesn't want to be accepted? If anything, that's the only part of the inner child still left intact: this desperate desire to fit in. No one represses that desire, because it is so essential for being a zombie.   Yes, you have to learn how to be responsible and how to interact with your peers. You have to learn how to function in the adult world. But is functioning living? I'd argue that you can only truly live by being in touch with your authentic desires, by stubbornly insisting on your right to be a child - that is, to be a natural development of the person you were when you were a child. This is probably one of the most difficult things you can attempt - a zombified adult insists that everyone around him be a zombie as well, so most likely you will have to go around pretending you are a zombie too most of the time. The only way to make this bearable is if you find some non-zombie companions, around whom you are free to be your true, 100% self around.

In reality, those defense mechanisms have simply not yet developed in response to the real dangers that the world actually poses to the child.  >Why are children so joyful and carefree, while adults are often such miserable sacks of anxiety, depression, or some other form of psychosis?  because they don't know any better yet, and this is a very scary, hellish thing. This is why children get into vans with strangers and jump off roofs with superman capes on. we shold not desire to be more like children.  Instead, we shold desire to grow out of the naivete of childhood and into our various neuroses and psychoses, and then out of those and into a more flowing, harmonious unity with the dual nature of the world (dangerous/not dangerous).

I returned to the bar yesterday and talked to the bartender who said they had sent all the taken IDs to the state liquor board. After arguing with him I was able to talk to the owner of the bar. The owner asked for my name and after hearing it took my ID out of his pocket.

{"prompt": "Why does choosing the frequency band of WiFi (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz) affect the speed of WiFi, but for mobile frequencies (e.g. 3G and 4G) the carrier frequency doesn't affect the speed? From the articles I've read (and from personal experience), I understand that a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi signal provides internet to a larger area but sacrifices speed, while the 5GHz band provides faster speeds to a smaller area.  However, when I look at the frequency bands used in 3G mobile (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UMTS_frequency_bands) and 4G mobile (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_frequency_bands), the frequencies used in each technology don't seem all that different?  There are actually some frequencies used in 3G which are higher than 4G, yet 4G is so much faster than 3G. Why is this different from WiFi?", "preferred": "So a fair few incorrect/partially correct comments... On my phone so apologies for lack of number checking and grammar.  The underlying Shannon theory is data rate is determined by 2 things- bandwidth and modulation rate. The level of modulation is determined in turn by SNR.   10MHz of BW centered at 1GHz gives you the same potential data rate as 10MHz of BW centered on 100GHz (assuming signal strength is the same).   To directly answer your question, the 5GHz band has a lot more overall bandwidth than the allocated 2.4GHz band, and as noted above, also has less devices competing for the spectrum (so your device gets more dedicated chunks of time to communicate, and also the background noise/interference is lower).   I believe the individual channel sizes for WiFi at 5GHz are the same as at 2.4GHz. The speed increase is from less noise, more dedicated time, and importantly much more frequent 'channel bonding' to create mega channels, I think up to 160MHz. It's hard to do this at 2.4GHz as there are too many devices to give more than the minimum to one! (And I think the 2.4 band is only 80MHz wide in total?)  Howeverrrrr, having said all that the nature of radio does make it easier to engineer higher rates using higher carrier frequencies. This includes that often antennas have an effective frequency range which is a set % of the target carrier frequency. So, for the same antenna design capturing 10% of the spectrum around the carrier, higher freqs will be better.   This is why the superfast 5G speeds uses mmWave (e.g. 28GHz). There's a lot of available spectrum that you can engineer well to use  in a small handset. The well published downsides are the awful propagation characteristics at those high frequencies, so signal strength decays rapidly (hence why that spectrum has previously been unused - no-one wants it!)

When we transmit wireless signals we modulate them to travel in a different frequency band. Think of this like having a conversation in a noisy stadium vs in a quiet room. The stadium is the unmodulated signal and the quiet room is the modulated signal.  2.4 and 5 are the frequencies that we modulate to - more specifically these are just names for a set of frequencies that are available in this range, called channels. When you connect to the 2.4 band you might actually be at 2.3, 2.2, or 2.1 (these numbers were chosen arbitrarily).   When IEEE created the standard for wireless communications (802.11) they defined x number of channels to be available to available at the \"2.4 band.\" when 802.11 was updated (maybe 802.11ac??) to include the \"5 band\" they said that there will be y channels. The number of channels available at 5 are greater than the number of channels available at 2.4 (ie the number of quiet rooms is greater). 802.11ac also defines new techniques such as beam forming and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing... which are intended to improve performance.  One thing to know.. higher frequencies do not travel as far nor penetrate surfaces as deep as lower frequencies. Choosing which to use would probably be case by case."}

{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old: What's the point of entering your debit PIN when paying when you can just press credit and avoid entering it?", "preferred": "I see a lot of answers that look like they aren't addressing what the OP asked.  The question wasn't \"why would a store want you to pick debit instead of credit?\"  The question was why you have to enter a PIN for debit and not for credit?  If the card lets you use either mode and either mode draws from the same account, what's the point?  I viewed it as a question about security, not about transactional fees.  As to my attempt at an answer: The main reason is that they're two different systems developed independently from each other each with their own different laws and banks started issuing cards that let you access either system, but the old laws for each system are still present and need to be followed.  But that doesn't answer the question of what reasons there might be for different rules for them?   Basically, originally credit cards were never intended to be immediate transactions.  Before everything got computerized it was a promise to pay, not an immediate payment.  The restaurant, or store, bills the credit card company saying \"This is the total money you owe us on behalf of your customers that used your cards in our store today.\"  The credit card company pays that bill, and then you owe the credit card company for it at the end of the month.  This causes a large time buffer.  Because the payment doesn't happen immediately there is time to dispute the bill.  There is time to argue that fraud occurred.  The hope is that if someone uses the card illegally, there's time to find out before it wipes your bank account out.  The credit card company didn't suck the money right from you bank account - they waited for you to reimburse them.  Compare that with a debit card, which \\*did\\* directly suck money out of your bank account immediately.  No time to dispute the charge, it already happened.  That made it require more security.  There's no delay between a stolen card being used and you losing the money.  Even today, when both systems can be attached to the same account, so in credit mode it still sucks money out of your account just like in debit, there's still more legal channels available for fraud resolution in the credit system than the debit system.  Also, the debit system gives access to your money in untraceable cash form (withdraw from ATM then the cash becomes anonymous after that), while credit transactions all get a paper trail that can be traced.", "rejected": "Where are you that this is a thing?"}

Both my bachelor and master were in biomedicine, and I had not done any programming or machine learning courses before my PhD. Also, since over here you get a master before your PhD, there's not a lot of course work in the PhD. So I'd say I was definitely not as prepared as you are right now.      And to be honest, the first year was quite hard. Very steep learning curve. But you just have to stick with it. The good thing about bioinformatics is that by definition you need people from biology and people from informatics (and some other fields, ideally). So I got to teach the computer scientists in the department a lot of biology and in return they taught me a lot about machine learning and programming.

{"prompt": "Given that radiowaves reduce amplitude according to the inverse square law, how do we maintain contact with distant spacecraft like Voyager 1 & 2?", "preferred": "We get more of that signal than you think.  Rather than transmitting omnidirectional, that large parabolic antenna lets Voyager send a beam less than 1\u00b0 wide. The 70m dishes of the Deep Space Network (California, Spain, Australia) are also highly sophisticated and basically creates a receiver similar to a parabolic dish the diameter of the Earth, so we get about 10e-18W and not the 10e-27 you'd expect Voyager's 20W transmission to manage. It also uses the worldwide reserved frequency of 8.415GHz, but there's still resonant frequency noise as well as internal noise to contend with.  Those massive antennae are *also* ultra high-gain, so by accepting signals from only a *very* narrow band, they can isolate out a lot of the deep space background noise. The gain factor is somewhere around 8-10 million. Impressive.   The power's not going to last that much longer, but before it runs out, we're going to hit a different wall: signal-to-noise. In order to be able to distinguish data, the signal transmission rate has had to be slowed down a few times. This gets into information theory and things like bandwidth limits & response time, complicated by frequencies used. This is stuff Claude Shannon wrote the book on, and he & Harry Nyquist figured out these bandwidth limitations (Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem).  Back when it reached Jupiter (a measly billion miles away) the speed was 115K baud, impressive for terrestrial communications back when those bad boys launched. At Saturn we'd knocked that back by more than half to 44.8K.  A software upgrade drastically improved data compression so that pictures of Uranus & Neptune came back so much better, but the speeds were again reduced to 29.9K and 21.6K baud.  New Horizons transmitted those pics of Pluto at only 1200 baud, it was so far away. Voyager I is 5\u00d7 as far away as Pluto; it can only reliably transmit at 160 bits/sec. It can't transmit at any slower rate, so in just a few more years we won't be able to pick out the data from the noise. There'll still be a few years left when we can track it through the carrier wave, but then...  It'll be another few more years until their plutonium is spent, and then...  It was great knowin' ya.", "rejected": "Keep an eye on https://eyes.nasa.gov/dsn/dsn.html to see what spacecraft are actively talking on the Deep Space Network.

It\u2019s a combination of employers   A) hiring people or using managers with no experience recruiting. Everyone thinks it\u2019s so easy, but most recruiters don\u2019t make the cut. Many of the inexperienced recruiters can\u2019t handle the candidate reaction to a rejection so they just don\u2019t do it. Hiring managers think they are too good for admin work (and hey they are probably really busy) so once they hire someone they immediately change their focus to the next hire/fire/etc.   B) refusing to pay a little bit more money for intuitive software that at the very least automatically says \u201chey we got your info, don\u2019t call us well call you if interested.\u201d Otherwise someone actually has to go in and click things to make that happen.  C) expecting too much from recruiters. I\u2019ve worked weekends just to send mass templates rejection letters because I have too much other stuff to do during work time.

{"prompt": "What are some good or unusual tweaks you use on rather common recipes? Today I found out about Orange mashed potatoes which is basically just adding an orange juice reduction (and if you like some sour cream) to your normal recipe and garnishing it with some orange zest. I like it because it's something i wouldn't have thought about. Do you know of similar tweaks to things you prepare sometimes?!", "preferred": "*  Coating chicken breasts with powdered milk (in addition to whatever herbs+spices) helps it brown quicker so that the outside is nice and brown without drying out the meat.  *  I use a baking soda mix to rough up the surface of really smooth meats so that they brown much better.  Chicken breast, loins, and other whole muscle meats take this well.  *  Using homemade shio koji in place of salt in many savory dishes adds a little savory bump to dishes.  *  When apple juice concentrate goes on sale, I buy 3-4 cans.  1 can apple juice concentrate + 2TB kosher salt = super tasty dark meat poultry brine.  Bonus if you sear then smoke the birds.  Citrus juices work too but the high acidity tends to make the meat mushy.  *  When recipes ask for the use of any citrus, I use at least 2 versions of that citrus to increase the complexity of the profile.  If lemon chicken requires lemon juice, then I use lemon juice, fresh zest, and macerated lemon peel.  *  When recipes ask for vinegar, I sometimes mix and use multiple types to make the profile interesting.  For example, a balsamic vinegar dressing might also include a partial substitution with rice vinegar or black vinegar.  *  Nearly every root vegetable can be made in the same style as mashed potato.  My favorite is half celery root and half yukon gold potatoes.  It's lighter and there's a slight herbal hint that goes well with the cream and butter.  Parsnip and potato is a nice combo too.  *  When coating small items with salt.... nuts, popcorn, croutons, etc.... I use Flavacol.  Read the reviews here.  *  When making poke, I always start by coating the fish with sesame oil first.  If you salt and spice it first then the fish gets mushy quicker and weeps fish juice.  Blech.  *  When making grilled cheese, I start by putting one piece of bread down in the hot pan ON TOP of cheese.  In 3-4 minutes, the cheese browns and gets really nutty.  Then I flip that slice, add more cheese, and another buttered slice on top.  The nutty cheese inside of the sandwich is life changing if you use a flavorful cheese and brown it right.  *  When making kale salads, chop the kale and then roll it tightly in a kitchen towel.  Then twist, massage, and bend the bundle to tenderize the kale.  It removes some of the unpleasant toughness.  *  When serving foods that are accompanied by mustard and ketchup, I make 'fresh' versions which can be a refreshing change from the bottled stuff.  Ketchup is basically a cooked combination of tomato sauce, vinegar, sugar, onion powder, and salt.  I just mix those ingredients and add a tomato (shaved over a grater).  The fresh versions are definitely different in flavor but just similar enough to make a friendly impression.  I do the same with mustard starting with mustard powder, vinegar,  soy sauce, pepper, salt, and spices.  *  When I serve steaks, I buy +15% more than I need and dry age at home. http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/dry-aged-chimney-porterhouse-recipe.html  I have more but I have to actually work today.", "rejected": "Chocolate loves salt.

{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old: What makes cleaning/sanitizing alcohol different from drinking alcohol? When distilleries switch from making vodka to making sanitizer, what are doing differently?", "preferred": "**Edit:** Since people are (potential) idiots. **You can make hand sanitizer from Everclear/Pure Ehtanol, but reverse is not true!!!** Hand sanitizer will often have toxic additives in it. Answer was also made in context of a question, when destileries switched from drinking alcohol to hand sanitizer, all they did was change proportions and added some stuff. They did not suddenly change to producing isopropyl alcohol.  ---  **Explain like I'm five years old**: Most hand sanitizers use Ethanol - same alcohol that's present in vodka, wine and beer, they do use special mix of 60-80% of ethanol in a solution, with extra additives that make it better for your hands. They also make it taste _very_ bad so you don't drink it, so don't.  ---  No longer short or Explain like I'm five years old really:   The main ingredient in majority of consumer grade hand sanitizer is Ethanol. This is the same alcohol as one used in most alcoholic drinks. Hand Sanitizers can be made form other alcohols (eg. isopropyl), but the ones that come from distilleries will be with Ethanol.  So let's break it down:  Pure Ethanol/Everclear/Spiritus: 95% (+-) of Ethanol (this is maximum you can get in normal conditions).  Vodka: 40% of Ethanol in the solution.  Hand Sanitizer: 60-80% Ethanol in the solution + additives.  Main difference is percentage percentage of Ethanol and Water in the mix, and use of additives in hand sanitizer.  The easiest way to make a hand sanitizer is to simply mix pure Ethanol with Vodka in 1-1 proportions (you get 69% strength, right int the middle of a bacteria/virus killing range, and a silly percentage).  Except you'll find it is about 2-3 times as expensive as the same quantity of a store bought hand sanitizer. What gives? Taxes. Alcohol after gasoline is one of the most taxed substances. But hand sanitizer is usually exempt.  But then what would stop people from just drinking hand sanitizer for a cheaper thrill?  Additives. Those additives make the hand sanitizer both more friendly to the skin, and also make the alcohol hard to drink without purifying. Let me repeat: **Additives in hand sanitizer make it unsuitable - and in some cases even harmful - to drink!!!**  PS. Since people asked.  *All natural, organic, hand made sanitizing wipes* recipe by yours truly. Based on WHO recommendations for developing nations. Tested and tried in March, and in continuous use since then, since I don't trust cheap generic ones that don't list all ingridients with percentages and I've found a wipe form to be super-handy:  1. Mix 500ml of Pure Ethanol/Everclear/Spirytus(95%) and 500ml of Vodka(40%), or mix 500ml of Pure Ethanol(95%) with 250ml of Water.    1. Optional (for extra effectiveness): Add a full tablespoon of a food grade citric acid per liter.    2. Optional (if you don't want to use separate hand moisturizer): Add 10ml of Glycerine or \\~100ml Aloe oil.    3. Optional (if you want it to have gelatinous consistency, I usually don't as it makes hand sticky): Add appropriate amount of gelling agent (eg. Agar Agar, Gelatine). 2. Pour into a sealable container. 3. Soak a roll of cotton wipes (\\~1$ a roll) in the mixture (I unroll them for this). 4. After they soak in, transfer some of the wipes into sealed child wipes container. 5. Carry the container with you :) If you didn't do 1.2 option, few minutes after wiping with alcohol, use hand moisturizer (my preference is shea butter).  I've found that in good baby-wipe container they stay moist for \\~2 weeks. When sealed in tupperware or similar they last for months. As a bonus you can also sanitize cotton masks in this mixture (leave for few hours, wring out, then leave in sun to dry)", "rejected": "There is no difference between the ethanol in hand sanitizer and the ethanol in vodka. Except that hand sanitizer is mostly pure ethanol, and it has some added chemicals to make it thicker and poisonous to drink.

So the short answer is: they run a program that, if you give it a number, it spits out a different, unpredictable number. When that output number matches a third number closely enough, you win. Think of it as guessing lottery numbers.", "rejected": "There is a special function called a cryptographic hash. Basically it takes anything as input and produces a fixed-length output. For all intents and purposes here, you can basically treat the output as being random. Meaning you can't predict what the output is going to be for any given input without simply trying.  For miners, the input is the block they want to add to the block chain, plus a magic number they get to come up with. They then combine the two and perform the cryptographic hash. What they're looking for is for a output of the hash that has certain properties. For example, the hash (being a number) has 32 trailing zeros.  Since the output isn't predictable it's basically simply a matter of choosing random magic numbers (as part of the input), combining it with the block, hashing it, and seeing what you get out of it. It's brute force and odds go to whoever is faster (can make more guesses in a certain amount of time).  Whoever produces the correct hash output first gets to add their block to the block chain. This block will have a special transaction that creates new cryptocurrency out of thin air and adds it to their wallet. Basically they get paid. Additionally, the block main contain special transactions from other users that give money to whoever adds that block to the block chain."}

Dough should be at room temperature before attempting to form.", "rejected": "I would make it a week or two ahead and freeze it.  You can thaw it in a cooler for a couple of days and have it essentially ready to go from the cooler without ever tying up fridge space that way.  You will need to rotate your frozen balls of dough in the cooler.  If I were doing 20-ish or more balls, I would start 48 hours out in a cooler that was half filled with the balls.    That said - and having some experience with make your own pizza parties - you may want to take a little different approach: make and par bake your crusts a couple of days out rather than having each pie tie up the oven space too long.  I have found that folks frequently overload their pizza party pizzas, so that they take for bloody ever to cook.  When the crust is par baked,the whole process of melting the 2 pounds of cheese and heating the 70-11 ingredients they chose goes more quickly."}

{"prompt": "(Washington) I just found out my husband has taken a second mortgage on our house, emptied our bank account, our savings and has $25,000 of debt on our credit card - all spent on the stock market When I say that I had no idea I'm being honest. I was blindsided by this. Over the past almost two years, my husband of seven years emptied our savings account, put over $25,000 of debt on our credit card, taken a second mortgage on half of the house, is in default for both mortgages, our car and our other bills and has drained our joint bank account as well. He's even sold anything of value that we had, like his watch, my jewelry or one of our laptops.  He showed me statements for payments and our accounts. I didn't know they were not real. He has a degree in finance and one in business so while I thought I was involved I let him take care of it. I didn't know he wasn't being truthful. He said he started buying and selling stocks for fun and it got out of control but he's going to fix it. He posts on different online places about his 'hobby' with other stock traders.  I went to stay with a friend. Besides some clothes and my ID I didn't even have much to take. The place I worked is out of business because of Covid so I lost my job two weeks ago. To top it all off I'm about a month pregnant with our first child. I have no money because he spent it all. He told me my engagement ring was being cleaned but he sold it and our wedding rings.  I want to divorce him but I have no money for a lawyer. I don't know where to start.. I've never needed one before this. Can I get a lawyer to work up front while I look for a job? We've been married for seven years. What will happen with the divorce and dividing things up if he spent it all?

{"prompt": "CMV: Political Correctness was never much of an issue, and today the word \"Political Correctness\" is mostly used wrongly to disguise racism, sexism, homophobia, or to attack progressive social views with no real arguments. In short, my point is this :  1) There are multiple possible definitions of P.C.  2) One of these definitions refers to a behavior which is a bit ridicule, therefore easy to mock. (I will call it \"silly PC\")  3) A lot of people have spent a lot of time attacking, criticizing and mocking this form of PC, therefore giving the word \"PC\" a bad image.  4) The word is also used to refer to some progressive social ideas (We will call this \"progressive PC\")  5) The bad image of Silly PC is used as an argument against progressive PC, despite the fact that they are not the same thing.  Now, some details and explanations.   2) Political Correctness originally refers to the idea of changing your language and actions in order to be very careful not to offend anyone. This behavior (which we will call \"silly PC\") can be observed on some places of the Internet (like tumblr), and in some public figures (politicians, companies, etc..) who don't want bad press. Another facet of this behavior is people who get offended at almost anything, and attack anything that offends them as racist/sexist/homophobic. These are the infamous Social Justice Warriors. This behavior is a bit laughable, but it's not a big deal. Sometimes there's a good reason for silly PC (companies can really suffer from a community getting offended), but even when it's unjustified it doesn't do much harm. Contrarily to what is said, PC has never been oppressing or restricting of liberties. There isn't, that I know of, any law or regulation which prohibits offending people. The worst that can happen to someone for not respecting silly PC is getting yelled at by some twats on the Internet. However :  3) Despite not being such a big deal, silly PC has been massively attacked by the Internet. There are countless videos and memes mocking silly PC, highlighting every way in which it's stupid, and calling it an attack on freedom. Basically, silly PC has a very bad press. It's seen as a form of oppression from the system, and political incorrectness is seen as edgy rebellion (despite being very mainstream).  4) Everything I've said until now wouldn't be much of a problem if it weren't for this next point : PC has another meaning. It refers to a wide, vaguely defined range of social progressive ideas, which mostly fall along the lines of defending gender equality, racial equality, and acceptance of the LGBT community. This second definition will be called \"progressive PC\". I want to emphasize that silly PC and progressive PC are two different things. It's possible to defend gender equality with some very controversial statements that will offend a lot of people. It's also possible to follow silly PC while defending some conservative anti-gay policies. When a Christian right politician says that he defends \"freedom of religion\" when he's in fact trying to defend Christianity and oppress atheism, that person is thinking one thing but saying another in fear of upsetting someone. Silly PC is not the same as progressive PC. It so happens that, at the time the word \"Political Correctness\" became popular, a lot of examples of silly PC were from people who defended progressive social ideas, so the association was made.  5) Unfortunately, most people don't seem to realize that silly PC and progressive PC are two different things. They use the words \"PC\" to mean alternatively one or the other, without any distinction. This is bad, because it results in one of the worst equivocation fallacies of modern times. Progressive PC is called \"PC\", and PC has a very bad image because of silly PC. People will justify why they don't like PC with silly PC, then use the fact that they don't like PC to attack progressive PC. In the process, no valid argument has been made against progressive PC, yet it's lost a lot of credibility. I have seen many instances of people using PC to justify racism, sexism or homophobia. What I see most however is people reacting to changes and policies which don't do any harm and slightly improve the world by calling it \"PC\" and disproving with no further justification.  In the end, the very existence of the term \"Political Correctness\" is a nuisance to mankind. It reacts to an issue which never was a real issue, and it's used as a shield and banner for sexism, racism and homophobia. _____  > *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

These words still seemed packed with value judgements. Are there any newer paradigms that are cropping up or are these still accepted?", "preferred": "I have worked in the \"development\" sector for thirty years, and these terms are understood to be value laden, western centric and problematic. There has been a bit of a movement, particularly over the last decade or so, to describe countries in income related terms - lower income, middle income etc.   The problem is that these labels are also criticised for being problematic too, ie they reduce \"development\" to being simply about income, when in fact there are a huge and dizzying range of factors that are important, not just income.  A colleague of mine once looked into this during her academe years. The conclusion of her work was that ALL simple and catchy descriptive summary words or phrases were problematic in some way, mostly because they all encode some kind of normative value judgements and privilege certain values and judgements over others. They HAVE TO, in fact, in order to be short and snappy enough to be... well, short and snappy.  I came to the conclusion that there was no way round it. Apart from acknowledging the value judgements thus encoded, doing one's best to both explain how one is remaining aware of those biases and also attempting to level them to the extent possible for humans, one cannot use simple descriptive phrases that are not problematic in some way. So acknowledge, aim for transparency, aim for as much non-bias and objectivity as possible, and don't get hung up on it.  Transparency is worth it. Genuine and honest effort to be non-biased is worth it. Aiming for objectivity (or at least intellectual honesty) is worth it. Reflexivity is worth it.

We went out for a small walk, then we started toweling him off a little as he was so wet. He tries to bite the towel, so far so normal. Anyways, out of nowhere, he started screaming a banshee, and ran away from us, he looked blind with pain, he ran so fast he fell down the two garden steps and sat on the yawn crouched and screaming. We were in complete shock, thought that maybe my OH had stepped on him or something. It took a while to calm him but he seemed ok for a few hours, did a lot of sleeping. He was wagging his tail though and took some treats. About 6 hours later he was sitting on his sofa playing with a toy and I was rubbing him gently, anyways same again sudden screech and he ran from the room tail between his legs back to his crate. It\u2019s like a blind panic, he\u2019d run into a wall, it\u2019s real fight or flight.   Today we were super cautious only a tiny walk. He\u2019s eating his meals as normal. He was unusually cuddly today but otherwise seemed back to himself. Just two minutes ago though again same thing except this time no one was touching him, he had a toy again.

We did some googling and mostly it talks about vaccines (he had his second shot since we\u2019ve had him on Thursday, not sure exactly which) and sore spots but this recent time no one was touching him. As he had a toy my OH thinks maybe there\u2019s a problem with his teeth or he\u2019s biting his tongue or something but I find that hard to believe because then I think he wouldn\u2019t be eating meals and playing as normal. The toys squeak but that normally doesn\u2019t bother him so it\u2019s not a fright from that. I actually feel physically sick with worry.

{"prompt": "CMV: Most people hate cats for irrational and trendy reasons. I'm a cat person so you know where my bias is heading. Often times I here people say they hate cats but I've never heard really any good reason to hate cats. The only one I can really understand is that they're allergic. But other than that, cats are pretty easy to maintain and take care of especially compared to dogs. Whenever someone says they hate cats they always use vague terms like, \"cats are evil\", or \"cats are just mean\". I think what people don't understand is that cats don't love unconditionally like dogs do. From my experience if you treat a cat with love and take care of it as you should cats can be the most love able creatures on the planet. With dogs however, you could literally be abusive to a dog as long as you feed it it'll still obey your command.  That's why I think majority of people say they hate cats. Because cats aren't going to blindly follow all your commands like a dog would so therefore they aren't as programmable as dogs if that makes sense. Each cat has its own unique personality and what it likes.  Cats also don't attack people like dogs do cats for the most part just mind their own business and don't require much attention. Cats are much more hygienic than dogs, cats don't bark all the time and disturb people, cats overall don't really bother anyone. So why do so many people claim they \"hate\" cats when cats have never done anything bad to them?

{"prompt": "CMV: Believing that people should not be clinically obese is not fatphobic. Fatphobia is a real thing, but it is often misused and has gained traction as a term to end arguments against obesity without having to hear the other persons point. Fatphobia is discrimination and hatred towards fat people, the way homophobia is towards gay people. While believing that people shouldn't be gay is homophobic, believing someone should lose some weight or that being excessively overweight is unhealthy for them isn't the same. I understand there are still some people who believe that being gay is a choice or something the individual can change, but in my experience and understanding, who you like is who you like. Contrary to that, your bodyfat percentage is a result of your diet intake against your activity level. In this the two are very different, as judging someone over something that they cannot change is not fair, and telling someone without judging them the benefits of a change that they could make is not wrong.  Harassment and mistreatment of someone who is obese, because they are obese is fatphobic, and unwanted diet or exercise advice is actually a well meaning form of harassment, but still harassment. That being clarified, someone posting on a diet or exercise post, that is intended for people who actively want change, is not fatphobic propaganda. Additionally when someone brings up the health benefits of weight loss or diet and exercise, it is more commonly than not, not being used as an attack. Furthermore, it is medically backed fact. I want to being this back to the sexuality parallel from earlier. Sexuality being a choice is only an opinion, and the drawbacks of obesity and the benefits of weight loss are facts. They aren't forcing an opinion on someone but rather using truth to back their side of a discussion.   As I have repeatedly stated, the line comes down to having a belief vs forcing your belief on others. Inherently having the belief that being obese is bad, is in itself ok. Forcing that belief on others and shaming them for being obese, and calling them names is fatphobic, which is wrong. It's like religion. Its fine to have one, but don't start preaching unless you have a clear indication the other person wants to hear it. Speaking about the benefits and drawbacks of a status vs going into a situation is isn't suited and trying to force its relevance is a major issue.   Circiling back to preferences, someone who isn't attracted to someone who is fat is the same as someone who isn't attracted to someone who is skinny. It isn't phobic, it is a preference. I personally enjoy most sizes of women, but for men prefer more fit individuals. That is just what I like, and what I don't like isn't a form of hate, but more a lack of interest. I am 6ft tall, which is well above average height. When I get told that by someone that they like taller guys, I don't assume they are being phobic, they have a preference for really tall individuals, and I don't hold it against them. Even if I am disappointed, it is no excuse to stoop to accusing someone of discriminatory bigotry.", "preferred": "Your idea of fatphobia is very reductive; you frame it as if the only thing that really counts as fatphobia is outright harassment and name calling. Fatphobia however, can be insidious. It's often framed as 'concern' or common sense advice. A fat person goes to the doctor and says, 'I've got a new pain here in this part of my body'. The doctor says 'just lose weight' and won't do any tests. This doctor is so obsessed with fat that he overlooks other possibilities. Turns out to be cancer, and the patient has a worse outcome because it is discovered later due to the doctor's fatphobia.", "rejected": "The fundamental issue with trying to draw a line in the sand is that jerks who hate fat people will also claim that they're just giving friendly advice because they too don't want people to be fat.  The fact is, people's health should be an issue between them and their doctor (and anyone else they choose to involve). It's just that since weight is so obvious everyone else feels like they're justified in mentioning it."}
{"prompt": "Eli5: why haven\u2019t we started considering or implementing large scale desalinization in response to our water shortages?", "preferred": "So I'm going to talk about this from the perspective of the western United States. Obviously things will be different depending on where you live.   There isn't really a \"shortage\" of water in the United states. I mean there *technically is*, we don't have as much water as we want to use, but that \"shortage\" has far more to do with what we use the water for than lack of rain or snow.   Industrial, home use and commercial water use make up only 14% of all water use in the United States. There's plenty of water in the state that even if those users quadrupled their demand (they never would), we would have no problem meeting that need. The category that is actually using all of our water (86%) is agriculture. Now agriculture is really important and I'm not saying we should stop growing food but many of these farmers are receiving huge allotments of water at ridiculously cheap prices (tens or hundreds of gallons per penny, orders of magnitude cheaper than water to salination could ever provide). For varying reasons too, they are not being incentivized to be very efficient with their water use either. In fact, because many of their water allowments are written weirdly into state laws, they actually need to use an excess amount of water or they lose it. Even the ones who aren't incentivized in that way are getting water so cheap that they're frequently just using it to dump in the desert to grow incredibly water inefficient crops like alfalfa for cattle feed.  Tldr: the Western United States has plenty of water to meet its needs. If we could figure out how to stop vastly overusing it.", "rejected": "Money plain and simple. Desalination of seaworthy is prohibitively expensive. After desalination, the water would have to sell for about 10 to 15 dollars per 1000 gallons. Nobody I'd gonna pay that to irrigate a crop or water their lawn or flush their toilet."}
{"prompt": "Byzantine and Renaissance scholars wrote commentaries on Plato and Aristotle. Are those commentaries considered relevant today, or has scholarship moved on enough that the commentaries would seem very dated or totally irrelevant?", "preferred": "One of the things that often happens in scholarship is that scholars settle for a time -- sometimes a *long* time! -- on certain orientations and assumptions about what to read and how to interpret it, and so on. And then someone comes along and shakes things up by showing how some of these assumptions are limiting or indeed just wrong.  The commentary tradition on Plato and Aristotle is useful here, since in giving us windows into how Plato and Aristotle were approached in different places and times, they can help us become more conscious of the assumptions we're making in our own approaches to Plato and Aristotle. Not too uncommonly, they can even show us how some of our assumptions may have been quite wrong -- how we'd become *trapped*, so to speak, in a tradition of scholarship that was imposing these assumptions on us.  For instance, in the medieval period the approach to Plato and Aristotle tended to be significantly determined by the particular context of Christian Platonism and the subsequent commitments of the medieval tradition of commentary that then developed in this context. This way of approaching Plato and Aristotle has also often been quite influential on modern interpretations of them, due both to the pervasive influence of the medieval commentators and things like the ongoing defense of Aristotelian-Thomistic philosophy by Catholic intellectuals. But this interpretive framework tends to bring with it assumptions that are, let's say, *questionable*.  And the commentary tradition has been useful in bringing this to our attention and giving us resources to correct it. For instance, Aquinas' interpretation of Aristotle's psychology has been and continues to be extremely influential, such that we often think of Aristotle's psychology just as being the way Aquinas explained it -- even if it never occurs to us that Aquinas has anything to do with it. Aristotelian commentaries like those of Alexander of Aphrodisias -- this was in the 3rd century, mind you -- have provided helpful insight leading us to separate Aristotle from Aquinas' interpretation of him and revisit the relevant questions about his psychology anew. If you want an example from the Renaissance, the same kind of point applies: a lot of the reassessment of classical sources in the Renaissance was explicitly motivated as an attempt to reassess them independently of the context inherited from medieval scholasticism. So a Renaissance commentary on Aristotle -- like, for instance, that of Zabarella -- is interesting for how it gives us a different take on Aristotle.  As for how helpful such things are, it probably depends on the topic and your interest. Certainly, the commentary tradition is emphatically *not* \"very dated or totally irrelevant.\" If you were writing, say, a doctoral thesis on Aristotle's psychology or Aristotle's logic, it would be perfectly sensible and instructive to read, say, Alexander of Aphrodisias or Zabarella, respectively.  A lot of the help we've found from such sources has, as /u/Kusiemsk says, been \"incorporated into modern commentaries.\" But I suppose I would give the point a slightly different emphasis insofar as (i) I still think there's plenty of interesting work to be done on the commentary tradition -- actually I think that's pretty uncontentious! -- and in ways that will inform our readings of Plato and Aristotle. And (ii) I'm much less optimistic in my timeline than they are: I'd push against the idea that such lessons as are available from the commentary tradition are \"typically already incorporated into post-18th century classical commentaries\", as I think a lot of really instructive lessons have been drawn fairly recently and there's, again fairly recently, if anything been a kind of burgeoning of new research in this area.", "rejected": "It seems that by \"relevant\"  you mean \"helpful for determining Plato's original meaning.\" In that sense, general consensus is that they are not more helpful than modern commentaries by classicists. Even when the Byzantine and Renaissance commentaries get things right (which they do), those insights are often incorporated into modern commentaries such that you can avoid going to the source.  However, many medieval and Renaissance commentators explicitly state that they are not merely looking to historically reconstruct Plato's views but rather to extend and apply them, so this is a bit of a gap between what we prioritize now and what they did. This raises the applicability of other forms of relevance: relevant for understanding Byzantine and Renaissance thought in themselves, relevant for broader reconstructions of the reception of Plato, and perhaps most interestingly for this sub, relevant for the philosophical arguments they make abstracted of their particular historical exegesis. I would argue that the commentaries are well worth studying for these ends and that they are often deeply under-studied for this last point.  All of this is to say it depends on how you define relevant and what your intention of reading Plato or the commentaries is, but they certainly have their place even if they're not historically reliabile for understanding Plato in a 4th-5th century BC Athenian context."}

{"prompt": "Can I take my neighbours cat to the vet? A few weeks ago a random cat showed up in my backyard. She was extremely shy and apprehensive at first. We let her come and go whenever she likes, but over the past week she's been sleeping on our front porch or by the balcony door, so we'd let her sleep in our house overnight.  After a few days I noticed that she had begun to lose weight so I ended up feeding her (grain free, hypoallergenic, wet cat food). Turns out the owners left for the week and just left the cat outside without food and water and in the awful air quality.  She's highly asthmatic, with strong asthma attacks twice a day and 2-3 times at night (I hepa filter my entire home and have no irritants). She doesn't have a collar but is microchipped. I got in touch with her owners but they don't care about getting her any medical care.   In fact, the owner got mad at me for feeding her (?) and told me to not let the cat into my house (kick the cat out if it walked in). Meanwhile, the cat was having a serious asthma attack right in front of her and and the owner didn't even flinch. When they were leaving my home, she had to grab the cat and pick it up because it wouldn't follow them.   I'm at a crossroad. The cat keeps coming back to my house and is 'claiming' it as her place, mostly just napping here. I leave my door open and even lead the cat outside but she keeps walking in and planting herself here. I want to help the cat, would I be able to bring her to a vet even if i'm not her owner?", "preferred": "This situation happened to us and it was really awkward. Slowly, over time, we ended up feeding the cat and setting up a cold weather shelter for it. Also took it to the vet several times on our dime. Eventually found out who the owner was and met her.    The cat stayed outside until he became ill.  Then he wanted to come on (winter) and we let him despite our house cats objection. The owner did not respond to any attempt to reach her so we took him to her vet where we learned he had cancer. We were with him in the end. I\u2019ll always remember the kindness of his vet and ours and will never think of his owner as a decent human being.   So wishing you well in this situation.

This is for good reason: usability evaluation has a significant role to play when conditions warrant it. Yet evaluation can be ineffective and even harmful if naively done 'by rule' rather than 'by thought'. If done during early stage design, it can mute creative ideas that do not conform to current interface norms. If done to test radical innovations, the many interface issues that would likely arise from an immature technology can quash what could have been an inspired vision. If done to validate an academic prototype, it may incorrectly suggest a design's scientific worthiness rather than offer a meaningful critique of how it would be adopted and used in everyday practice. If done without regard to how cultures adopt technology over time, then today's reluctant reactions by users will forestall tomorrow's eager acceptance. The choice of evaluation methodology - if any - must arise from and be appropriate for the actual problem or research question under consideration."}

{"prompt": "Graduating and very worried Hey, I'll keep it short. I study aerospace engineering at a top 10 school. I'm graduating in 3 weeks and I've realized just how much I've fucked up. My GPA's about a 2.9, I don't have nearly as much involvement in design teams as I would've liked, and I have 1 internship that - while it was a great and legitimately rewarding experience - was an REU, and I'm not sure how jobs view those. I was super involved in a club that didn't directly deal with my degree (don't wanna get into specifics, basically public speaking experience), and while I enjoyed doing it, it's starting to dawn on me how much time I wasted doing that.  I'm applying for jobs, reaching out to recruiters, going to virtual career fairs and so far, nothing. And even if I get an offer, I'm super worried that I'm just inflating my experience, and that when I start work they'll realize I'm a fool. I'd call this impostor syndrome, except this might just be reality.  Just tell me: am I fucked, and how bad is it?  Also, any advice is really appreciated.", "preferred": "I graduated in Spring 19 in Aerospace Engineering, was kinda in the same boat as you and this is what I did  1. Joined as many job sites as possible, linkedin, indeed, glassdoor and zip recruiter.  If you count \"easy apply\", I probably sent 300+ applications     2. If I really cared about the job, I took out time to write a cover letter. This is the format I used   \"I'm writing this letter to express interest in position XYX in Company ABC  I offer x years of experience in (SolidWorks), y years of experience in (heat transfer) and I have a degree in Aerospace engineering from (Uni)   I look forward to speaking with you about how I can use my skills to add value to your company  Sincerely   Throwawayh3lpplz\"   3. I applied for Mechanical engineering jobs because Aero/Mech is very closely related.   4. Through my search I learned about the various types of companies in the aerospace industry: flying cars/VTOL (kitty Hawk and Joby Aviation), CubeSat/satellite operations, airplanes, rockets, drones, NavAir (the navy needs A.E to repair their fleet), and other defense companies that build missiles. Cast your net as wide as you can.    5. This is the most important point: take on a part time job while you're searching for your engineering role. Not only are you earning spending money, but if an interviewer asks you what have you been doing since graduating, you can let him know you're contributing in some way and not sitting on your couch at home.  I worked at a tutoring center and then as a community college tutor, and tbh that was great because of two reasons, 1. I got to work on my communication skills and 2. it kept my math/Engr knowledge fresh in my head.    6. In your interview, always ask questions about the company, like their work style, culture etc. These are two must ask questions  (i) A year from now, what do you expect the candidate to have accomplished to be considered successful?  (ii) Based on our conversation, is there any hesitancy in hiring me for the position? (Based on their answer, you get to know if you are strong contender or not. If they point out flaws, sell yourself some more, like 'I'm a fast learner!')    7. Take a deep breath and calm down. Understand that finding an engineering job is going to take months, not weeks. It's a marathon, not a sprint. Don't forget to look at your resume and tweak it every few weeks. The resume I used at the beginning of my job search was a 4/10 compared to the resume I used when I landed my job months later.    8. You may not have the money or motivation to do your Masters like me, so consider getting some licenses in Aerospace related fields.  Like, the HAM radio license to transmit on radio waves, used in satellite operations. The test is less than $20 dollars, requires around a week of studying.  (go to QRZ. com for a study guide)  And the Remote Pilot License, FAA 107, this one lets you use drones and other unmanned aircraft systems for commercial purposes, and will teach you a lot about airspace and FAA guidelines. This test is ~&150.  It's something to consider. Plus it's something to add to your resume.    Hope all this info helps. Don't give up!", "rejected": "It may cost you more money, but an MS in mechanical engineering may be of interest to you as a backup plan.

{"prompt": "is psychology \"distinct from neurology\" becoming obsolete as an academic discipline? Hi everyone,   I am reading *Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature* and came across the following remark in a footnote: \"The disappearance of psychology as a discipline distinct from neurology, and similar cultural developments, might eventually free us from the image of the Mirror of Nature much more effectively than philosophers' identity theories.\"   The book came out in 1979. I got curious about what has become of psychology as an academic discipline in US universities. I guess it is undergoing changes, faster and ever faster? Under the pressure of advances (developments) in neuro-sciences?   Has psychology as an academic discipline become more a \"science\" than a humanities (or humanistic social science) discipline? everywhere?  What we call \"moral psychology\" -- is it  something that will not be taught, not be mentioned, in Psychology departments?", "preferred": "I'm a philosopher who is a member of a psych lab at my institution.  Psychology is alive and well as a distinctive discipline. Like other sciences, it continues to broaden, deepen, and fragment. It's possible that it will one day become something different, or multiple distinct things, but there is absolutely no chance that it will be subsumed by neuroscience. It may become more integrated with neuroscience, but it will never be fully replaced by it.   Let me say a little bit about why that's the case with the example of cognitive psychology. It turns out that what neuroscientists study -- the wetware of the brain -- is, for the purposes of studying cognition, in many respects irrelevant. It's not always irrelevant, and sometimes it's extremely important exactly *how* the mind is implemented. But usually in cognitive science, the wetware implementation is irrelevant. What cognizers do is solve problems, and at an abstract level, it doesn't matter if we solve those problems with neurons, transistors, or something else. So, the study of cognition is fairly independent from neuroscience, and there is little about the methodology or theories of neuroscience that can subsume the discipline of psychology.   A natural thought is that, in the same way that physics subsumes chemistry because it's more fundamental, the same could be said of the relationship between neuroscience and psychology. But what's interesting is that in an important sense, we have the neurons we have *because* of the structure of cognition. So for certain theoretical purposes, the explanatory order is reversed, much like with the way that population biology explains facts about the colors of birds feathers.", "rejected": "Psychology is definitely a thoroughly scientific nowadays, insofar as it uses similar methodological practices as the standard sciences. Has it collapsed into neuroscience though? I'd say not. Neuroscience is very related to psychology, and has important implications for pretty much every subdiscipline in psychology, but it has not totally subsumed the field. Areas like social psychology, evolutionary psychology, and abnormal psychology are certainly *informed* by neuroscience but they still operate on their own and at a more macro-level. Of course, that doesn't mean that they aren't sciences: they still operate much more like other sciences than like the humanities. Psychological research has a lot of crossover to areas like philosophy, of course. I myself think that neuroscience will continue to seep in and eventually dominate even more of psychology, but that's a prediction and not the current state of affairs."}
{"prompt": "Engineers that get their hands dirty? Hello! Sorry for the wall of text coming up, I'm on mobile. Anyway, I'm curious about engineering fields where there is opportunity to be more hands on in mechanical aspects. I graduated in 2014 with a BS in physics, and minors in math and chemistry. Along the way I learned some basic CAD on ProE and it was enough (Also with the help of a connection) to land my first Mechanical Designing job which I worked until last March. The job also taught me SolidWorks and AutoCAD.   Since leaving that job (long story why), I've been doing a lot of construction jobs and working in bars to make ends meet. I love getting dirty and being tired from exhaustion at the end of they day, but I want to use my mind more. I plan to go back to Grad school to get a masters in engineering, but I'm having a really hard time picking a direction that would be best for me. I worked both ends of the spectrum of manual labor and sitting at a desk for 10 hours. So my question is, which fields in engineering allow for the most of hands on work while still doing designing and working with the PLM cycle?    I was thinking robotics, but at my age (24) and knowing next to nothing about the subject, I feel like it's a little too late.

{"prompt": "CMV: Halle Bailey should not have been cast as Ariel in the live-action remake of The Little Mermaid I know this is a topic that has been debated a lot since 2019. Now the movie has wrapped filming, I still have so many doubts about this casting just because I just love and care about this story so much\u2026  First of all, I\u2019m a huge Disney fan and I even worked in Disney's internal consulting team before. I\u2019m not arguing this to bring shame on Disney. I\u2019m arguing this because I sincerely wish the success of every Disney film. Secondly, I personally don\u2019t have any negative opinions about Halle Bailey. She\u2019s an excellent singer. I love the way how she interpreted\u00a0Can You Feel the Love Tonight\u00a0on Disney World 50. She definitely has the voice to become Ariel, but  Here are the reasons why I think Halle Bailey should not have been cast as Ariel:  * Culturally: The Little Mermaid is a story adapted from a Danish fairy tale, just like Mulan is adapted from a Chinese folk tale. That\u2019s why the live-action remake of Mulan cast all Asian actors to complete the film. I won\u2019t say there is no \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d or \u201cwin-over Asian market\u201d consideration in the casting for Mulan, but the casting shows the basic respect to the culture of the story. The kingdom underneath the ocean, the culture of pirates and sailing, those elements of the story clearly belong to Northern Europe. Just imagine casting an Asian girl for Tiana, I don\u2019t think that will be an accurate, respectful representation of the black people culture in New Orleans. * Commercially: The Little Mermaid animation has been such a classic. People who never even watched The Little Mermaid can easily identify Ariel. The anchoring effect of the animation Ariel is just so strong that it can easily trigger a huge backlash from the audience when Ariel is far from\u00a0*the Ariel*\u00a0they know in their life. The simple result of this backlash is people lost interest in the live-action, not buying the tickets, which leads to box-office bombs. * Politically: I understand Disney is trying to create more diversity in the industry, and I fully support that. But Disney already has one black princess that has not been remade\u2014Tiana. Why not cast Halle Bailey in that classic? I\u2019m sure she will do a great job on that. If Disney is not happy about Tiana, it can surely create another black princess, just like creating Moana as a tribute to the Polynesian. I think Disney absolutely has the capacity and ability to do that.\u00a0\u00a0  I\u2019m hoping to hear other people\u2019s opinions on this and maybe explain why Disney made this decision.", "preferred": "Do you have the same issues with the animated version having a trinidadian crab and a tropical fish in the cast?", "rejected": "The difference between the Disney remake of Mulan and Ariel, is that there are literally zero references to Ariel\u2018s ethnic or racial background.   She\u2019s a mermaid.  Furthermore, if you\u2019re going to use the origin story to justify race. Tiana shouldn\u2019t be black. I don\u2019t see you advocating for her race to be changed.  Edit:  Also wanted to comment on you bringing up the culture of pirates\u2026uh\u2026 pirates were not only white/European so ok? Castles and sailing are also not exclusive to Northern Europe."}

{"prompt": "CMV: Trans-female athletes should not be allowed to compete as females The whole reason why we have female sports, is because for biological reasons, a female athlete has a fundamental athletic disadvantage compared to a male athlete. Even if a trans-women has these advantages partially eliminated due to hormone or surgery, it can not fully replicate a lifetime of being born biologically female.

{"prompt": "CMV: Toxic Masculinity exists just as tangibly as Toxic Femininity, and it's unreasonable to focus on one over the other. First, I should explain my definition of each term, as everyone seems to interpret it differently:   \"Toxic\" refers to any substance or behaviour that, due to its excess, causes harm.  \"Masculinity\" is a collection of traits that are traditionally attributed to males due to their increased prevalence in males as opposed to females.  \"Femininity\" is a collection of traits that are traditionally attributed to females due to their increased prevalence in females as opposed to males.  Now, I recently came across a YouTube video about a conversation between feminists and men's rights activists. The topic of the existence of \"toxic masculinity\" struck a chord with me.   Traditionally male characteristics such as aggressive behaviour, stoic demeanour, and self-assurance are all characteristics that, when exhibited in excess, can be toxic. That much, I agree with.  Despite this, I believe that these traits can be exhibited in a toxic manner by females, despite it never being mentioned. Furthermore, these traits, in regulation, are incredibly helpful in certain situations.  For example, controlled aggression can be equated with being forward and honest. Overcoming fear through bravery does require an aggressive approach, as opposed to a passive one. Acting stoic and masking emotions is important in negotiations, when speaking in public, when in difficult situations, and when accomplishing tasks that outbursts of emotion would hinder.  That said, feminine traits share similar pitfalls and advantages. In my mind, they are both equally important traits to posses and regulate.  So why is one plastered all over the media, while the other one isn't?  Well, I'm of the opinion that it's because feminism, the movement that coined the term \"Toxic Masculinity,\" benefits more from pointing out the flaws in behaviours more frequently seen in men (who make up a minority of feminist groups), than from doing the same to flaws frequently seen in women (who make up the majority of said groups).  I find this bias to be unreasonable, and even harmful, as it demonises men in an unfair manner.  Now, I've never seen any prominent figure so much as mention \"Toxic Femininity,\" much less explain why it is not as relevant to talk about as its masculine counterpart.  This is where I hope that Reddit comes in. Can you offer some insight with regards to the validity of one topic after another? Maybe there's a train of thought I haven't considered yet, beyond plain confirmation bias of feminists and/or tribalism.  (Note: I consider myself an egalitarian, so I don't have anything against feminism itself, just the behaviours its members seem to exhibit, but I see how it can come across like I do.)", "preferred": "> \"Toxic\" refers to any substance or behaviour that, due to its excess, causes harm.  Hold up. Toxic masculinity or toxic femininity aren't about being 'too man' or 'too woman'. It's about being 'man' or 'woman' in a fucked up way.  Viewing being aggressive as a requirement for being male, for example, is bad *in any amount*, there are lots of situations where being any level of aggressive is a terrible idea. Being aggressive isn't really 'assertive but more', either. Being a little aggressive is different from being a lot assertive.  Similarly, viewing, say, being obedient to men as a requirement for being female isn't a more extreme version of any healthy feminine quality. It's not a matter of having too much or too little of something.  It's a matter of having a society that confuses healthy traits with unhealthy ones. That confuses assertiveness with aggression. That confuses cooperation with submission.  Healthy masculinity and femininity aren't different in terms of more or less, they're just different, and the difference is generally about not being an asshole, having empathy and boundaries.", "rejected": "Two clarifying questions:  1) What do you understand \"masculine\" traits to mean?

{"prompt": "Why do we have famous scientist-influencers like Neil Degrasse Tyson and Carl Sagan but no famous philisopher-influencers or other humanities experts on the same level? I originally wanted to ask this question in a philosophy subreddit but I don't think the rules allow for it.  I think the question could apply to lots of other humanities though.  Not sure if the tag should be interdisciplinary or humanities.", "preferred": "The question is kind of vague; first, it's unclear if you mean *living* philosophers and second, it's unclear if you mean *academic/analytic* philosophers.  With regards to the first, things like human rights, animal rights, political socialism, liberalism, capitalism, sex & gender, feminism, scientific method, computer science, linguistics, etc. are all ideas which have come into the social milieu through various philosophers (mostly dead). Whether people realise it or not, the vast majority of beliefs are articulated by a philosopher at some previous point which has trickled down to them (e.g., Plato, Kant, Aristotle, Descartes, Sartre, Mill, Wittgenstein, Rand).  But we're only talking about *living*, then there's more likely to be cultural reasons for this (e.g., science gives 'real true answers' while philosophy is just 'all opinions'), so when a scientist says something it's given more credence by society than the philosopher. But even then, Peter Singer, Slavoj Zizek, Martha Nussbaum have been incredibly influential.  With regards to the second, if we're just talking about 'philosophers' in a loose sense, I'd argue that all of the \"science\" influencers are influencers *qua* philosophy. The things people are interested in hearing them say aren't scientific truths, but end up being values, ethics, metaphysics, ontology, epistemology, etc. - things squarely in the domain of philosophy. Sure, we might get drawn in by their scientific explanations, but its the *philosophical upshots* they draw which we remember and are ultimately interested in. So when they're being influencers they are wearing a philosophy hat - they become philosophers.  But if we mean academic/analytic philosophers, there's a variety of reasons for this; society doesn't value what we do, what we do is incredibly specialised and of little interest to people outside of academia, and by and large we're incredibly dry and precise. Also there's little agreement across any subfield of philosophy; people don't want to think about questions, they just want answers, but for every utilitarian there's a kantian, a virtue ethicist, a contractarian, etc. - so society just thinks its all relative/pointless.", "rejected": "I think because we many only respect scholars after they pass?

{"prompt": "My coworkers and I feel that our HR department is refusing to keep us safe from a man known for sexual harassment. Can anything be done? I am a civil servant in a department that is approximately 90% women. We have a male department head and two male supervisors, one of whom became a supervisor in 2021. For simplicity sake, I will refer to him as John.  John has worked in this field for 8 years and in that time accumulated multiple complaints for sexual harassment. 11 of those complains have made their way to HR. A 12th complaint is currently pending response from HR. These complaints have been made by a variety of people. The complaints I know of (made to HR or our Department head) are listed below, with a TL;DR version below that.  1 - 2016. John requested 2 female employees ask their friends to sleep with him and his wife. They declined to do so, he persisted, a complaint was made to the department head who chose not to involve HR. They were told John would be spoken to and that was the end of it.  2 - 2016. John started talking about a female employees body loudly to a group of people in front of her. He made comments about her butt and what he would like to do with it. She passed this on to our department head. He told her he would have a talk with John and others present to determine if this should be presented to HR.   3 - A month after incident 2, still 2016, John made the same employee uncomfortable again. While surrounded by a group of people he asked her to join him and his wife in bed. She immediately reported this directly to HR. HR advised that John would receive consequences that were to be kept private and told the female employee that discussing the incident further would put her at risk of termination. John used this to his advantage (and continues to do so) by lying to anyone that will listen about the circumstances of this report. He tells people she made everything up (despite witnesses) and she cannot defend herself.   4 - In 2017 John used his work email to post an ad on Craigslist requesting someone join him and his wife in bed. He was reading sexually explicit emails in response at work and discussing the possibilities with another coworker. This coworker reported the incident to a supervisor, who instructed John to take down the ad and use his personal email.  5 - In 2017 John complained about a new break policy that monitored break lengths. He admitted to a female coworker that he enjoyed taking long breaks as he would go into the restroom to watch porn on his phone and masturbate. This was reported to a supervisor, who passed it on to the department head, who said he would handle the situation. I do not know what, if anything, was done at this point.   6 - In 2017 someone from a neighboring business complained to our department head after John was seen groping a woman outside and in public while wearing our logo. I believe this made it to HR as our entire department was required to do sexual harassing training.   7 - 2018. While not necessarily harassment, John attempted to have our department head change policy to prevent women from wearing high heals or make up as, according to John, both are unnecessary and distract women from doing our jobs. During this time, John was known to approach female employees and critique our appearances (he wanted us to pluck our eyebrows differently, wear a different shade of blush, not wear fingernail polish, things like that.)  8 - 2018. John texted sexually explicit pictures to a female employee. She reported the texts to a supervisor, who told her she would handle the situation. I do not know what steps were taken and neither does the employee. We do believe HR was made aware as he complained about a write up around this time and the entire department was made to do sexual harassment training.   9 - 2019. John asked out a female employee who was married to a disabled woman. She declined. John started referring to the employees spouse as various vegetables when speaking with others. This was brought to HR and the entire department was made to do sensitivity training. I don't know of any personal consequences for John.   10 - 2020. During this time John divorced his wife. He began dating a new coworker who was not aware of the type of person he is. After she ended things John attempted to retaliate by telling the department head she was submitting subpar work. She proved this was incorrect, but for a moment her job was at risk. This was not brought to HR.  11 - 2021. John sent several messages to multiple female employees telling them how beautiful they are and how he'd love to be with them. Some chose to take this to a supervisor. Some did not. No one is really sure if it went further as they were told it was handled privately.   12 - 2021. At this point John ia a supervisor. It was found that he had moved in with a subordinate. He was temporarily stripped of his title and HR investigated. They agreed that he could return to his position as supervisor if he ended the relationship with his subordinate.  13 - 2022. John was speaking inappropriately to a female employee about her body. She asked him to stop. He responded by offering a tampon since, according to John, she must be on her period to have such an attitude. This was reported to HR.   14 - 2022. John began sending inappropriate messages to a female employee. She explained that she is not attracted to men and asked that he stop. He continued messaging her and started describing what he would do to her to make her like men, all very sexual. She told him she would go to HR and he told her to go for it as he'd already been investigated 11 times and he was untouchable each time. This has been going on since early March. A month ago she went to another supervisor asking for any help and John got wind of it. He began reporting her work as unacceptable to the department head. She was pulled in and told she had 90 days to improve or she'd be terminated. She proved the complaints made against her were false and they were dropped. She called HR to make a complaint directly and was told she'd be called back. It's been 2 weeks and she's called multiple times. No one has returned her calls.  TL;DR: Male coworker has multiple incidents of sexual harassment. I know of 14 separate issues. He has, by his own admission, been investigated by HR 11 times. Nothing is being done. Our mostly female office feels unsafe around him. He feels untouchable. Is there anything that can be done? Can we threaten legal action against our HR department? Or our Department Head? Or him? Does he have to physically assault someone before any real action can be taken?", "preferred": "Tl;dr- I\u2019m a lawyer but not your lawyer. Go get one.

If a person\u2019s conduct at work is so harassing, pervasive, and targets a protected class or right (gender among them, which includes sexual harassment) it can create a hostile work environment, which is against the law. If your work does nothing to stop it, or not enough to stop it, they will be held liable and required to do something about it (possibly provide compensation as well).   Get a real employment lawyer to learn the details of your case and navigate the specifics. You need to go to the EEOC or the state agency that handles these claims.

Given John's pervasive history I would imagine there are a lot more incidents that haven't been brought to light."}

{"prompt": "Does anybody feel like academic publication pressure is becoming unsustainable? I am becoming very frustrated with the publication culture in my field. Becoming an expert takes a long time and so is making a valuable contribution to the literature.  However, publication pressure is turning many contributions into spin-offs that are slightly different from the publication before, and they are often redundant. Further, a failed experiment would never get published but it would actually provide insight to peers as to what route not to explore. I think that publication pressure is overwhelming for academics and in detriment of scientific literature.  I feel like we seriously need to rethink the publication reward system.  Does anybody have thoughts on this?", "preferred": "Academic system is all fucked up. I regret sincerely that I chose this career. I hate it and it keeps getting worse.

I completely agree with the notion that there are too many papers and definitely way too many \u201cincremental\u201d papers.   But it is worth thinking g about the causes of this.   In my mind the main driver of all of this is that the job market is ultra-competitive. Most fields produce an order of magnitude (or more!) PhDs than they have TT openings. As such there is a massive culling at the postdoctoral level and then at the Assistant Professor level.   Now of course some fields are not training PhDs to necessarily go into academia but many are and in those cases this pressure applies.   For example in my department we regularly get 500+ applications for every TT opening. This is very typical for my field and many others.   So you need some criteria to separate people and at that scale it will obviously not be a subtle or thoughtful process. Counting pubs is obviously not an optimal algorithm but if we didn\u2019t do that, we would need some other metric. Letters? We get 500x3 letters, how to separate those? Etc.   And that\u2019s not to mention grants and in particular final grant reports. If you are writing the final report for a $400,000 grant, you better have something listed there. Pubs is usually the thing  Another issue is something that has occurred more recently, but it\u2019s that now many places that aren\u2019t really research schools at all now require a solid publication record for tenure. In my opinion this is unwise but faculty doing research is good for a small school\u2019s prestige.  Obviously this trend is an outgrowth of the factors mentioned above."}
{"prompt": "CMV: Political Parties should be abolished Democrat, Republican, Libertarian, Green Party, etc. They should all be annihilated from the face of the planet.  Political Parties are tools of oppression and gridlock. Nothing ever gets done in congress because everyone votes along party lines, instead of what they actually believe in or what their constituents voted them in for. If there were no political parties, something, ANYTHING, would actually be done. Not only that, but we as voters would have more flexible options on what to do on certain issues. Instead of a binary, all or nothing approach towards triggering topics like abortion, gun control, immigration, and so on, we'd have comprehensive solutions that actually address the issue, instead of political catchphrases that hold no water and are dead on arrival.   Not only that, but parties often become centered one person or ideal, with anyone not toeing the party line seen as a traitor. Look at John McCain with Trump, or Kyrsten Sinema with Biden. Hell, the republican party, despite being besieged and their lives endangered just a few months ago, are trying to sweep the insurrection under the rug per orders from the top. Without this blind adherence to party, they'd be able to say what they feel and not be trapped in their cult.  The argument FOR political parties is that they help organize people and galvanize them towards action. But that organization is laid to waste with gridlock and sometimes even corrupted, with partisan gerrymandering being one of the most ridiculous things ever made (and another casualty of us having parties at all). As for galvanization, surely people would be more inclined to vote if they had more than two options? And the options weren't about red or blue, but actual character, history, and policy?

Say you have a hypothetical legislature with no political parties. Every single member got their on their own merit, solely supporting their own ideas, etc. Now put that legislature into action. Individual members will introduce bills/motions they want to pass. They'll then try to convince other members to support them. Maybe Jones has a bill she really wants to pass and Williams agrees to support it, but only if Jones will also support Williams' bill. Now the two of them go around and get support from more and more members, each of whom has their own priorities they want the others to support in exchange for their votes. Now maybe this coalition gets big enough that they're only a handful of members shy of passing everything every member wants, but they can't convince anyone else to join them. However, there's an election coming up. So they go to the district of one of the members who won't support them and find someone who *will* support their coalition. They donate some money and give support to help that person defeat the uncooperative member. Now the coalition has 1 more vote on their side. Pretty soon they're doing this same operation in every district to get as many votes on their side as possible.  A political party has just formed spontaneously.

Get the guy a stirrup hoe. They're stupid easy to use and fast and effective. You basically 'rub' the end of it on the ground and it'll cut the weeds at the surface level. I made my own but they aren't terribly expensive to purchase.   The interesting thing is that there are tons of good ways to make your own herbicides and pesticides from things around you. Once you understand how plants work, you can easily design something to disrupt that and get rid of them. There are vinegar based herbicides that work well and aren't so horrible for the environment. You can also use a propane torch to get rid of weeds as well.   It's sad to watch people get hosed by companies to do things they don't need. I absolutely fucking love watching people apply broad leaf killer to get rid of all the clovers just to pay the company to come back and apply a high nitrogen fertilizer. Clovers will naturally bring nitrogen back to the soil as they grow for the season and die in the fall. There's a slew of edible plants that grow in yards that we kill with pesticides.

DUBNER:\u00a0The Piraha live in huts, sleep on the ground, hunt with bows and arrows. But what really caught Everett\u2019s attention is that they are relentlessly happy. Really happy.  EVERETT:\u00a0This happiness and this contentment really had a lot to do with me abandoning my religious goals, and my religion altogether, because they seemed to have it a lot more together than most religious people I knew.  DUBNER:\u00a0But this isn\u2019t just another story about some faraway tribe that\u2019s really happy even though they don\u2019t have all the stuff that we have. It\u2019s a story about something that happened during Everett\u2019s early days with the tribe. He and his wife and their three young kids had just finished dinner. Everett gathered about thirty Piraha in his hut to preach to them.  EVERETT:\u00a0I was still a very fervent Christian missionary, and I wanted to tell them how God had changed my life.  So, I told them a story about my stepmother and how she had committed suicide because she was so depressed and so lost, for the word depressed I used the word sad. So she was very sad. She was crying. She felt lost. And she shot herself in the head, and she died. And this had a large spiritual impact on me, and I later became a missionary and came to the Piraha because of all of this experience triggered by her suicide. And I told this story as tenderly as I could, and tried to communicate that it had a huge impact on me. And when I was finished everyone burst out laughing.  [THEME]  ANNOUNCER:\u00a0From WNYC and APM, American Public Media, this is Freakonomics Radio. Today: The Suicide Paradox. Here\u2019s your host, Stephen Dubner.  DUBNER:\u00a0All right, so Dan Everett was sharing this sad, intimate story about his step-mother\u2019s suicide with the Piraha \u2026  EVERETT:\u00a0When I asked them why are you laughing, they said: \u201cShe killed herself. That\u2019s really funny to us. We don\u2019t kill ourselves. You mean, you people, you white people shoot yourselves in the head? We kill animals, we don\u2019t kill ourselves.\u201d They just found it absolutely inexplicable, and without precedent in their own experience that someone would kill themselves.  DUBNER:\u00a0In the thirty years that Everett has been studying the Piraha, there have been zero suicides.

This is unfair to the children who actual take school seriously and want to learn as well as the teachers who are forced deal with the added stress of problem students.

{"prompt": "I believe that taking a course in Statistics is more valuable for the average High School senior than taking a class in Calculus. CMV Our graduating class has approximately 400 students. Of those, nearly 250 are taking either Advanced Placement Calculus AB or BC. On the other hand there is one class of AP Statistics offered at our campus and it has less than thirty students in total. Almost half of those are Sophomores or Juniors.  I am taking Statistics as a class, and learning Calculus on my own time. I'm taking Statistics because I believe that it will benefit me to have a basic knowledge of how data can be skewed or manipulated in order to produce certain results.

I am learning Calculus because I do a bit of computer programming (we've actually used a bit of what we've learned already in some applications we're writing), and I will also need to take several Calculus courses in college for the degree I intend to pursue, some of which might actually be credited by a good score on the AP exam.  The thing is, a bunch of people taking the Calculus course don't need it. They're just taking the class because the previous math class was called \"Pre-Calculus,\" and they need a total of four Mathematics credits to graduate High School. Some of these people will be getting degrees that have nothing to do with Calculus, or working positions that don't require a degree. The class is unnecessarily complicated, and provides them with information that is entirely useless to their lives. They would be better served by being able to look at a study and saying \"Ha, that doesn't mean anything.\" The ability to look at data or surveys and determine what, if anything, they mean is a valuable skill that many people would be well served by.

The point of these classes is not the subject matter, but the ability to reason mathematically. To that end, I don't think it matters whether you teach them calculus or number theory, anything they actually *need* is going to be taught to them in college anyway.  If you want a math class that can be taught at a high-school level and is \"more useful\" than calculus, I would suggest linear algebra.  And besides, what is the \"average\" high school senior anyway? Do you mean \"median\", \"mean\" or some other kind of average?", "rejected": "When you take calculus, you grok Algebra, Geometry, and Trig. You understand why you use X formula to find the surface area of a triangle, or the volume of a sphere, and you can figure out the formula if you forgot it. That said, Statistics is also important, especially for medicine, science, and journalism. IMO, the math curriculum is stupidly slow until you get to high school, and many basic principles of calculus can be taught at a much younger age. You don't have to know algebra to learn that increasing the number of sides of a regular polygon will make the shape approach a circle.  tl;dr: Why not both?"}

{"prompt": "CMV: Being transgender is a medical condition, and some aspects of the current trans rights movement, along with non-binary identities, are making things worse for us. I'm a 25-year-old trans man. I've read scientific papers such as this which conclude that gender dysphoria is a neurological condition with possible genetic and biological causes. From all of the scientific and medical research (including MRIs, genetic data, etc.) about gender dysphoria and transsexualism that I've found, I haven't seen anything that suggests that non-binary, genderfluid, agender, etc. exist. Furthermore, only 0.6% of Americans identify as transgender and I think that the visibility and activism surrounding trans people needs to take this into consideration.   Due to the fact that I haven't seen any objective studies about non-binary people, I can only give anecdotes based on my experiences in my local and online trans community. Transition-wise, I have been on testosterone for over a year, legally changed my name and gender marker everywhere, fully socially transitioned, and have had chest surgery. Most of the non-binary, genderqueer, agender, etc. people I've met through online Facebook groups and in social and support groups in my city are white, born female, and from middle-class or affluent backgrounds. On the other hand, in my experience, binary transsexuals (meaning FTM or MTF) hail from a diversity of racial and socioeconomic backgrounds. I've talked to several different non-binary people about what being non-binary means to them and what caused them to identify that way. Each one has their own unique spin on what NB means to them. Many of them claim NB because they were born female and prefer men's clothing and haircuts, so to them this signifies that they are not women.   Gender identity, gender roles, and gender expression are three completely different things. Gender identity is centered around the body's sexed characteristics and informed by neurology and genetics, gender roles describe the (oftentimes arbitrary) behavior of men and women in various social contexts, and gender expression indicates how your personal demeanor/dress/lifestyle squares up with masculinity and femininity. Since being transgender means that you identify as the gender opposite of the one corresponding with your birth sex, determining \"am I trans?\" should center around how one feels about their body's sexed characteristics. I am a trans man because I am viscerally uncomfortable with having a vagina, breasts, high-pitched voice, female reproductive organs, etc. It has less to do with liking men's clothing or faded haircuts, since obviously women can partake in these things and still be women, since they are presumably also happy with their vaginas and breasts.   Other non-binary people seek hormones and surgery like FTMs/MTFs do. These often claim (if born female) that they aren't trans men because they don't identify with \"toxic masculinity\". One Latino NB in my support group is on testosterone and has gotten chest surgery but says he isn't a man because his father and older brothers like soccer, drinking, and \"machismo\" culture and he isn't like them since he prefers video games and comics. Guess I have to tell half the guys on my social media that they aren't really men since they don't like sports and boozing. As you can see, many non-binary people ironically have a reductive, 1950s view of gender where being a boy means wearing flannel and liking trucks and being a girl means makeup and quieter hobbies. This is harmful for FTM and MTF trans people since it reduces our genders to a set of personality traits and demedicalizes our condition.   The next problem with the modern trans movement concerns the social contract. As I said before, only 0.6% of Americans identify as transgender. Of course, with the unknown population of stealth trans people who do not identify as trans since they view transition as a process that should be put behind you as quickly as possible, there's no clear way to know how many trans people truly exist. However, it's not a foregone conclusion to believe that most people who look like men are men (cis or trans) and that most people who look like women are women (cis or trans). Therefore, there's typically no real need to ask people's pronouns when you first meet them. At my workplace's transgender sensitivity training, planned in advance of my coming out at work, the facilitator urged everyone to ask for the pronouns of any new person you meet. Obviously this was met with confusion and hostility, especially since most of the people at my job are conservative middle-aged people who can barely conceptualize homosexuality. Increasingly, when I meet new people at parties and events, there's a \"pronoun circle\" where everyone has to say their name and pronoun. At first this upset me since I thought I was being \"clocked\" as a gender-indeterminate person who no one knew how to address, and I wish to pass as a cis man and be stealth. But apparently it's slowly becoming part of social introductions in some places. Many trans people pass as their target gender, or else they will correct you if you misgender them. I don't see the need to modify basic introductions to accommodate less than 1% of the population when it honestly isn't all that needed. Also, pronoun circles can offend gender-nonconforming cis people who identify as fem men/masculine women, closeted and pre-transition people who now have to assert an incorrect gender and experience dysphoria, and passing and stealth trans people who see transition as a shitty medical thing they had to get through and just want to live their life. I know of a couple of stealth trans guys who have had SRS and experienced severe dysphoria with their natal genitals to the point where they would constantly have UTIs and bedwetting problems since they simply could not interact with their vaginas at all. They needed grief and trauma counseling since being born female gave them PTSD symptoms. Pronoun circles only serve to trigger their dysphoria and remind them of their past.   Then comes the \"not all men have penises, not all women have vaginas\" axiom. This is obviously true. However, we say that humans have 10 fingers and toes, two eyes and ears, etc. though of course we know there are medical anomalies to this. We say the sky is blue and grass is green but of course this isn't always the case. Further, most trans women don't want to have penises and most trans men don't want to have vaginas, that's what having dysphoria means. Reminding me that some men have uteruses and periods only reminds me of parts that make me dysphoric, it's not helpful at all. Cis men don't have uteruses and periods, that's the whole point of going on testosterone and getting a hysterectomy. In my experience, most of the people encouraging pronoun circles and intentionally reminding trans people of triggering aspects of their bodies are non-binary/agender/genderfluid/etc. As previously stated, many of these people do not experience dysphoria and therefore don't understand the actual FTM/MTF transsexual experience. It's akin to video game nerds taking over the autistic community and claiming that all autistic people are just shy nerdy kids, and not people with a serious neurological condition.   Finally, in my opinion, non-binary people, and any trans person who claims to not have dysphoria, do not belong in the trans community. Obviously people are free to believe and identify however they wish, but these people have never been scientifically or medically studied and from what I can see they don't fit into any logical transsexual schemas. Rather, their conflation with us mostly harms dysphoric transsexual people through encouraging us to have a nebulous trans identity rather than simply being a woman or a man with an unusual medical history. Given that they seem to be predominantly white, born female, and from middle-class or affluent backgrounds, I think one could infer that these are the kids who would have been punks/goths/emo/scene in earlier decades. They have settled into co-opting trans identities in a quixotic quest to be interesting and iconoclastic.   I think that being FTM/MTF should be seen as a medical condition, and the trans community should refocus on medical treatment and social/emotional support for people transitioning and coping with dysphoria. The general population should only learn that it is a serious medical condition and to simply respect trans people's (binary) genders and medical privacy.", "preferred": "> Most of the non-binary, genderqueer, agender, etc. people I've met through online Facebook groups and in social and support groups in my city are white, born female, and from middle-class or affluent backgrounds. On the other hand, in my experience, binary transsexuals (meaning FTM or MTF) hail from a diversity of racial and socioeconomic backgrounds.   I honestly think the whole genderqueer/non-binary thing is born from (mostly) women feeling profoundly uncomfortable/dysphoric with their gender roles and place in society without necessarily being dysphoric about their bodies. While I am conflicted whether the NB spectrum could fit under the trans umbrella, I think it's absolutely worth studying why so many young afabs/women with masculine interests just aren't satisfied being 'tom boys' or 'butch' anymore. I think a lot of women identify with queer movements because they also feel shunned by gender roles/expression and heteronormative society. And I don't think it's a coincidence that most nb people are born female and most are queer in other ways (99% of the nb people I have met are bi or pansexual). I do think that identifying as NB helps a lot of bi/pan female people, who are often told that they don't belong in the LGBT community, feel like they belong just a little bit more and work through the complexities of homo/biphobia and misogyny. If they associate some of the poor treatment they have gotten with being a woman, they see this as a way to opt out of sexism and reconnect with queer communities. I would love to see a long-term study on this.   However, I do find some of the rhetoric behind NB movements alarming. Some really do treat it like the whole \"I'm not like other girls\" trope turned up to 11. You can drink whiskey, smoke cigars, drive fast cars, like sports, cut your hair, and wear flannel while being a woman... it's sexist to me to imply that women can't do these things and this seems to be an implication in a lot of discourse about NB identities. There are also a lot of implications that it's 'the same' as binary transition when it's pretty clear that it's not as you've very nicely lined out. But I do think that NB identities and the 'dysphoria' NB people have around gender roles/expression are worth discussing. Maybe as its own thing, or maybe alongside discourse about physical binary transition. But the fact that a lot of people, females in particular (there are NB males, but they seem far less common) have latched onto that movement tells me something is going on with the way our culture is perceiving gender and that we should learn to handle it.", "rejected": "...so you think that people who are trans but not on the binary should be erased from the conversation?

{"prompt": "Positive experiences with PhD/Academia? Hi!   I'm a grad student, planning on doing a PhD. Whenever I tallk to my friends who do/have done PhDs they often tell me the experience made them miserable. Most of them abandoned the project of an academic career afterwards. Likewise, my Facebook feed is saturated with with those \"Shit Academics Say\" types of pages, rife with self-deprecating humor and grim jokes about depression and burn-outs.

I know you asked about grad work but I think the job search was the most stressful and depressing part of my grad / postdoc time. During my search for the elusive tenure track position I felt like all I read was negative comments about how so many folks spent several cycles looking for positions without success. Further, I have the two body problem with a spouse in a very similar field. So finding TWO jobs in the same area (according to the internet) was just impossible and one of us should just accept being an adjunct or stay-at-home parent the rest of our lives. The reality... I don't think the happy people post much online. Most of the long winded blogs and posts are frustrated people looking to vent their frustration. The folks happy in their graduate work, or in the job search are doing those things and probably don't have time to write about it. Like me, right now... I should be doing actual work.  This is obviously one very specific situation, but I found a tenure track position and my spouse found a visiting that has now turned tenure track and both are within reasonable commuting distances at two separate institutions. I think what helped was that we were reasonable in our expectations - that is, we identified what we wanted to do (teach and research) and we didn't limit ourselves when applying. We took advice from others but paid attention to where it was coming from. For example a PI at an R1 institution is going to frown at heavier teaching loads and tell you not to waste time with teaching because it detracts from research. But I had a TA and I trained undergrads and it helped me land this position.. which is an undergrad only institution with a major focus on undergraduate research. So if you're looking for happy people, count me as one.

{"prompt": "How faithfully do oral traditions retell events? Hi all,  I was wondering if there has been work that discusses how faithfully stories in oral traditions are passed down through the generations. I ask this mainly because, I imagine that initially when an event happens and is told as a story, it might not be as \"fantastic\" as we often hear in the retellings that survive. So would the parts that seem fanciful to us now be exaggerations that were added throughout the many retellings? Or am I going about this the wrong way? Thanks a lot for your help.", "preferred": "Just as an addendum to the other posts here: in the modern Western world we claim to place great emphasis on \"history\" and \"accuracy.\" But even in popular Western culture we have the phrase, \"History is written by the victors.\" That's basically a tacit acknowledgement that in fact we're not really interested in the facts.  We often claim to value accuracy and reliability of historical accounts, but the reality-- and even our own sayings-- contradicts this myth. We value historical accounts that reinforce our own world view(s). And we massage and selectively edit history to fit our narratives.  Hence, Thomas Jefferson is revered as a polymath statesman who wrote the Declaration of Independence and helped create the United States government, and not reviled as a hypocrite slaveowner who raped a 14 year old girl repeatedly and fathered several children with her (they and she remaining slaves despite being his children and the mother to his children).  That's not to say that oral traditions do not contain information that can be overlaid on the real world / cross-checked. We can see this in, for example, the relatively recent study of Australian Aboriginal stories, and evidence that those stories preserve memories of sea level rise / inundation of the landscape more than 7,000 years ago.  But just one look at Facebook and the struggle with fake news makes it pretty clear that **we** collectively don't value objective, factual accounts of historical or modern events as much as we like to pretend we do.

In close studies of African griots he found oral tradition is quite flexible, and written tradition more stable, though as some others point out, written tradition can also be flexible, it just takes longer to change. In \"The World of Odysseus\", Moses Finley, points out that while many Bronze age details enrich the Homeric epics, the more mundane background details of the works reflect daily life the original audience at the time of their composition in the Iron Age.To answer your question more directly, when stories are retold, and retold, not only do they become more fanciful, they become more inaccurate (relative to the actual events and/or the first version). Heroes become villains, and the reverse. The \"outs\" become the \"ins\", ordinary things become magnified (the fish keeps getting bigger!), and events and people become confused and conflated. In \"The Nibelugenlied\" or \"The Song of Roland\" you will find things from different eras all co-existing in the mythic \"story-time\".

I'm really sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, but I feel like my sentiments can only really be understood by people in my field.  A few years ago, after a soul rending 9 month job hunt, I landed a job two orders of magnitude better than I thought I'd ever get.

I buy 8 books on the topic and take two weeks of vacation to read them all without telling my boss what I really did on vacation.   14 months pass. The sense of job fatigue I was counting on happening to me STILL wasn't happening. All that was starting to happen was the occasional piece of emotional fatigue that was caused by dealing with irrational coworkers and typical kinds of office politics. It quickly went away, and the sense that I was doing something wrong had returned. At home, I have no energy. My apartment started to increase in disorder. I set my bills to autopay, knowing that the time lost to dealing with intentionally confusing bill paying systems would cost me more than the equivalent amount of time that I could have gotten by just working more overtime for that duration. I'm bored. I'm miserable. Everybody I know around here is already married, or only does socially interactive activites that cause me physical discomfort such as strenuous excersize or binge drinking, or even worse... Golf.   I conclude that my improvement must have been happening too fast and that the work I was doing wasn't challenging enough for me. I show my boss what I knew how to do now and he agrees to let me take on even more work in hopes that it keeps me satisfied. At this point it's clear that he's terrified of losing me. He wasn't expecting my level of development at all. I got a significant raise out of the blue a week or so later and all I was really able to think about was \"oh NICE I'll finally be able to afford these books I was meaning to get.\"   I visit my family for the first time since I started work and it's nice, but I can't stop thinking about work. I can't stop talking about work. Every third sentence made its way back to engineering without me realizing it and everyone in my family quickly grew sick of it. I wasn't even trying to talk about it.   I get back from vacation and I need more distractions from life so I ask for more work and recieve it. By the fourth week of the new schedule it's back to only taking me 40 hours to do all of the tasks and the nihilistic dread sets back in.   The sense of job exhaustion I needed to happen to force me to stop working like a madman and seek relationships with other people still, despite everything, hadn't happened yet.   Then the plague hit.   I'm essential.   I've spent an average of 65 hours a week at work for an average of 6.2 days per week from May 2020 to today, January 10 2021. All of my reading has to be done at work now because I was finally given access to the small library of internal company documentation on all the little ins and outs of how to do my job properly down to the last nitty gritty detail. None of that reading comprised any part of those 65 hours per week.   In June, I ask my boss for more work. I tell him that no matter how hard I try, the paniced and overwhelmed feeling of having too much work to do has never come, and I ask him what else I can do to get better because at this point I haven't felt satisfied in weeks. He tells me the worst thing I've ever heard.   \"I'll be honest, about our current job, I've got nothing else to teach you. You're doing great, beyond great, and in every way that matters, you probably know more than me now.\"   I... do not take this well. I ask him why he was lying to me. It's fucking impossible that he wasn't lying to me, he had 20 years more experience than me, but he insisted I'd read every book he'd ever heard of, and that all there was left was to gain more experience. What the fuck am I supposed to do about that, wait?! I tried re-igniting hobbies. Nothing stuck.   It's been a few months since then. I'm still working trying to get that fix but it never comes. I haven't seen my family in 15 months and the scariest part of all of this is that I'm honestly feeling okay.   I feel like that character in Isaac Asimov's Foundation and Empire whose brain is being cooked to death by a telepath constantly giving him a feeling of being right on the verge of a massive breakthrough but that feeling of breakthrough never happens.   I feel like I could do this forever. The only way to get the feeling of discovery at this point is to just do analysis practice on my own. Everyone at work that I speak to doesn't understand that I'd rather die than go back to college for a higher degree than a bachelors at this point, and all of them either keep pretending like there's nothing left I could possibly learn or tell me to read books I've already read.  I can't imagine anything more fun than what I'm doing right now and I'm appearantly very good at it. The only things I can imagine doing right now that would bring me more joy is trying to settle down and start a family, but despite everything, I still don't feel like I'm ready for that yet even though there's almost nothing I want to do more. You can't train that. I'm lost.   He's mentioned that I should try to ask him for another raise if I'm unsatisfied but there's nothing left I can buy that will scratch the itch at this point. The though of leaving my work unattended only fills me with fear at this point; not relief.    I can't vacation to see my family without the threat of killing them, and no matter  how badly I want to see them, I know I'll only be able to think about work while  I'm there. I can't turn it off.   I can't prevent others from continuing to worsen the pandemic without breaking laws.   I can't reunite with my friends from college without hating myself because it devolves into me spewing about my work for hours on end    I don't know how to be this systemically satisfied but also so specifically miserable.   What should I do?", "preferred": "You definitely sound like someone who somehow ended up getting paid to work on a hobby you obsess over. That's not that big a deal, but that does make you different. Your life isn't going to fit with the advice everyone tries to give you, because you're not going to have the same problems other people do. So stop feeling any kind of shame over that and work towards understanding how you're different and how you can use that knowledge to strategize your life and your relationship with others.  Do understand that you are very unique in ways that most other people won't quite understand unless you spell it out to them. Even your coworkers. Evidently even your boss as well. I don't know a whole lot about the technical aspects of addiction, but it almost seems like you are addicted to your work (not necessarily the job, but the work).  One important thing to recognize is that you being different from others means that others are different from you. Your coworkers and your boss don't have the same obsession with the work that you do. Their advice is coming from that perspective. Their worries seem like they're coming from people that don't realize that you actually enjoy doing this stuff and don't realize that this isn't work for you in the same way that it's work for them. If you haven't made that distinction clear to them, you should. And maybe ease off on pressuring your coworkers and bosses to feed your obsession, because doing shit like accusing them of lying when they say they don't have enough for you is not helping. You've surpassed everyone to the point where they can't even ask you to do stuff fast enough to keep you busy.  It's not great that your sole relationship seems to be with your work, but that's because variety is a safety net that can prevent one thing from dominating your emotions, and having other things to fall back on is nice. Think of what may happen if your work all of a sudden becomes less enjoyable. Is that going to plunge you into a depression because the one thing you've devoted all your time to is making you sad? It's not so much the fact that you don't have \"normal\" relationships that is worrying as much as it is your reliance on one solitary thing to satisfy you.  It's also worrying that you seem to be neglecting your home life. Again I'm not talking about relationships, but I am talking about your apartment getting more disordered or you saying you don't have time to pay bills. It's almost like your home life is work instead of your work life. So you have to approach your home life like the rest of us approach work: you have to work at it. You have to budget time to tidy up or check on your bills or deal with the emotional fatigue caused by other stuff. You're not getting paid for it, but you're sure as hell getting paid enough from the stuff you enjoy that you're not gonna starve if you drop from 65 hours a week to 60 or so to deal with other shit. If you're not going to deal with them because they're important, deal with them to get them done and out of the way so you can go back to focusing on work. Deal with them because they're distractions and distractions should be dealt with properly before they become bigger distractions and REALLY take you away from the stuff you want to do.  I think it would be worth talking to a therapist about all this. At worst you'll have someone else to talk to about work. And talking it through with a professional might help you narrow down things like what you're actually afraid of when you're not obsessing about work and how you might strategize accordingly. They'll be able to ask you better questions, and you'll be able to talk more specifics without having those specifics out on the open internet for all to read. Again, the goal here is for you to better understand yourself and find a way to help you feel better about the unique situation you find yourself in, not to \"fix\" you like there's something wrong with you.", "rejected": "Do something else for work..."}

{"prompt": "CMV: Technologically driven productivity gains will make Universal Basic Income so cheap it will be non controversial and inevitable. Technological improvements are on the verge of making the basics of life so inexpensive that a Universal Basic Income sufficient to cover simple living requirements will be non controversial and all governments of developed nations will implement it by 2070.  Robotized agriculture and vertical farming (of genetically engineered super foods like vat grown meat), 3D printed housing, and even clothing will become so cheap that it will be trivial for governments to fund a UBI to cover food, clothing and shelter. Self driving cars and drone delivery will further drop the costs of transportation and delivery making it easy for people to live even in remote areas that have low costs of living.  As costs of food, clothing and shelter keep falling the price of a UBI becomes a low burden for tax-payers making the implementation of such a system easy to do politically, particularly since it can allow the elimination of other safety net programs at the same time.  That said, UBI may do little to eliminate inequality, which may actually increase substantially. Technological improvements will keep reducing the need for low skilled work while simultaneously increasing demand, and compensation, for people with even higher levels of education and specialized skills. The value of educations for anything other than these increasingly specialized fields will be minimal.  Perhaps there will be new careers for jobs we can't yet foresee, but that may take time to evolve. Increasing productivity will may demand for creative jobs in entertainment. Caring jobs, like nursing, will likely also continue to be in demand since these will be particularly difficult to automate.  Major advances in medicine could also lead to greater inequality as only the wealthy would be able to afford increasingly exotic life saving, and extending, treatments.  But increasing inequality is beside the point of my premise that the creation of a UBI in most developed nations is virtually inevitable within the next 50 years. In fact, growing inequality likely makes UBI an even greater possibility.", "preferred": "There is no evidence that economic productivity is about to shoot up or increase faster than it is.

However, I don't think UBI is inevitable. History has shown that people like power, and wealth, and I think if we become complacent, and don't push for a solution, it could result in a very different future. Maybe one greatly influenced by powerful mega corporations, or a handful of elites - who don't see UBI as beneficial to them.  For me UBI seems very promising, but there are alternatives which could unfold (Note: I'm not saying these are better, just that they could occur, thus making UBI not inevitable)  1. Expanding current welfare programs 2. (UBI minus the universal), so basic income that is means tested in some way (e.g. only people below a living standard) 3. Corporations compensating people based on the value of user data (in terms of advertising). 4. Compensation based on social score (think China)"}
{"prompt": "I suspect I might have participated in a rigged search, this time as a candidate! Mostly just venting but would be happy to hear others' thoughts on this. Since this is \"ask\" academia my question is: \"am I just being paranoid?\"  Several years ago I was on the search committee side of a hiring situation where the top candidate was clear to nearly all members of the committee but the provost had already decided on one person and we eventually learned that we were there just to rubber-stamp the process. I remember being livid at the time--not only had the committee's time been wasted but it felt so incredibly *unjust*. The fact that the \"chosen\" candidate was not only an arrogant ass but also less-qualified than the committee's recommend candidate made it even worse.  Fast forward to a position I recently learned I would not be offered. I went all the way through a nearly day-long (Zoom-based) \"campus\" visit, presentation, met with all department faculty individually or in small groups, conversation with the dean, etc. Early on I had my suspicions about the position (red flags listed below) but the faculty I interacted with seemed genuinely interested in me/my work and had nothing but positive feedback for me.   I was actually somewhat surprised to receive a rejection e-mail post-interview. The qualifications were quite narrow/focused but I met them all. The application window was so short I couldn't imagine that many qualified people applied, especially since it wasn't advertised in my field's typical venues. Then my thoughts turned to my own experience on the other side of the search process--I had been just as enthusiastic about the *real* top candidate as those faculty I recently met with were enthusiastic about me. Even though that previous search was truly a sham, most of the people involved in the search process weren't aware until we'd already met the candidates and discussed the pros and cons of each. What if the same thing happened here?  Anyway, maybe I'm just being paranoid, or don't handle rejection well, but...the red flags:  * The position was never listed in my field's primary job advertisement venue, only on the university's HR site and the Chronicle of Higher Ed jobs site.   * The application period was open for only one month.  * They asked if it was okay to call my references but never contacted any of them. IME in my field references are usually contacted for all finalist candidates.  * The start date was mid-academic-year and only about 3 months after the application close date. The successful candidate would need to either be unemployed or have an extremely flexible position (thankfully I have the latter) to be able to start mid-year. Or already be on campus...  * There's a long-time adjunct in this department with specific (course name/number) teaching duties identical to the courses listed in the job advertisement, with exactly the course load stated in the job ad. The adjunct's spouse has an upper-level administrative position at the same university.  Any one of these alone I would brush off, but I've been on the other side of a process that felt very similar. I also think that this happens more frequently than we might expect--I know of a handful of cases like this. In fact, now that I think of it I can think of four cases off the top of my head where I was at least tangentially affected, either on a search committee or in a department, by a rigged search that was either attempted or successfully carried out. (The score is 2-2 if you're curious).   What I suspect here is that the \"candidate\" already on campus was promised this position but according to the institution's rules, they had to do a national search. I happened upon the job listing just by chance and they had to play along; maybe having me in the pool even helped at some level. Faculty and many/most committee members were in the dark until the final \"decision\" had to be made.  As I wrote at the beginning, this is mostly just me venting. It may just be me coping with rejection. The position was really ideal, though--I've never seen such a perfect fit (from me-as-candidate point of view). This might be one of the final straws that gets me out of academia.

{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old: Why is that cars don't get significantly more fuel efficient year by year?", "preferred": "Law of diminishing returns. You can only squeeze so much efficiency out of a combustible engine. For the design of a specific car, it has its weight and aerodynamics to contend with. Those values are mostly static.", "rejected": "There are some serious limits imposed on fuel efficiency by the way engines work. Diesels tend to be better and there is potential for improved gas mileage with new technologies, but it is not leaps and bounds.  Gas mileage is fundamentally limited in cities by the speed limit, mean free path, and mass of the car. On the highway, it is aerodynamics.  Aerodynamics haven't changed much in the last 40 years, especially in the subsonic domain, so that's that.  Lighter cars aren't really an option - they're already pretty light. Changing the mean free path and speed limits of cars is a city planning issue and not an engineering issue.  The only real solution is to find a different way to power our cars. Regenerative braking in electric or hybrid vehicles seeks to do this by getting power back from the brakes, making a significant difference in city driving."}

I've also found a few recipes that use both, what's your opinion on that?", "preferred": "In general, I prefer ground milk chocolate. Ghirardelli makes a nice one. It melts during baking, so it achieves a really nice mouth feel and very pronounced chocolatey flavor. That said, when making big-batch brownies for a restaurant, my best recipe calls for cocoa.

{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old: Why do double minuses become positive, and two pluses never make a negative?", "preferred": "Presumably you're talking about multiplication. The reason is that we just extend a simple pattern.  * 5x3 = 15 * 4x3 = 12 * 3x3 = 9 * 2x3 = 6  * 1x3 = 3  We start off with five 3s, and have one few lot of three each time, so the answer reduces by 3. That means we can carry on the pattern:  * 5x3 = 15 * 4x3 = 12 * 3x3 = 9 * 2x3 = 6  * 1x3 = 3 * 0x3 = 0 * -1 x 3 = -3 * -2 x 3 = -6  This makes sense, because '-2x3' means we have negative two lots of 3, or equivalently three lots of -2 (and -2 + -2 + -2 = -6). What happens if we reduce the number of -2s?  * -2 x 3 = -6 * -2 x 2 = -4 * -2 x 1 = -2 * -2 x 0 = 0 * -2 x -1 = 2 * -2 x -2 = 4  And so on. So by extending the pattern into the negatives, we see that 'positive times negative is negative', because we have a negative number lots of times. By then extending the other way, we see that 'negative times negative is positive', because we have a negative number a negative number of times (if you follow).   Positives embody the notion of 'have', while negatives are sort of 'don't have'. They do strange things.", "rejected": "People in here are responding in terms of math, but what you're asking is just basic logic, no numbers required.  I'm not unhappy = I'm happy. Two negatives make a positive.  I am happy = I'm happy. Admittedly most people don't call a non-negative word a 'positive', but that's because positive is the default. If you state something, you are asserting that thing, not its opposite.  Why would two positives ever make anything but another positive?"}

{"prompt": "Can any MEP Engineers share some insight? I'm an EE at an MEP firm with about 2 years xp, and at this point I'm a little afraid to ask someone this question...but I am having trouble understanding the purpose of this job, at least why it requires an engineering degree?  I feel like we pretty much just place symbols on drawings, write a note that says to coordinate everything with the architect or owner, and let the contractor figure out how to actually build it. I pretty much just sit on Revit making plans without knowing much of how things are physically being constructed. Our drawings are covered with notes saying things like  \"Provide wiring and conduit for X,Y,Z, coordinate all requirements with equipment manufacturer.\" - How does this stuff actually get built? I have no idea, but sounds like its not my problem.  \"Provide a fully functioning metering system with all necessary components\" - How does this metering system work? Who knows Mr. Contractor, you figure it out.  We had a mechanical contractor ask a question to one of our engineers asking to clarify how to run some piping, the response was \"Provide fire protection plumbing as required and verify it meets all codes\" or something along those lines.  I'm pretty bored, not really using my degree at all, and quite frankly I feel like an electrician that knows how to draft would be way better at this job and way cheaper. Is this normal? I have a friend I graduated with in MEP and he feels the same way so I know I'm not alone here.", "preferred": "I doubt they would be cheaper. Journeyman electricians make like more than entry level engineers in my area rn.

{"prompt": "Advice for a young professor dealing with academic burnout and needing to revive a flagging career? I started this job four years ago and they have been really hard ones for me. Between the demands of my academic job, a difficult department/institution, and some really tough family stuff, I am just wrung out.   I am the only child of elderly parents who have had a continuous set of alternating health emergencies over the last four years. Two or even three times a year a parent required a long hospitalization and a complicated recovery that I had to take care of. A year ago my father passed away leaving the control of everything in the family to me (my mother has dementia among other chronic issues). Settling his estate and making sure my mother is cared for has been a very big job (not to mention dealing with the grief when I have a bit of time to do so, we were very close).  Superficially, my department was understanding, saying to take the time I needed and family comes first, etc. In reality (and perhaps understandably), though, they saw my reduced productivity and attendance in the department and were not pleased. I just can't be the high-performing academic they want. I kept thinking that after each crisis, things would smooth out and I really get things done, but then another would come up. I've had a few painful and frank conversations with my chair and the provost. I think they could have been more supportive, but they weren't, and it's better not to think of what could have been and concentrate on the regular situation.  I've managed to do all the service and teaching required, but that is not valued much. I tried to revive my research many times with collaborations and taking on new students. None of the students have worked out, they learned a lot but I ended up needing to redo all their work. (This could be my fault as well, not supervising them enough.)  I have a lot of great collaborations, but that work has also been massively disrupted by my family issues, and they have lost patience with me (also understandably). Just down to it, much of the issue is that I do not have the energy and focus research requires.  I need a new job, I just cannot perform at the level needed here, but I find myself feeling too burned out to go through the faculty job search process again. Also, I have not published in *years* and my last grant ran out in 2017, I have not had a new one (applied for a couple but no luck). My CV looks pretty sad right now. I should be manuscript-writing my ass off, job-applying my ass off, grant-writing my ass off, but I find I can barely get four hours of work done in a day.  (As an aside, I'm not alone in all this. I have a husband, but he actually has had almost identical issues with his family and is also exhausted and grief-stricken. Additionally, he hates his job, whereas for me it feels more like my job hates me. I have seen a therapist and a psychiatrist. I am on anti-depressants and though I am not really depressed I think it maybe helps somewhat. They have both been sympathetic and helpful in some ways, but the consensus among them is that things are just really hard and my issues are a normal response to continuous stress.)  Any advice on how to recover and revive?", "preferred": "My own problems haven't been to the same intensity, but I can relate to the feeling of constant stress and the feeling that your job hates you. Similarly my partner hated his job. I had very different circumstances and was at a very different stage of my career, but having gone through that and working outside of academia for some years have taught me that change isn't something to avoid. What stopped our torture what a career change and moving away.  Everything you described about your work situation tells me that unless you really, really, REALLY want to continue at this institution, you need to find some remaining scraps of joy, motivation, inspiration for what you loved about this job and apply elsewhere.   Your first time going through an academic job hunt was likely quite involved. Remember that you are now networked and established. Draw on your network and experience. And even honestly consider leaving academia. In the end it's just a job. I know being an academic tends to be more of a way of life / a lifestyle career, but you need a job that can flex with your life needs. With the relationships at your current institution having been damaged, you will have a mountain of expectations and prejudices to overcome. You will likely find relief in starting anew elsewhere.  Best of luck. Don't be afraid to be \"selfish\".", "rejected": "Have you thought about an institution where the tenure requirements are not as stringent? Less research more teaching."}

{"prompt": "\"Make all the figures before you start writing the paper\" is terrible advice Biomedical sciences student here. I am curious what people think of this statement. Personally, I have heard it from many PIs, including my own, leading me to believe it is a common bit of philosophy throughout academia.  Based on my experience, this has been garbage advice. Sure, you need to know your data, and you need to have it analyzed before you start writing. But I have found that the story only comes together when pen hits paper, and some parts of the story end up needing to be emphasized while others can be ignored. In the past, I tried to stick to pre-made figures and maintain the expectation that they weren't going to change. Ultimately I found that this unnecessarily constrained the story I ended up being able to tell and became a waste of time since I just remake the figures anyway.", "preferred": "Personally, by the time I am ready to actually write a manuscript, the data has been presented at conferences as either talks or posters. Meaning the figures already exist.    Most data needs to be plotted pretty soon after data collection, otherwise the next steps you take are uncertain-- at least in my field.    So the figures may not be polished, and I may get ideas for additional figures or details to add to current figures as I write, but for the most part, my figures come into being before my text does.   I also like to outline papers, and a great way to do this is to plan what figures are needed to tell that story.   Also, I pretty generally disagree with the statement:  >But I have found that the story only comes together when pen hits paper...  This sounds like a terribly inefficient way to write.  This is why you present to your research group, in your department seminars, at meetings, in graduate student groups. If you can talk through your story first, tell it verbally, you will have a much easier time writing.    Yes, the arguments in your paper become more refined and well developed as you write, but I don't see how you can even begin to write a paper with out a roadmap (at least in your head) of where you're headed.", "rejected": "If you use a reproducible approach (in R for example), it doesn't even matter because you can make quick adjustments on the fly if necessary."}

I'm reading one of my professors' ethnographies and just noticed that his photography is really good and better than others I've seen.", "preferred": "Part of photography is technical, but I think the harder thing to master is the philosophical underpinnings that separate good photographers from average/mediocre ones.  Just be careful about the ethical boundaries and how you convey your subjects. In Western photography, a propensity emerges in Western photography to highlight or focus on \"otherness\" - to exotify subjects within their context, or for photographers to superimpose their vision/interpretation of the culture onto the culture itself. I speak on this from my experience as a hobbyist photographer and as a returned Peace Corps volunteer. Engaging with cultures is not easy and how your portray your subjects fairly, in my opinion, is critical. This is not even really about international contexts - any time you're confronted with something alien, even within your own national borders, you're imposing your worldview/understanding onto your subject(s). This is easier said than done, although I think some photographers like Steve McCurry have been able to straddle the line quite well.  This is not to say that you shouldn't take pictures - just be cognizant of your own privileges as an observer and how that translates into your photography. To do it effectively means, in my opinion, to understand and participate in the culture you're observing as an equal to the extent possible... but this can affect the outcomes of your anthropological work.", "rejected": "I had photojournalism experience before I got into archaeology. I'm a bit rusty but it's come in handy when I've had to do field and artifact photography. Youtube is a wonderful resource for beginner photographers.

{"prompt": "Grant funding spent on other projects I am currently a postdoc and wanted to get others' feedback on a recent experience I had with my graduate school advisor.  While in grad school, I was part of a grant writing class. As the major assignment, we had to write a grant. I chose to apply for a small grant from a foundation that would fund and expand on my dissertation work. I wrote the grant, but my advisor submitted it.  We got the $50K grant! We used a little of the money for the project, but I was selected for a postdoc and ended up leaving. Soon after, I found out that he'd spent a lot of the money on other projects. I was upset he didn't at least tell me, but he insisted that since the grant was in his name the money was his to do what he liked with. He assured me there would be enough money to support the project, dissemination of the findings, etc.  A few months ago, I was invited to present at a conference and asked him if I could use the funding to present findings from that grant project. He said yes.   Now it's time to pay the $500 conference fees, and he tells me there's no more funding left. I  was upset and asked to meet via zoom. In the meeting, he kept telling me he didn't understand what I was talking about and that I'm \"a grown-up\" and can fund my own conferences. I kept pressing him, reminding him of what he said, and he simply hung up on me.  I tried to reach out to him via email, and no response.   I'm upset and feel like I was swindled. He clearly sees it differently. I wanted to get others' opinions on how normal and justified his behavior is. I don't have a lot of experience with grants.   Thank you!

{"prompt": "Do you think your company will relax WFH policies after covid-19 calms down? WFH seems to be a mixed bag among engineers of different disciplines.  Some people say it has vastly improved their productivity and gives them that extra time to spend with family.  Or the social isolation of WFH and home distractions has brought productivity down.  I'm more in the hardware/software overall computer engineering field.  Some FAANG level companies like Apple/Google/Amazon for engineering I've heard generally frown on WFH, and would like everyone to come into office.  I'm wondering if these companies will notice any productivity boost and while I think allowing everyone to WFH 24/7 is not feasible, it would be prudent to allow employees at minimum 2 days out the week to WFH.  It could have so many benefits.  What do you think?  In an ideal scenario in my head for software engineering, a company of 100 could lease office space for only 50 employees.  They could have flexible workstations and stagger who comes into the office on certain days.  It'd reduce traffic and give everyone more time to spend outside of commuting.

A downside I can think of is employees fighting each other over which days they would want to WFH vs. coming in.", "preferred": "I worked remotely for 1.5 years and constant WFH was one of the main reasons I've changed my job.

I think that my work-life balance was worse, because the line between worklife and private life gets pretty blurry.   That being said, I like to have WFH option to use it from time to time. It can be beneficial, but I don't believe that Covid-19 can get rid of the office jobs for good.", "rejected": "Probably not.

So after that 20 years till I'm 60 and then maybe 7 more so total of 27 years till I need to retire and hang up everything and just wait to expire. How much could I get done in that time? 27 years isn't a lot of time because you don't start the ground running you got some years of figuring things out. I'm just looking and thinking 27 years will go by fast and will I have really accomplished that much? Or will I have more than 27 years? Granted that I dont end up kicking it before then. It just feels like such a narrow time gap because a lot of it will be spent learning the ropes, won't it? I'm talking post graduation. Or is that just my own mistake?   The reason I want to go into civil engineering is I want to work where I'm not at a desk all the time, get to maybe travel to different countries and be outdoors. My friend is a civil engineer consultant and gets to do that. Im also really good at math and science as well as seeing that the world going down the gutter is like a gold mine of opportunities to fix. And I've heard that as far as civil engineering goes there is a lacking of new graduates in the states so there isna huge demand for new civil engineers as the old ones want to retire.", "preferred": "I started at 30.

Alongside that if you plan and dedicate that time to pursuing specific avenues even more is possible. That in mind you could work toward your PE, tackle bigger project and signing off on them, and additionally there\u2019s always the corporate route with an MBA and some longevity. There\u2019s also academia if you chose to follow that and \u201cpay it forward\u201d to the next generation. The complete opposite is also an option with opening your own firm and directing it from the ground up.  27 years is a long time to build a career even if you want to retire before 70. There\u2019s plenty of \u201clight\u201d duty work to be done at a high enough level if that\u2019s the route you want, or enjoy what you want while you can. Either way becoming an engineer will be as rewarding as you want it to be."}
{"prompt": "CMV: Universal basic income is the way of the future. I recently started learning more about Andrew Yang and he seems like a very kind, sensible, intelligent man. I agree with a lot of his views, one of them being universal basic income. The world is just going to get more and more automated. What do we do when people are losing their jobs to robots? With self driving cars becoming more of a reality, delivery jobs are going to be obsolete in the very near future. It\u2019s much cheaper to buy a vehicle once that can drive 24/7 than it is to pay a human being to work 8 hour shifts. With the advances in AI, many other more complicated jobs are also going to become obsolete. How do we solve the impending unemployment issue? Do we purposely hold our selves back and create issues for people to solve so they can earn their right to have their basic needs met, or do we give everybody enough money to live and let robots take over all the undesirable jobs? The experiments that have been done so far implementing universal basic income have been overwhelmingly positive, improving quality of life in the places it was tested.

Just across the board, all Landlords go \"Yep, add on another \u00a31500 a month\". Oh you wanna move out? Too bad, because every other Landlord has also done it. All of a sudden your UBI is worthless.  How do you stop that, not just for Landlords, but for EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO RECEIVES MONEY for something? Your corner shop ups its prices.

Typically, the solution presented is to tax the people who are earning, and giving it to those who aren't. In effect, further denying people the right to keep the fruit of their labor, instead giving it to those who didn't earn it.

{"prompt": "CMV: The Republican party will not become more moderate but will continue to dominate American politics In most people's opinion, the current republican party has become pretty extreme. Outlets like the National Review and the Heritage Foundation seem less influential than Fox news, Breitbart and Infowars in setting both the tone and topic of republican policies. Reagan has been succeeded by Trump and republicans have embraced white resentment rather than any kind of race neutral conservatism. Liberals are outraged every week by Trump and the Republican party, almost every one of their policies are mostly criticised by experts and both do terribly badly in polls compared to their counterparts (e.g. Trump vs previous presidents, Republicans vs Democrats), but despite all that, I can't see why republicans will suffer serious political consequences.  Trump continues to have the support of at least a third of Americans (according to most polls), Moore generally leads the polls in Alabama and republicans are still likely to retain a majority in the senate. They seem to be able to enforce a far right agenda without any real economic justification, even if it hurts their own supporters and is championed by awful people, while still being supported by at least 30-40% of people. Given that, why would republicans ever become more moderate?  Republicans have gerrymandered districts, broken political norms, changed election laws, allowed foreign interference and encouraged a far right media base that will excuse their every action. Liberals are more divided and less tribal. Independents naively dismiss both as being equally bad. I believe this will protect republicans from any permanent setback. They may lose the occasional election but they will continue to drift further right and will bring enough people with them to return to power.  So can someone please CMV that republicans will remain far right and politically successful? Will they ever have to confront the truth on climate change or care about inequality and return to being a centre right party? If not, will they ever be punished by the electorate for their extremism? _____  > *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things. Firstly, please* ***read through our rules***. *If you see a comment that has broken one, it is more effective to report it than downvote it. Speaking of which,* ***downvotes don't change views****! Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***message us***. *Happy CMVing!*", "preferred": "The fate of political parties and ideologies is all about the long-game and the big picture and from that perspective I don't think the Republicans are in such a great place.  Yes, Trump will almost certainly continue to enjoy the support of 1/3 of the country, Moore will likely win a Senate seat, and there is a good chance the Republicans will continue to have a majority in the Senate after 2018.  But keep in mind that Alabama is super Republican, the Republicans have an enormous advantage with the 2018 Senate map, and having the die hard support of 30% of the country is not such a good trade-off if it makes the other 70% hate your guts.  In the various elections since 2016, Democrats have significantly and consistently outperformed expectations.  It's easy to overlook because many of the elections still went the way they were \"supposed to\" (e.g. a Democrat winning the VA governor race was expected) but importantly, the margins significantly favored the Democrats.  VA was an unexpectedly huge blowout for Democrats and even if Moore wins in AL, there is a good chance it will be by a much thinner margin than it should have been.  All this means that when it comes to competitive races in 2018, I'd much rather be running as a Democrat than a Republican.  The problem with embracing the more extreme elements of a party is that it narrows your appeal even as it ratchets up the enthusiasm of your supporters.  Republicans are the majority party at both the national and state levels, but this is because they were able to gain support from a lot of purple and even blue leaning areas.  I think it will be tough to maintain this kind of cross-ideological appeal with people like Trump and Moore as the national faces of the party (Obama had the same result for the Democrats, and he was quite a bit more popular than Trump).  There tends to be a cyclical backlash against the ruling party no matter what they do and it's worse when they embrace the more extreme aspects of their party at the same time they're trying to maintain their \"big tent\" support.", "rejected": "The backlash will eventually happen, but hasn't happened yet. These ultra-far-right policies hurt everyone but a select minority. However, because of the slow-moving nature of our government, their effects haven't been fully felt yet. This is coupled with the fact that the Republicans have failed at many things they've tried. Many of the things that Trump has been successful at, at this point, have only been harmful to a minority of people (such as the Travel Ban).  However, the two major things I believe will make the difference are the Tax Bill and the end of Net Neutrality. Both are wildly unpopular to the point that if someone is aware of them, they typically disapprove. Still, Republicans are pushing forward with both, and politically own the consequences of both. Unlike Trump's earlier successes, these are moves that hurt everyone. The current Tax Bill doesn't function on basic levels, and removing net neutrality is bad for so many reasons that I can't even get into it.  The point is that the repercussions will soon be felt by the average American. When that happens, there will be a shift."}
{"prompt": "How often do you do calculations by hand?  Hi r/AskEngineers I'm a freshman mechanical engineering student. To me there is something sort of romantic and elegant about doing calculations by hand. I know that a lot of analysis and computation has to be done through an application or is programmed, but how often do you as a working engineer find yourself doing calculations by hand? What topics does it involve, are they techniques you covered in school? Which classes or domains does it usually relate to, algebra, calculus, physics, design? If you find yourself doing it, what part of the design process does it factor in to? Are you mostly using it to check your work, think through things loosely, or rule out possibilities? Is it more involved than occasional mental arithmetic?", "preferred": "It depends on your role, but it definitely comes up.  When I was an analyst, I set up lots of spreadsheets for structural and dynamics calcs, that\u2019s what we usually considered \u201chand calcs\u201d.  It\u2019s almost always closed form equations - I have never solved a calculus problem by hand - once, I had matlab solve a bunch of acceleration calculus equations, and more often if I had a time-domain physics problem (like two vehicles with rubber bumpers colliding), I set up a 500 line spreadsheet to do time slices amd solved the kinematic equations at each step, it was way easier to set up, check, and share with others, and it made nice graphs.  When I worked in maintenance engineering at a theme park, being conversational in basic calcs is key, but doing formal calcs was less common unless you were doing a strength check.  F=ma, beam problems, that sort of thing.  Like, something specific that came up a lot is, if you have a bracket or plate or whatever that is bending too much, how do you fix it?  Double a plate\u2019s thickness and you get 2^3=8 times higher mass moment of inertia / 8X less deflection.  Change from aluminum to steel you get 3X higher young\u2019s modulus / 3X less deflection, but it will be 3X heavier.  Stuff like that.  Or, if you beed to accelerate something at 1G, how much force does it take?  However much it weighs", "rejected": "Every day.   For all the standard repeated calculations that I do for everything, I have spreadsheets and scripts that can do all that automatically.

{"prompt": "The minimum wage should be removed and replaced by unemployment benefits. My gut says there something wrong with this so by all means, CMV. This was a thought that came to me rather randomly in result to some recent posts on the true cost of Walmart. Essentially the fact that due to low wages we are subsidizing Walmarts. Note this is specifically aimed at the USA since I live there. It probably applies to other countries as well.  The often trumpeted \"solution\" to this problem is a higher minimum wage. Something like double the current. The problem is that raising the minimum wage doesn't actually change the market pressures. If the market wage is below the minimum wage less people will be hired. To change the market wage either the supply or the demand would have to change. A minimum wage does neither.  Unemployment benefits on the other hand would lower the supply. People would now have a better option. A business couldn't have incredibly low wages because people would just stay with the unemployment benefits.  The fact that these are unemployment benefits vs just a check everyone gets is critical. The latter is close to our current system. People below a certain threshold, the poverty level, get benefits to help them survive. This is much better than the alternative, but it leads to things like the Walmart where much of the profit is in fact coming out of the taxpayers pockets.  Just to get this out of the way here's some common objections I've received and my response:  *  **Wouldn't this lead to freeloaders?**     Yes, that's the entire point, but it could be minimized by keeping the benefits fairly low. Enough to keep yourself above water, but not fun.  * **Isn't the government big enough already?**    That's why I'm interested in what I might be missing here. My gut agrees with this, but I can't come up with why.  * **Scams/implementation?**    This is probably the biggest problem I can come up with. What to do about the almost 50% of Americans who aren't officially employed? That would probably have to be something like benefits=unemployment benefits-income.   As I've already mentioned my gut say's I'm wrong, so Reddit what'd I miss.", "preferred": "I kind of agree with your scheme, but the problem is that it creates perverse incentives. If you give people a decent amount of money when they are unemployed *and take it away once they get a job*, people will often lose money by taking a job. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that jobs have additional costs over being unemployed (e.g. transport costs to and from your job). If someone is going from not working at all to working 40 hours a week, they're going to want the business to pay a lot of money more than the unemployment benefits and transport costs if they're going to take the job. Companies may not be willing to pay this (if hiring new people would cause them to lose money), so instead they'll just not hire people, and now we have a lot of people who either can't or won't get a job. This is a recipe for recession.  The solution would be to not take the benefits away when people get a job. This would be a form of basic income guarantee. This scheme would pay the benefits to everyone, so everyone has what they need to live. However, now companies don't have to cover the entire cost of the benefits + transport costs + compensation for people's time, as the basic income would pay some of it, so they'll be much more willing to hire people and the economy is likely to perform better. This would allow us to eliminate the minimum wage if we want, like your scheme, and let people decide what wage they want to take freely, as their basic needs would be covered.", "rejected": "why are you calling it unemployment benefits?  there's already something called that and is paid for by taxes paid while you were working.

{"prompt": "Here are the results from running a dehumidifier at low vs high speed (continuation of previous post) Previous post was here - https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/zjhw7t/do\\_dehumidifiers\\_actually\\_dry\\_the\\_air\\_faster\\_on/  **Full results** \\- https://prnt.sc/uCqkeO8pTM9\\_  **Summary** \\- on low speed it collected 191g of condensate per hour. On high speed it collected 204g of condensate per hour. So high speed is faster, but only by 6%. This might be due to small differences in room humidity during the test.  Meanwhile, power consumption was 184W on high speed and 179W on low speed, so 2% more consumption in high.  Bit more background info -  **Experimental set up**: The hardest part of this test is ensuring consistent environmental conditions, since running the dehumidifier at different settings will affect the environment and hence the condensation rate in a self-feeding cycle. So the dehumidifier was placed in one of the largest spaces in the building (much larger than it was designed for) and left to stabilize for a day before the tank was emptied and measurements started.  The water tank was removed for weighing for each test, so at the start of each test the dehumidifier was running for 5 minutes without the compressor (since removing the tank makes it shut down and there\u2019s a compressor restart time delay).  **Environment**: building made of hollow concrete blocks and limestone. All windows closed. Nominally 60%RH and 23\u00b0C.  **Equipment**: Dehumidifier rated for 11 litres per day at 80%RH, 32\u00b0C  **Disclaimer**: These results are only valid for me using my dehumidifier in my house.

He said he really did not care what degree you had so much as what have you done lately and who vouches for you.    From his perspective only at the very top of r&d and in certain government-facing roles did anyone really care what your degree was.  He was paying kids with technology degrees 80k plus right out of college way back in the 2000s.  As an aside he did mention that the people who were most concerned with the differences between the degrees were electrical engineers (not \"technologists\") who were poor performers.

And on that note many times people say that producing beef or almonds or other things waste tons of water, but isnt that water also recycled eventually?", "preferred": "If the rate at which we consume water exceeds the rate at which water is recycled, a shortage becomes inevitable.  It's like spending more money than you make.  You'll eventually go broke, no matter how big your savings.  This can happen at any scale.", "rejected": "There\u2019s a shortage of Fresh Water.  Fresh water is effectively evaporated salt water (salt stays behind) which moves over land as clouds, and rains, snows, etc.  It collects in reservoirs, or as snow/ice which eventually melts, but bottom line, it\u2019s free fresh water.

{"prompt": "Why do all celestial bodies have some degree of spin/rotation to them? As far as i understand everything in the universe is spinning. Why isnt anything rotationless? Does the universe itself have some kind of spin to it as far as we can tell?", "preferred": "The short answer is because there are many ways to rotate, but only one way to not rotate.  When gravity pulls particles together, they are initially moving in random directions.  If a particle being drawn in is moving directly toward the center of the particles, we say it has zero angular momentum.  If it's not moving directly toward the center, it has some non-zero angular momentum.  Angular momentum can be both positive and negative, depending on direction.  The rotation of the body that's eventually formed from the particles has a rotation that's determined by the total angular momentum of all the particles that formed it.  The only way that the body can come together with no rotation is if the total angular momentum of the particles cancels out and equals zero.  This is possible, but very unlikely.  So almost everything rotates.", "rejected": "It comes from the spin of the initial nebular disc.  Which got it's spin from a nearby supernova.  Planets formed in the outer part of the disc.  The plane of the ecliptic is one piece of evidence.  All 8 planets revolve and rotate in roughly the same direction.  There are outliers, which are assumed to have experienced impacts.

{"prompt": "CMV: Shooting police in retaliation to brutality is justified by the 2nd Amendment I am not a supporter of gun ownership. Frankly, (and I know I'm not alone on this) I find the idea absurd. However, according to the 2^nd Amendment, \"A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed\".   Given that police are employees of the state, and their brutality restricts the freedom of citizens, BAME people in particular, the 2^nd Amendment can be used as justification for rioters in the US to shoot police during confrontations.   I don't think the 2^nd amendment should be in place, it's crazy that there is any sort of justification for murder, but, as it is, logic suggests that, constitutionally, there is nothing wrong with anyone shooting police.", "preferred": "You're basically creating an interpretation of the 2nd amendment, and then using that crazy interpretation to justify why the 2nd amendment is \"absurd.\"  The 2nd amendment merely protects your ability to own a gun, it does not specify what amount of violence you can perform with said gun. The 2nd amendment was intended to make sure that physical-power was not entirely consolidated to the federal government. They did not condone the overthrowing of the U.S government, much of the constitution was actually written off the back of a failed insurrection (Shay's rebellion). The 2nd amendment was there to allow states the potential to overthrow the government if it ever became absolutely necessary to do so, but that was NEVER going to be legally condoned. The 2A is about giving the potential, not the right.", "rejected": "The biggest issue with this line of reasoning is that the individual gets to decide what is tyranny before using lethal force against a government employee.

{"prompt": "is a black hole necessarily a singularity (and vice versa) My superficial knowledge of what black holes are and how they work tell me the answer to the question is yes (yes), but I'm not sure.  I guess I understand that if you have a black hole, the mass must be in a singularity since, if you have gravity strong enough to bend space entirely inwards so that light can't escape, then surely there are no other forces that can resist this by pushing apart (like how atoms or neutrons push each other away) to constitute a body of some sort.  So it seems that a black hole necessarily contains a singularity?  Ok, then, if you have a situation where gravity is strong enough to create a singularity, is it necessarily also a black hole? Can you have a singularity so small that light can't fall into it, or something like that?  I'm sort of thinking of this case where you have a neutron star, and you add one neutron at a time... is there going to be a point where I add a neutron and \"pop\" it's a singularity / black hole, or is there some in-between (however narrow) where you're not quite one or the other?", "preferred": "Short answer, we don't know.  The math predicts singularity, but usually that's just a big red flag that you've reached the limitations of the math, not necessarily the limitations of the real physical universe. There may be some as yet unknown physics that prevents a singularity. Some believe that a further level of collapse is possible beyond a neutron star to an unknown star type that we haven't seen yet - quark stars are the common term. Just because the curvature of spacetime around an object is extreme enough to create an event horizon, it doesn't necessarilly follow that there has to be a singularity at the center.", "rejected": "So, from my understanding, the math simply isn\u2019t there to confirm or deny that there is *actually* a *physical* singularity in a black hole. I\u2019ve heard it said that a singularity is simply a situation in which a given system is attempting to describe a particular event or situation it wasn\u2019t really designed to. For example, there\u2019s a singularity at the north and south poles: the zero dimensional points at which all longitudes converge and it becomes impossible to meaningfully differentiate them. Where every direction is south/north (depending on which pole you\u2019re at). I\u2019m sure I\u2019m explaining this poorly. Maybe someone else can come in and clean up my mess.  In any case, until and unless we get a functioning theory of quantum gravity, we won\u2019t really know *what* happens inside a black hole, much less at the singularity."}

No self respecting WNY'er breads chicken wings.  Drop raw wings in 350 degree oil for 15 minutes. This is key. After 15 minutes, the wings get sauced in a hot saute pan. Melt your butter, toss the wings around in the butter, and then coat each wing with Franks. This makes your standard Buffalo medium wing.

People who are immunocompromised for some reason I.E Chemo or a genetic disorder cannot be vaccinated so they rely on the fact that everyone else is vaccinated to be protected. Children under 12 months of age have not had the MMR vaccine also rely on herd immunity to protect them  Let's say an unvaccinated person comes into contact with that pathogen. they have only the basic primary immune response to the disease and will suffer all the negative consequences which may be life threatening and cause permanent damage before their body can fight off the infection. in the meantime, the pathogen has replicated many many times and produced and some of those will have varied genetically. some of these genetic variations may change the antigens on the surface of the pathogen (the proteins that your immune system uses to recognise them as pathogens)  This person then comes into contact with many other people during their miserable day because the antigens on the surface of the pathogen have changed; vaccinated individuals do not have an immune system that can recognise the new strain of pathogen and so they are not protected and have just had their week ruined.

{"prompt": "AITA for imprisoning a man until he agreed to marry me? Recently, while entertaining friends, it was revealed that my courtship with my husband was less than orthodox. My friends now think that I'm an asshole for the way that I wooed him.  When I was sixteen, my first husband (Adam) was killed while on Crusade. This news was relayed to me by one of Adam's comrades-at-arms (Robert, 29M) who arrived in Carrick bearing Adam's heart for burial in the family chapel. Although I had been fond of Adam (he was the father of my eldest daughter, after all), and was grieved at the news of his death, I was immediately struck by Robert's appearance and manners. I was, in fact, infatuated: not only was Robert handsome and charming, but as a cousin of the king, he was well-positioned at court and within the realm.  I extended Robert an invitation to stay with me for several days so that he could rest after his journey from the Holy Land and he accepted my hospitality. As I really wanted him to stay with me forever, I instructed my household guard to ensure that Robert was confined to the boundaries of my estate. He was given freedom of the castle and its grounds, though, and I made every effort to be a charming, gracious, and attractive hostess.  After several weeks of chaste companionship, I worked up the courage to propose marriage; either Robert could marry me and become lord of my estate, or, he could remain as my guest indefinitely. He chose to marry me and our first daughter was born nine months after the wedding. In the last fifteen years, we have had eleven children and have enjoyed a largely happy union.  Still, our marriage did cause Robert's cousin, King Alexander III, some consternation. As countess of Carrick in my own right, I was considered an heiress of some importance within the kingdom, a ward of the crown's, and technically, I needed the king's approval to marry again. Yet, as I had married his own cousin, Alexander III could not really object to the match; that said, he fined us heavily before agreeing to allow my new husband the use of my title. By virtue of our marriage, Robert has therefore become the earl of Carrick in addition to the lord of Annandale. He is the administrator of my estate in Carrick, and of my fortune. I am happily the wife of a man that I chose and the mother of many beloved children.   All's well that ends well, right?

Probably ~30 years old or so, and it's right in the corner of the fence line.  About 20 years ago (as far as I can tell from records) my neighbor built an additional home right up against that property line. Now he's split his property and is trying to sell that house, but surprise surprise, potential buyers don't like the look of massive redwood roots encroaching on the foundation.  Even though I've been the owner of this home for less than 6 months, suddenly I need to jump into action to deal fix this in order to make it easier for him to sell his home. He talked to me about it less than a week ago, but now is following up with more pointed texts.  I know CA law has some standards of maintenance to deal with dangerous trees or avert property damage, but it isn't currently doing any damage, and if he wants permission to get someone to do it himself I would absolutely be happy to give that to him, but he seems really invested in this idea that the sole responsibility is on me.

And also (3) whether the tree is healthy and poses a hazard to structures on anyone's property.    If you ARE okay with negotiating to having the tree taken down or destroyed, you should next check your local laws and see if that's something YOU are allowed to agree to.  Some places restrict you from damaging or destroying redwoods, such as San Mateo.  If you're allowed to agree to this (or you can get permission), then you can negotiate a deal with your neighbor; it's reasonable for you to expect to *receive* money here rather than pay money, since the tree is valuable and you don't have any reason to want it to be taken down and in fact prefer it the way it is.", "rejected": "California Civil Code Section 833  https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2011/civ/division-2/829-834/833/  Trees whose trunks stand wholly upon the land of one owner belong exclusively to him, although their roots grow into the land of another.  https://legalbeagle.com/7454514-tree-maintenance-law-california.html    In the 1994 case of Booska v.

Many vegetables, including cabbage, also contain high concentrations of TMAO which in the presence of a catalyst (such as the enzymes from your salmon) and heat (cooking) will convert into TMA and produce a mind-boggling fishy smell.

{"prompt": "CMV: I cannot understand how a modern developed nation can require skirts with bare legs as part of a school uniform, and only for some students I'm mostly talking about the U.K. and Japan of which I know it is done there, but I'm sure there are other cases.  I grew up in the Netherlands, where there were no school uniforms, and certainly no bare legs. Almost everyone wore trousers. The idea of not only requiring this, but onnly requiring it for half the students based on their sex seems outright barbaric to me:  - It is cold - To me, it appears as needless sexualization of often very young students to require them to expose this much of their skin - It is impractical as the skirts generally lack pockets  I cannot understand how this can occur in a modern nation; perhaps in a country without unisex suffrage. Such a thing would only happen in very religious towns in the Netherlands where the opinion is indeed in against unisex suffrage. Outside of it, if a school were to require such a thing, both student and parent alike would not have it, and the courts would surely shut it down immediately as both cruel and sexist.  Of course, similar arguments can be raised against the practice of requiring very short trousers, which are less common. \u2014 I do not understand how the adults in charge with a straight face can tell the children they are required to expose their legs for no good reason when full length trousers exist.", "preferred": "Why on earth in the 21st century do we still consider showing bare skin on the lower half of our legs sexualization...  I come from a very hot and humid country where most of us wear school uniforms from childhood all the way until our teenage years and I can tell you the purpose of the uniforms are definitely not for sexualization. Altering the school uniform in certain ways such as making the skirts too short, or making the trousers more tight fitting are both not allowed by most school regulations. The administration does not want to sexualize uniforms. If someone looks at a student in uniform and sexualizes them then the fault lies with the individual and not the clothes.  If you say that skirts = bare legs = sexualization, there are a few questions I think are worth considering. If schools were to require all the skirts to be ankle length would you be ok with that? In many schools, especially at the elementary level, boys wear knee length trousers and also show some bare skin. Would that also be sexualization? What about if all students were to wear tight pants or leggings but show no bare skin?  It's fair to say that requiring skirts for girls and trousers for boys is enforcing gender norms on the student population and a choice should be presented, but in a lot of cases the reason those rules still exist is simply that there aren't enough requests from the students and/or parents to change them. Skirts can be comfortable, non-sexual, and have pockets(imagine that!). So it's not like majority of female students feel oppressed having to wear them. The term barbaric is rather extreme.  If we're talking about JP, some schools have already started giving students the choice to wear either trousers or skirts as they please. Schools also do not encourage super short skirts. It's the students themselves who will alter/roll up their skirts to make them shorter. It's not always cold. Japanese summers are hot and humid, pretty much comparable with the tropics. As for the absolute territory, the S and A tier ones are those that show the least amount of bare skin so idk man.", "rejected": "Remembering back to my (what qualifies as high school here) high school days (without uniforms), the girls would definitely choose to wear very short skirts or pants in the summer... And long skirts or warm trousers/ jeans in the winter. As well as on carnival, during which there'd sometimes still be freezing temperatures. At least past a certain age. I think we don't need to pretend that most teenagers aren't horny and don't have a desire to feel sexually attractive to their peers - it's human nature. (Obviously, a 15 year old girl who wants to look attractive doesn't want to be stared at by some old fuck, but that's a different point entirely.)   Certainly, there's an argument to be made that *requiring* it is somewhat weird, but in most cases that I'm aware of, bare legs are not a requirement, even if skirts are, so these... Thin opaque pants, whatever they're called in English, can be worn in addition to the skirt (this is also true for Japan, as far as I'm aware)."}

Compared to a bigger/heavier rig that\u2019s going to give you 24 hrs of battery life that you just don\u2019t need.  Phones are also kind of the same principle. A decent number of people have office jobs. Whack your usb charging cable in your bag and you can charge off the work computer if needed.

{"prompt": "Leaving a large corporation to work at a small company? Hi Reddit,  I don't post much at all, but thought I would seek out the advice from my favorite online community.  I am almost 4 years out of school with a BSME and work for a huge corporation doing a job I do not like.  I feel like the role I currently am in (Quality Engineer in an office environment) does not offer me the opportunity to gain new transferable skills, making it difficult to work towards the job I really want (manufacturing environment, either manufacturing engineer or quality engineer).  I have recently been offered a role at a very small company (< 30 people) for a position I think I would really enjoy.  I would be responsible for Quality and most production operations, and I think I would love the projects and daily work.  The product line is niche, but it would offer manufacturing experience which I am looking for.  The pay would be slightly better at the new job, but I feel like I would be losing all of the connections/mentors I have gained at the huge corporation.  These are people who have climbed the corporate ladder with the same company for years, and I am not sure they would want to keep in touch if I left the company due to my disloyalty. Also, i am interested in eventually attending grad school and the new company does not explicitly offer tuition reimbursement, so graduate school opportunities may not be on the table.  If I go to a small company, will I ever be able to return to work for a large company again?  Is it worth it to find personal satisfaction doing a job you love (small company) vs working a job you hate, but may offer better future opportunities (corporation)?

{"prompt": "Thanksgiving menu for LARGE group. What ingredients can be/are best prepped in advance? So for the past 4 years my wife and I, because of our combined culinary prowess, get tapped by our coworkers to cook the Thanksgiving meal (holidays off are rare). We've both worked at the same job for years but on different teams. My current team is significantly smaller (3 guys) versus hers (50-60) so I'll be prepping and cooking for her team again this year. There are some support staff that will be there as well, so I'm essentially cooking for 75+ people. I have access to a \"commercial style\" kitchen, but I do most of the prep in the 3 days leading up to Thanksgiving day. Only problem is I average about 2 hours of sleep per night when cooking for these events, then cooking for 6-8 hours the day of. I don't think my body could take it this year since I'm on blood pressure meds and can't chug energy drinks and espresso like I used to. I'm going to be prepping, cooking, and freezing whatever I can in advance (already starting the soup cause I already know it freezes well). This is the menu I've created for this year's festivities  &#x200B;  This is my menu for my Facility's Thanksgiving Dinner (edited/redacted for doxx purposes)  &#x200B;  So my question is what Veg and other items, based on this menu, do you think could be prepped safely 2-3 weeks in advance? Does stale cornbread freeze/thaw well? How long will rough chopped bell peppers keep before losing their fresh crunch? Shallots?  &#x200B;  I make the prime rib sous-vide (Pan sear, then sous vide @ 133 degrees for 8 hours, then charcoal grill finish). Could this be Seared, sous vide, then frozen/refrigerated after quick chilling in an ice bath?  &#x200B;  Does red wine jus/demi freeze well?  &#x200B;  Any expertise on this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you", "preferred": "Not much advice here, just encouragement.    After reading your menu and some of the comments, I understand. My mother cooks exactly like this. She makes exceptionally gourmet food out of her home kitchen. She slowly upgraded some kitchen appliances so they are somewhat commercial grade. She makes incredible meals for 30-40 people at least once a year, 10-15 people about once every 6 months, and 4-5 people once per month. Everything down to her sauces, breads, basics are always fresh from scratch. If I can take time off work, she calls me a few days in advance to fly into town and help her cook the larger meals. We are home cooks, but have learned how to prep large meals over the years. My mom runs the show and I'm her right hand.    For the larger crowds (usually Thanksgiving or the company's annual get-together):   About a week in advance, my mom finalizes the menu and gets all the groceries. She writes out a detailed timeline for prepping and cooking. This timeline details all the tasks leading up to the first guest entering the house: when to start the steam table, when to mix the punch, pop the champagne, pour the ice, etc. Any idle family members or idle hands will get tasked to help with the last minute finishing touches.    Starting 3-4 days in advance, I design the menus and write mouth-watering descriptions for the courses.  I like to match the background of the menu to her tablecloth and the colors that match the event, buy matching flowers, buff silverware, decorate in the theme color (trust me, every event has a theme color), set up the seating diagram, etc. I make printed menus for each plate, tent-folded labels (matching fonts and design) for each dish and drink, and run thru the guest list to check for allergies/kids/seating accommodations. I even look thru the menu's dishes to make sure there is a variety of colors, fruits, and vegetables so that the food will look appetizing.  Two days in advance is when we make the desserts, sauces, flavored butters, whipped cream, caramelized onions, breads, etc, that can get refrigerated (we have 5+ fridges each for different types of foods). These can get taken out the morning of the event or popped in an oven if necessary to warm up.   A day before is when most of the prep and cooking happens. The soups are made and refrigerated, the sous vide starts, the greens get blanched and refrigerated, all the chopping of fresh fruits and vegetables is done (labeled, then refrigerated). Any delicate desserts are prepped (pavlova tiers get baked, sponge cakes brushed with syrup, homemade ice cream is made and frozen).   I think the biggest help is having space to keep things organized and having a competent 'sous' chef or many helping hands to help keep the items cooking so you can focus on the timing of everything.   I saw a lot of comments that disparaged your way of cooking, that people don't care, that your effort is useless, and that you should cater. Family members tell my mom the exact same thing, yet everyone (metaphorically) licks their plates clean, talks about how gourmet and fresh everything tastes, and word spreads about my mother's cooking in our community. She prides herself on quality and almost never caters meals from restaurants because she enjoys making food from scratch. The people that attend our dinner parties range from business execs, docs, lawyers, to country/redneck folks to extra starving college students that somehow show up at Thanksgiving with family members.   It's a lot of prep and work, but this is how my mom shows her love and I see myself starting to organize and prep small dinner parties in her style of cooking.   Best of luck. Your menu looks incredible and with a good timeline, this will come together very well.", "rejected": "None of these really scream \"prep ahead\" to me other than perhaps pre-cutting potatoes to soak overnight or parboiling macaroni and having it ready to bake.

I'm an engineer here in the US, and my wife, also from Khartoum, is an accountant, so I have at least some reference point on where you're coming from, culturally, to bring you to some of your conclusions.  Now, I don't know if I'm going to get this post erased because you're *partially* correct.  Your main premise is that you don't need to go to a traditional four year college in order to get a good job or good career is partially true.  However, it's becoming increasingly difficult to be able to make a long term liveable wage without at least some kind of specialized training that you get in a post-highschool setting.  Whether this means going to community college to get an associates degree in something, or going to an actual trade school to become something like a welder, or plumber, continuing your education after high school is *very* important.  If you intend on staying in the US (my wife still want's to go back to Khartoum sometimes), it's going to be very difficult to be employed without some kind of \"marketable\" skills.  Now, again, you're partially correct in thinking that people are \"brainwashed\" into the cultural need for a \"traditional\" college education.  There is, realistically, an overt driving force in the middle class of the US that it's paramount you go to a normal 4 year college for your Bachelors degree, which may be a little excessive.  BUT  The base of this is the drive is the understanding that you'll be able to work longer, and make a lot more money throughout your life if you go to college.  I didn't finish my degree until I was in my late 20's, so I had to spend about a decade of my life working jobs where your qualifications were \"high school diploma\"  Now, the jobs I had weren't *terrible*, but they were *very* difficult, lots of manual labor, very little thought put into my daily activities, just show up and muscle your way through the day.  You can make decent money if you're willing to work hard, but you're going to need to just about kill yourself to do it.  It takes *years* of back breaking labor to make it in this world using your muscles.  But as soon as I finished my degree, my salary doubled and I wasn't nearly as dead at the end of the day.  My wife and I have time to be with our friends, we have time to travel (we're hoping to go to Khartoum in June for her brothers wedding) life is a lot easier after the degree.  So, to sum it all up:  TL:DR : It's not impossible to make it in the US without a degree.  But your options are much more limited and it's much less likely that you'll be able to live as comfortably without a degree as you would with one.  Having a degree takes a lot of stress out of your life, both mentally and physically.

We are a home based vendor so it has to be under certain food laws (basically not having to be refrigerated is the simplest understanding of it). Right now the idea is to make different pie crusts with the leftover cookies and butter. Then selling either the crusts or maybe some cookie/brownies baked on top. Any other ideas?

{"prompt": "People who were grad students during the 2008 financial crisis, how badly did it affect you? I will be starting a PhD soon, so I just thought knowing an answer to this might be helpful should there be another recession coming. I believe academia might have been affected differently from the rest of the workforce.", "preferred": "I was in my 2nd year of grad school, so somewhat insulated *personally* but the doom and gloom outlook really ramped up afterwards.   During my 3rd year (2009) was when it really hit the universities hard and I was TAing so seeing first hand the struggle of the undergrads in a city where it was very difficult to support themselves - small college town with limited employment opportunities (only so many server positions in restaurants and *thousands* of students competing for those part-time jobs), high rent due to a very low vacancy rate and isolation from other towns with affordable rent, expensive tuition that was getting jacked up 33% or more at the last minute, students unable to get loans/money, etc.   I was at the infamous pepper spray school, for reference on what I observed, and I was a TA at the time of that incident. There were tons of protests on the campus, and they would often disrupt the classes I was a TA for by pulling fire alarms because \"There aren't enough people protesting outside now! You should be protesting, not be in class!\" There was a deep schism between liberal arts and STEM majors. The former wanted protests during the day and felt classes and tests, etc should come to a stand-still. The latter wanted to attend the classes they were paying for and wanted to protest in the evenings and between classes. They occupied the admin building. They shut down the freeway for a time. Also, the university got a \"sponsorship\" from a bank which resulted in them re-issuing new ID cards to everyone that could double as ATM cards if you signed up for an account with that bank, and resulted in that bank branch opening *on campus*. It was extremely distasteful and sparked more protests and occupation.   Also, around that time due to the increasing costs of tuition, a lot of students were dropping out, suspending studies, or double/tripling up on housing. The housing situation was always a bit crazy - renting out curtained off living room areas and stair landings, 3-4 bedroom homes with 6-8 people in them that resembled dorms (bunk beds, multiple desks, etc.) but it got truly *insane* when the recession hit. The vacancy rate skyrocketed and rents actually *decreased* for a time, with financial incentives offered for renewals (get your deposit back if you re-sign by [date]! get a month free!\" etc.) The living situation was compounded by the fact that the town is a little isolated and transit to other towns nearby limited to non-existant. You could live in the neighboring town, but then you would *need* a car and a parking pass. Same with the city. And rents in the surrounding areas were very, very reasonable and affordable, but then how do you get to university and the resources you need to study and do well?   In grad school I noticed that after the recession hit we had far more of the \"idk what I'm doing, grad school is a safe bet I guess, students\". People who got out of undergrad, were facing poor employment prospects, and had the grades for grad school and thought an extra degree might help, or just \"needed some time\" to figure their shit out. Much higher proportions of the 2009, 2010, and 2011 classes mastered out in 2-3 years after starting than the 2006, 2007, and 2008 cohorts and earlier cohorts. And even the later ones didn't seem to have the same attrition. It was kind of a safety net for people who needed some \"extra time\" or an \"extra degree\" to launch. I have no judgment on people who did this - you gotta do what you gotta do to keep afloat and people change their minds on grad school all the time. They're all great people who went on to do things that made them happy in life.   Interestingly, the housing market in the university town was mostly insulated. We looked into buying thinking it might be a great investment time, but the prices were at pre-recession levels because the demand in a town with a large UC was still so high.", "rejected": "I was a poor graduate student instead of a poor working person, I suppose."}
{"prompt": "HVAC Company Owner texted me that my system was unprofessionally installed and he\u2019s worried for me. I got my bank to give me back half. Now he is suing me personally, not his company. I want to countersue. What can I do? [Ohio] This could go on for forever but long story short, I hired ABC company in October to put in a new HVAC system. After 6 weeks they still didn\u2019t finish it and still expected payment.   I refused to pay the remaining $750. Then I had my credit card give me back $4,000 that he charged me. He was left with $4,500.  I got a quote from 2 HVAC companies that it was done super poorly and needs to be fully replaced. Oversized system, undersized ducts, no dampers, only 1 return, unsupported duct arms, only 1 supply for 1,000 square foot finished basement, etc.  He is now suing me for $5,250 under his own personal name in small claims court. Here\u2019s a few things wrong:  1. If he were to win, I would only owe $4,750 so he\u2019s suing for too much.  2. The plaintiff in this case is named as John Doe (Owners name) and not ABC Company. I don\u2019t have a contract with John Doe, I have one with ABC Company.  3. I want to file a counterclaim against ABC Company for the remainder of the money but they\u2019re not the ones suing me.  4. In Ohio, an officer of the company can represent that company without a lawyer but they can\u2019t advocate like a typical person.  It seems like he\u2019s making mistakes all over the place. Also he sent me the following text:  https://imgur.com/a/lZWmg4y   Who do I file the counterclaim against? Should I get a lawyer? I already spent hours making a timeline, summary of damages, pictures of everything, like him driving on my lawn and cutting electrical wires and leaving all of his trash, ducts falling down, quotes from other HVAC companies, etc. I feel like with that text message I have a slam dunk case but I don\u2019t know the intricacies of all of this.

{"prompt": "How important is your first job out of college as an engineer? I've been thinking about this for a while. I'm entering my third year of my engineering program and I'm becoming more and more aware of how competitive the job market is. My dream job would be to do spacecraft simulations (thermal, CFD, structural, etc.) but I realize the chances of me getting a job like that right out of college are practically zero. Looking from an employer's point of view, I wouldn't want to hire someone with no experience with just a B.S. to do this kind of work when there are hundreds of engineers with a Master's with 10+ years of experience applying for the same position.  I have a friend who just graduated from college who is really adamant on doing design and analysis work in the aerospace industry. He has internship experience and was the aero lead for our supermileage club where he designed the aerodynamic shell. The problem is not getting job interviews for him, the problem is that what he is being offered isn't what he wants to do. For instance, he interviewed at a 3D printing company today where he was offered a customer interfacing job (which had no design or analysis work). Would you have taken this job in his situation? I'm of the opinion that you shouldn't take a job for the sake of taking a job. On the other hand, even though his job wouldn't have included design or analysis, is the opportunity for him to do that at that company completely closed? There's always networking opportunities for companies like that as well, right?  I feel that your first job out of college is pretty important. If you want to end up doing CFD for SpaceX, but you take a manufacturing engineering job where you make drawings for parts on SolidWorks, isn't the door almost completely closed for you to do that? My idea is, if you aren't constantly doing CFD work, how can you improve? Yes, you have experience, but it isn't practical. Would you really be that much more useful than a engineer with a B.S. that did CFD work for clubs? Could you potentially be less useful?  If you work at a startup like Boom, or a smaller company, you would have the opportunity to do a lot of different things, which would improve your engineering skills. On the contrary, even if you work at a bigger company like Northrop, but you're making calls to customers and doing paperwork, you would still be in the environment that you want to be in, so you could potentially watch the CFD dudes and learn from them, right? So as long as your first job is in the industry that you want to end up in, you should be set?  But what if you can't find something like that? Are you going to be screwed? How long should you wait after you graduate to find a suitable job? How related was your first job out of college to what you're doing currently? Please share your opinion, I would like a lot of comments about this.

I did CFD and thermal analysis for six solid years and I had to downplay that to get a job in prototyping for a company that makes radar systems. When my previous employer, a Fortune 500 company was chopping heads off to ship CFD/FEA jobs overseas, I wanted to get in on an entry position to biomed but the heads of R&D didn't want an aeronautics master's degree on a position when it came to shareholders meeting  Bottom line is this: your background is likely to fuck you over just as it can boost you.

I would be hesitant to spend a long time without work looking for the perfect job opportunity. I wasn't the best academically but I worked my ass of every summer and did 3 internships so I already had 7 months work experience and great references when it came time to look for jobs.  At the time I had similar concerns about going into a project role and not using or building on the hard engineering skills I had from my degree. I took a pay cut and moved across the country after 18 months in project to take up a technical role. For a while it was my dream job but after a while it became like groundhog day, all the fun was in building the models and automating the modelling process and then it was just endless tweaks and updates on the same things. I went back into projects to fill the rest of time. I am now in a completely different industry and role in another country and loving it.

{"prompt": "CMV: Legacy admissions to colleges and any other preferential treatment due to being associated with someone famous or someone that works their is unfair I mean this is not a rant.  I feel that legacy admissions are a bit unfair sometimes. Since oftentimes (if not always) the legacy admissions policy gives preferential treatment to the poor 2.0 student that didn't give a shit in high school over a straight A high school valedictorian all because the 2.0 student is a son of a alumni to the institution and the A student isn't. This is especially unfair when the admissions to the college is very competitive.  It's said that 69% of students agree that legacy admissions is not fair, and 58% of legacy students say that legacy admissions are unfair.  I mean I don't see how being the song or daughter of a alumnus makes your more deserving of admittance to top institutions.  Also, some people have a higher chance to get admitted all because they have a relative or friend that works at the university. This is also not fair since it's anti-meritocratic in a situation that's supposed to be meritocratic.", "preferred": "Hypothetically, legacy admissions may be a benefit to the other students attending that school, not just to the legacy students themselves. Primarily, these benefits are in terms of donations to the school which benefit all students, as well as networking opportunities that the other students otherwise would not get.   As others have pointed out, schools' only goal shouldn't be fairness, it should be to do the most good for the most students possible. If admitting some slightly less qualified, but rich or otherwise influential students accomplishes that goal, then they should keep doing it.", "rejected": "It isn't fair. But why does it need to be?    Legacy admissions make sense, because of giving rates and endowments, and connections.  The most elite schools can afford to pay for poor students because of the endowments built up over the years by these former students.  The value of a prestigious school is mostly the connections you make along the way. Legacy students are are the  connections."}
{"prompt": "CMV: Despite being a Christian, I think it's wrong to teach young people that sex outside of marriage is sinful, as it can be psychologically damaging I am a Christian who believes that marriage is special (any kind - gay or straight). Yet, I don't think sex before marriage is wrong. I do, however, believe that teaching young people - especially girls seemingly - that sex outside of marriage is sinful leads to psychological issues that can affect them throughout their life.   I have heard of various cases where, after a marriage has taken place, the couple are unable to consummate their union because they are unable to shake the mentality that what they're doing is sinful and dirty. If you teach someone from a young age that sex is an act of sin, it doesn't matter if you add the clause that it's okay in a marriage bed, the damage is done.   This doesn't seem to be a mentality that is easy to shake and can often lead to cases where sex is always uncomfortable, people have turned away from religion, or non-religious therapy has been sought out - or all three.   I'm open to having my view changed (obviously) but at the moment I think that nothing good can come of this kind of teaching. I don't think sleeping around is not sinful, but I think that marriage is special regardless of whether or not you've had sex before - and that new married sex life will be more comfortable if you've not had to same teaching that sex is dirty.", "preferred": "The problem is that you're rooting this in the false idea that Christians think sex is somehow dirty in and of itself, and somehow only allowed in marriage because it's the best possible use of a bad thing. That's actually flat out heretical.  Sex is something that is meant to bring us closer to God. It brings a married couple, who have already taken the step to join to each other and God in a sort of miniature Trinity, one step further by helping them participate in God's creative nature through sex and procreation. This is the best possible use for sex. Anything short of that, strictly speaking, simply isn't sex at all from a Christian perspective.  Sex outside of the love and commitment of marriage is something less than sex that has those qualities. Sex with a piece of latex between the two people is something less than sex that has the full physical contact. These are, at their base, shabby attempts to trade out qualities of real sex for something that is degraded, cheap, and requires no self control, no love for the other person, and no concern for the possibility of participating in God's creation in that way.", "rejected": "> Yet, I don't think sex before marriage is wrong.  How do you justify this belief when Christianity considers fornication a sin? I mean, you're diluting Christianity --and sinfulness is a huge part of it-- in order to justify your own beliefs re. what's psychologically healthy. Aren't you doing those who engage in sin a disservice by looking the other way?  Of course, the proper way to think about this is to abandon Christianity altogether and thus approach  the issue without the unnecessary baggage of theology. Perhaps that's too radical for a Sunday?"}

{"prompt": "I exposed my chest at work as proof I had breast cancer after boss and coworker were spreading rumors that I didn\u2019t actually have cancer. Arkansas I had breast cancer about a year and a half ago. I got surgery and took FMLA. Luckily I didn\u2019t have to undergo chemo or radiation. Surgery was able to remove all my tumors. I still have check ups and screenings occasionally and have to miss work. Another coworker in another department has breast cancer but unfortunately was unable to hand it removed by only surgery and had to be out longer. She is still undergoing treatment.   I declined reconstruction on my breasts so I was able to come back to work at 3 1/2 weeks. My FMLA is intermittent. I do take it occasionally for those check ups and screenings because I am at high risk of it returning.   I have no breast on my left side (just a flat scar - no breast tissue) and I have no nipple and only a smaller amount of breast tissue on my right side (they removed a lot of breast tissue with a lumpectomy but were able to salvage about 55% of the breast tissue). I have no nipples.   I did something very dumb because I am a very dumb person.   My coworkers and my immediate supervisor have been talking about my breast cancer for weeks because I had to miss an important meeting for a breast MRI and a bone scan. I requested off. Got my manager and HR to approve it. Converted under my FMLA signed by my oncologist.   They have been spreading rumors that because I came back to work so soon that I didn\u2019t have breast cancer. I wear a prosthetic at work so no one sees me flat. They are saying everyone they know with any cancer always has to take a lot of time off work and I seem fine.   They (coworkers and supervisor , not my manager or HR) are saying I am abusing FMLA.   Someone said they saw me out at the store (after an oncology appointment that was approved by my manager I did stop by the grocery store on my way home) and I looked fine. Again I am not on chemo so my appointments are check ups and blood draws. I feel fine after. They are emotionally draining but physical I feel great.   It got to the point where I was scared to even take appointments because I knew coming back to work would be the worst. Again, my manager has always been supportive and HR too. This is just my supervisor and my coworkers.   I have a surgery coming up to help with some scarring. They are just going to clean up some of the tissue now that everything has healed and I have been cancer free for over a year. I let my supervisor know they are thinking about scheduling it for the summer and he said \u201cright the cancer thing again\u201d.   One particular day last week, I got upset because I heard them in the office next door talking about me. They were saying I was scamming everyone and that I didn\u2019t deserve the upcoming raises. About how I didn\u2019t have cancer. I got upset and I walked over and I lifted my shirt and prosthetic bra and showed them the scars on my chest. I did cover my remaining 55% there breast with no nipple with my hand but my scars were on display for all to see.   I then told them to go fuck themselves and went back to my desk. This was on Friday at 3:30 pm. I left at 4:30 like I always do. No one has said anything. It is now Monday and I am worried. I had time to think over the weekend and realized it was a huge mistake.

The only reason we're interested in light-sails is that in the inner solar system, with very very thin metal foils we can sorta-kinda conceive of eventually making a sail that's lightweight enough to use for useful things.  I am still skeptical if we'll ever get there, but it's a lot closer to reality than a photon thruster.  Some math here:  http://umdberg.pbworks.com/w/page/50455623/Momentum%20of%20a%20laser%20beam  ***EDIT: In case it wasn't clear, Example 1 is about a spacecraft propelled by a laser, without any sails involved.***  A 1 watt red laser pointer produces about 3.4\\*(10\\^-9) newtons of thrust.  Producing 1 watt of laser power costs about about 350g if you use this RTG https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-mission\\_radioisotope\\_thermoelectric\\_generator and requires a laser diode, wiring, heat dissipation, satellite structure, pointing, et cetera, so lets's optimistically say 1kg.  What would it take for a satellite in low Earth orbit to use this mode of propulsion to escape?  Getting a 1kg mass out of Earth orbit requires a high-thrust delta V of about 3.2km/s.  https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/1ktjfi/deltav\\_map\\_of\\_the\\_solar\\_system/ Very-low-thrust delta V, with a slowly widening circle instead of a point thrust into a higher ellipse, is typically twice this number.  To move 1kg through a delta V of 6.4km/s using 3.4\\*(10\\^-9) newtons of thrust will involve accelerating at 3.4\\*(10\\^-9) m/s per second for 1.88\\^(10\\^12) seconds, or about 60,000 years.  \\-----------------  ***EDIT: In case it wasn't clear, Example 2 is about a spacecraft propelled by a solar sail, without any lasers involved.***  Now, let's compare.  A 1 square meter solar sail at Earth orbit that's made up of Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil, 16.26 \u00b5m thick, will weigh 43.9g.  If it's oriented correctly, the light falling on the sail will represent about 1361 watts of power.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar\\_irradiance#2011\\_reassessment  Because it's absorbing the power and then reflecting it back in the opposite direction, you get to count that as the same amount of momentum as if it was emitting twice that much power, 2722 watts.  I'm going to take a big fudge factor here and assume it's the same relationship of watts to thrust as our red laser pointer earlier, with the understanding that this is probably off by a bit: 2722 \\* 3.4\\*(10\\^-9) newtons = 9.255\\*(10\\^-6 newtons).  To move 43.9g through a delta V of 6.4km/s using 9.255\\*(10\\^-6) newtons of thrust will involve accelerating at 2.1\\*(10\\^-4) m/s per second for 3.048\\*(10\\^7) seconds, or about 0.96 year.  An improvement of about 60,000x.  So: Surprisingly doable.  The issue is mostly in how you go from aluminum foil to functioning, structurally supported, steerable spacecraft with a real payload, where we're still many orders of magnitude behind what a mission demands.  There's a secondary issue in figuring out how far we can push foil thickness without tearing, what the best way to unfurl foils without tearing them is, et cetera; A reduction in mass of the whole spacecraft by 50% represents a doubling in acceleration of the whole spacecraft.  At the moment, I have hope that maybe the new \"electric sail\" concepts will be more practical than light sails for maneuvering in the inner solar system.  (Corrections welcomed, this is all quick napkin math with Google Search unit conversions)", "rejected": "Yes 100%, the relevant equations are  the energy of a photon (energy required to produce the photon) is   E=hf, where h is Planck's constant and f is the frequency.   This energy relates to momentum via the full version of E=mc\\^2 which is   E\\^2=(mc\\^2)\\^2 + (pc)\\^2    c is speed of light and p is momentum   As photons have no mass it simplifies to   E= pc  then put together the momentum of each photon is hf/c = p   If you plug in numbers into this equation it becomes clear very quickly an absurd amount of energy is needed to produce a tiny amount momentum. As producing entire particle to throw out the back of a vessel to push it forwards is much more energy intensive then just have a bunch of prepared particles to throw out the back not having to expend the energy creating them and only expending energy throwing them."}

{"prompt": "CMV: being fat is always the result of lifestyle, not factors beyond control. Firs off I want to clarify that I know there are medical conditions that cause people to gain weight. I've seen it myself, when people in my life started taking some medications, their weight simply went up despite any significant change in what they eat or do.  However, I do believe that this \"forced\" weight gain is limited and not enough to push someone into obesity or even significant fatness.  Afterall, a person can't gain weight on and on if they don't keep eating a caloric surplus.  For people in this situation, mantaining an ideal weight might be too hard, as in requiring a change of habits that could be very hard to sustain, especially for people who cannot, for various reasons, control what they eat meticulously (thinking for example about people who eat every day at the company canteen, and thus cannot bring their lunch everyday).  For everyone else, I do believe that being normal weight is 100% achievable through careful choices.  I do acknowledge that there are environmental factors that lead someone into being fat. Education / upbringing as well as economic factors that make it harder to eat properly. A rich person can have nutritious and healthy food delivered every day, a poor person probably has a hard time affording anything but unhealthy food.  However this is not an obstacle that people simply cannot ever overcome. There are always strategies, if people want, to eat a proper amount and drop to a normal weight over time.

{"prompt": "CMV: The reason racism is still so prevalent in the American South is because the Confederacy was not sufficiently shamed for their human rights abuse. Compare the Confederacy and their dehumanization of black people to the Nazis and their dehumanization of Jews. Germany performed significant penance through reparations and worked hard through foreign policy to earn back the trust of the rest of the world. They paid financially and they paid psychologically. They acknowledged their guilt and place in history. Because of this, Germany has become one of the most trusted and prosperous nations in Europe.  While my American history is spotty (sorry, but I\u2019m here to learn), it seems as though the Confederacy was never made to bear full responsibility for their slaveholding ways. I recognize that it was not so easy to draw a bright line on slavery in the same way one could on the holocaust, because the practice of slaving had also taken place in the North. That said, it seems to me like the Confederacy were not universally and publicly shamed into feeling guilty and making amends like the Germans were. The fact that it is still acceptable in the south to be proud of your murderous past, and to revere those who fought to preserve inhumanity is mind boggling to me. Statues were built of these people after the fact.

However, to fully answer your question, this link might help. Take it with a grain of salt; I don't know how accurate it is. But it claims that men can go through something called Irritable Male Syndrome, since hormones can affect men just as much as they affect women.

This \"de-polarizes\" the nerve cell and we feel \"ouch!\"  Sensitive-teeth toothpaste basically work by flooding the outside of the nerves with K+ ions, from its active ingredient Potassium Nitrate.     This stops the \"pain signaling\" from working. The abundance of K+ ions outside the nerve cells stops the K+ ions inside the cells from flowing out.

I personally find the degree to which we praise our country and place ourselves so highly on a pedestal is a bit much, sure I guess we are a decent country, but yknow we think we\u2019re all tough beans and that kind of makes us look like a idiot and kinda inconsiderate to the rest of the world. Americas a fine country, but it never was perfect, and the best country? I don\u2019t even think there is a best country. All countries for the most part have multiple factors to them, in such a way that makes it extremely difficult to rank them.

Indeed, the motto of the most recent Republican president was MAGA.... implying that we're not as great as we were in the past. The right is constantly expressing negative attitudes toward all things American, from our colleges and Hollywood to even the CIA, CDC, FBI, and the \"deep state\" in general. They don't even trust American elections.  And the left tends to think that most of the country and all of its institutions are racist, sexist, and transphobic. The left sees most of the police as systemically unjust, corrupt, and deeply racist. When you read a book by a leftist academic rarely do you find anything positive said about the country.  So my counter-argument is that most people---far from feeling pride in their country---actually feel that we are in decline and and not doing very well."}

{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old: When somebody dies of cancer, what exactly is the actual reason the body stops working?", "preferred": "Cancer is a general term we use to describe any disease where cells in the body begin to divide in an uncontrolled fashion, often fast and with a very high mutation rate (so the cells begin to not look or function like those from the area of the body where they started). Cancer can be confined to a small area, or break off, travel through the blood stream, and lodge elsewhere to grow (we call that \"metastasis\" or \"spreading\").  Cancers kill by growing a bunch of the wrong cells in the wrong place. They can physically tear up organ tissue, block blood flow, cause internal bleeding, stop usable blood cells from being made... They effectively choke out organs to the point where the organs can't function and dies off. If the cancer has spread through the body, then many parts of the body will be failing at the same time.  Cancer death is typically due to organ failure, but the specifics of how it grows, the parts of the body affected, how it develops, etc. all depend on the particular type of cancer.", "rejected": "Its not the same for every case of cancer, but a generalisation would be 1 of 2 things.  Either the tumours are taking up too much nutrients/space from other organs and thus causes those organs to fail.   Or tumours block off something important like airways or arteries/veins."}

{"prompt": "CMV: I solely blame the current state of the Covid-19 pandemic in America on anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers. As of the creation of this post, the US now sees about 2000 deaths per day due to Covid-19. We haven\u2019t seen this many deaths per day since March, and with the delta variant of the virus spreading, we\u2019re starting to regress as far as getting over this pandemic is concerned. We\u2019re starting to go back to the point where schools are closing again, businesses are being forced to limit themselves and the people they serve, mask mandates, basically we\u2019re going back to the kind of limitations and restrictions that we had to work around with during the beginning stages of the pandemic.   The culprit behind the rise in Covid-19 cases, deaths, and the subsequent reactions is due to the tens of millions of people that refuse to get the Covid-19 vaccine and refuse to wear a mask in settings where they\u2019re around multiple people. The vast majority of people being hospitalized and dying of Covid-19 are unvaccinated, and now it\u2019s getting to the point where they\u2019ve overburdened hospital\u2019s quite badly.  So with that being said, I completely blame every anti-vaxxer and anti-masker for the current state of the pandemic. This is all their fault. If these people had just worn masks like they were told to without being stubborn assholes and gotten the vaccine months ago when they became widely available, this pandemic would have been greatly reduced and we would be on the back end of it, perhaps even eliminating it. Every person that refuses the vaccine and doesn\u2019t wear a mask when required to is part of the problem, and I\u2019m tired of pretending that they have a point or could be half right. They\u2019re making everything worse for all of us and holding us back from beating this God awful pandemic.", "preferred": "Just because you\u2019re against forced vaccinations doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re against vaccinations.", "rejected": "I\u2019m vaccinated and have been for a while now. But seeing how common breakthroughs cases are occurring I think it\u2019s safe to say even if we somehow managed to vaccinate every single person in the world Covid-19 would not simply go away and we would soon enough see a surge in cases as soon as the effects of the vaccine wear off, which varies for everyone depending on health status. We\u2019re told the vaccine is the best way to combat the disease but if you\u2019re vaxxed and not doing your part in taking care of your personal health a vax alone still may not save or prevent you from catching it. I think at this point we must accept this virus is one that\u2019s here to stay. I believe it\u2019s appropriate to encourage the vaccine and, in some cases, yes require it. But I believe it\u2019s equally appropriate to encourage people to excercise, eat healthier, choose a healthier lifestyle, and also not to stigmatize and scrutinize other forms of treatment or medication that may aid in one\u2019s recovery of the virus."}

{"prompt": "[DC] Why does batman make Robin's uniform so brightly colored?", "preferred": "It's not Batman doing it, it's Robin. Robin makes Robin's uniform so brightly colored. There's a lot of different canonical explanations for why he does it but typically it's because it reminds him of his parents. We're also talking abt OG Robin Dick Grayson here. Jason, Tim, Steph, and Damian sorta just took up the Robin mantle and didn't majorly change the design aspect of the costume much, except Damian.   Anyways, the explanation I best remember and I think is the most wholesome is from The Batman (2004).   When Dick is first introduced his parents are alive and they're in Haly's Circus. Dick is wearing a red and green \"leotard\" as his \"uniform\" for the Flying Grayson's stuff. Dicks like \"ah why do I have to wear this thing it's ugly blah blah blah\" then his mom says something like \"because you're my little Robin\". His parents die, Bruce is in the audience, Bruce adopts him.  Dick then discovers his adoptive father, Bruce Wayne, is Batman. The whole \"woah this is the batcave and you're batman\" thing happens. I kinda forget how but Dick asks Bruce (I think) to be a crime fighter like him. Bruce says yes badda-bing badda-boom he's Robin.   Dick goes to suit-up and he puts on the red and green leotard but now he has a yellow/black cape, a domino mask, and a yellow R on his chest. Bruce is like \"that's what you're gonna wear? Not the most discrete? What are you even gonna call yourself?\" It's been a few years since I've seen it but Dick says something like \"Because it reminds me of who I am and where I came from. I am Robin...\" Bruce says something like \"Hmmm. Batman and Robin, I like the sound of that.\"  Bruce knew how important his own parents were in his life, and he knew how important Dicks parents were in his life. He was not gonna fight Dick over the costume because I'm sure he felt that Dick need some remembrance of what life used to be, what life used to be with his parents, before the dark days. Wholesome Bruce move imo.   And the rest was history. Does that answer your question?", "rejected": "In a lot of versions Robin designed the uniform himself."}
{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old: We all know plastics aren't biodegradable and that's bad, so why can't we just use chemical science to break them down ourselves?", "preferred": "We can turn just about anything into just about anything else, given enough time and energy. The problem is that those things cost a lot of money.  Pretty much all of our environmental problems are not caused by a lack of good alternatives, they are happening because all of the other options are more expensive. Whenever you can push the costs off onto \"someone else,\" there is no incentive to do things like make sure the waste from the products you produce or consume doesn't stick around in the environment doing damage for thousands of years.  This is why you absolutely _need_ good regulations. If you don't have them, then anyone who makes or sells anything will find a way to do it such that they get the maximum possible profit, and everyone else bears the maximum costs. To give a simple example, if you have some gold on your property, the cheapest way to extract it is to grind up the gold ore, mix it with water and cyanide, and then filter out the liquid and sprinkle zinc dust on it to make the gold precipitate out. What do you do with all the leftover cyanide? Well, you don't want to dump it on your own property, so the cheapest thing to do is dump it on your neighbor's property, or in the closest river. Obviously that's bad for everyone else, but if you have no conscience and nobody stops you from doing it, it's the most economical way. Of course, that's only true because you are ignoring the _externalized cost_ - the cost someone else pays (your neighbor, or whoever else needs that river water, or future generations).  This is the problem for all environmental issues - people who make money off of some product or service find ways to push as many costs as possible onto other people. The less organized and weaker those people are, the better this works. If the local oil refinery dumps chemicals onto the ground in a poor neighborhood, how hard is it going to be for the people living there to stop them, or to be compensated for the damage? If the people show up and start dumping their trash on the oil refinery's property, how likely are they to get away with it? Those power imbalances create situations where it becomes extremely easy for companies to externalize costs and spread them out to everyone else, while making billions for themselves.  CO2 in the atmosphere is another great example. The oil industry makes hundreds of billion of dollars per year in profits, but they can only do that because the hundreds of _trillions_ of dollars that dealing with the effects of climate change will cost are going to be paid by everyone else. If they had to pay that cost to produce gasoline or coal (for example), they'd never do it.  With plastics, we don't really know the long-term externalized costs. We know that the plastic doesn't ever disappear, it just breaks down into smaller and smaller particles. We know those particles are everywhere now - in you, in unborn babies, in all the food we eat, in our water, even in the air. We have no idea what kind of harm that is going to cause, or how to deal with it.  The plastics industry became very wealthy selling these products, and we enjoyed using them, and it all seemed like a great idea because _someone else_ is going to pay the true costs.  We could replace just about all of these plastics with biodegradable ones. It might cost twice as much, so now that $1 toy you bought at the dollar store would cost $2. Would it be worth it? I think it would be. But if you put a regular person in the store and show them two of the same item, one costs $1 and one costs $2, most people will go for the cheaper one. Maybe if you educate them and teach them how bad those non-biodegradable plastics are, some people would go for the more expensive option, but in general the cheaper one wins.  An easy way to fix it is to tax single-use and non-biodegradable plastics. Make them cost as much or more than the biodegradable options, and suddenly those externalized costs are put back on the producer and the consumer, and they'll make the environmentally responsible choice out of their own self-interest.", "rejected": "There are some plastics that are biodegradable. Most of them are only really compostable under certain circumstances though.  We can do a lot of stuff with other plastics too, but it is always about cost and revenue. A high percentage of clean plastic material can be recycled, but it has to be quite clean indeed. And washing/sorting ist costly again, unfortunately."}

Khoresh Karafs, a curiously delicious Persian celery meat stew.  And of course red or green pozole.  I love stews especially in cold weather. Great low carb food too.

Maybe hot sauce, or soy sauce/tamari, or worcestershire sauce, or gochujang, or smoked paprika or some Mexican smoked/dried chilies, or pomegranate molasses or Chinese black vinegar or balsamic or tamarind concentrate or kokum, or dried limes or pickled limes.  Finishing touches - i like how Southeast Asian noodle/soup dishes and Mexican pozole do this. They have a bunch of toppings that everyone can put to customize. It could be anything or everything. From diced scallions or onions, to fried crispy shallots or crispy fried garlic (just buy a box of it), to chili crisp oil, to chicharones or chips or nachos, to pickled veggies, to cilantro, to diced jalapenos or serranos, to lime that can be squeezed on top. Could even be a fine diced sour fruit like mangoes. Or hot sauce.  Edit: I too have a bad habit of overcooking the veggies. One thing that works is to par-cook the chopped veggies in steamer bags in the microwave for 2-3 minutes and then add them in the last 5-10 minutes of cooking. This is handy for pressure cooking as you don't want to depressurize the cooker just to add veggies midway or towards the end."}

{"prompt": "Where did the massive amount of the sand that forms the Sahara Desert come from?", "preferred": "The sand is primarily derived from weathering of Cretaceous sandstones in North Africa. When these sandstones were deposited in the Cretaceous, the area where they are now was a shallow sea.

These sand deposits eventually formed into sandstone, and as they were uplifted began to weather and break down into sand again.   Only about 10% of the Sahara is actually covered by sand, and parts of the Sahara are in fact covered by soil.

{"prompt": "Underperforming Manager [CA] Is there something I am missing from a California HR perspective that might explain the lack of action regarding this situation?  Seven months ago, we hired someone who seemed a perfect fit coming from the same industry. He was very articulate / knowledgeable and was able to answer every question with depth and fluidity. The position was a step up from Senior Marketing Manager to Director and he was to lead a product launch for us. We\u2019re based in California but due to COVID did not require him to move from the East.  Despite being a multinational company we\u2019re small and wear a lot of hats. Every group that interviewed him explained this repeatedly. The new product was virtually the same he said he had launched several times before.  He had trouble getting started. We\u2019d try to help and recommend what to start and why. We gave examples. I made several attempts to on-board him, but he pushed me off. The VP (who used to run Marketing) was forced to sit in on multi-hour meetings 2x a week to work through his deliverables. The VP would ask what he finished since we last met and he\u2019d say \u201cnothing\u201d. He has not had one meeting with anyone that wasn't specifically related to a part of the project he was working on. Those meetings were maybe 15 minutes. When he does step in it's usually an overstep like cancelling a meeting I booked with a vendor because he didn't understand why I needed it. He can\u2019t create a PowerPoint. He said he could write he can't. He doesn't know how to track projects, nor specs and verbiage. He does not know how to write a creative brief, nor did he know why one is needed. He doesn't know how to manage a budget. He was $20K over - to sustain a program, we need to come in 30% under. In this case that was a $60K discrepancy. This was explained early on. He did not know that he was supposed create a go-to-market plan. We asked him who he thought would be doing it and he named somebody not even working on this launch. He was late on every deliverable. We're not talking hours or days - weeks late. There was always the promise that we would receive the final within the next hour or the next day or Wednesday or by 4:00 PM or or or. After much delay he would admit he didn't understand the assignment and he needed some guidance which meant someone else would step in and do it HE LIES - says things are done and they're not started. He says he can't open the document that he got from the agency, but it turns out the agency has never been briefed. He flat out lies about everything to everyone. Our agencies are frustrated. He does not follow; he does not lead, and he doesn't get out of the way. He has made all our jobs so much more difficult.

I am also responsible for packaging, product naming, internal creative direction, photography, special \u2018corporate\u2019 projects as well as social media strategy with one direct report for that task. I was also co-lead with my boss on the launch of this product. And, since he did not create a go to market plan, I pulled together a 13-page plan and a new way to track projects and budgets - All of which I shared with the VP.  Several people in and out of Marketing have spoken to the VP who had been an AWSOME Marketing boss especially for someone without a Marketing background.

I just am sick of trying to convince him that out of date chicken can't be made safe again by storing it in marinade. He takes chicken that expired yesterday and puts it into marinade in a metal pot, covers it with foil, and stores it in the fridge, eventually cooking it over the next week or two.

{"prompt": "Can my dad really hire a bounty hunter to kidnap me from college and take me home? (MS/TN) I'm a freshman at a good school in Tennessee. My dad is a really difficult guy and has just gotten worse since I left for school. To make a long story short, when I stopped checking in every day he started calling the dean, and when the dean's office stopped taking his calls he started showing up here. The school really had my back and banned him from campus.   Now he's calling my friends and their parents and saying I have to come home (my mom won't take his calls anymore and the court won't make her). My dad says that I \"lack the legal standing for self-determination\" because I'm a minor, since in Mississippi you're a minor until you're 21. He says that he's hired a \"youth transportation service\" to \"escort\" me home. Like those people who kidnap gay kids in the middle of the night and take them to conversation camps. Bounty hunters for kids.   I told him that the fugitive slave act is a goner and that I only have to obey the laws of the state I'm in, which designates me an adult with the right to remain unkidnapped. He said that I'm bound by the \"long arm statute\" and that I haven't even established residency in Tennessee because I've only been here since mid-August and I'm still registered to vote in Mississippi.   So I guess my main question is my title: is he right, can he really send someone to kidnap me and take me back to Mississippi? My mom says this is just him being crazy and trying to intimidate me but obviously I want to cover all my bases.  If he's wrong, what can I do if that actually does happen? If some guy comes up to me and zipties my hands and says I have to go with him, do I? Can I fight back? If my friends are nearby and see me being kidnapped, can they help me? Since the episode that got my dad banned from campus, I've had a couple hefty guy friends offer to walk me back and forth from class. If one of them is with me and someone tries to take me, do they have to just let it happen, or do they have a right to help me not get kidnapped?  I think that's all my questions for now. Thanks!

{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old: How did lance armstrong not get caught for doping for so many years? If its that hard to get caught then should we be worried about other althletes?", "preferred": "Armstrong hired experts at doping who not only knew about the latest and greatest drugs and how to incorporate them in a training regime but also exactly how the anti-doping agencies worked and what they were able to detect and how. So they planned the entire season including training sessions and competitions around how they were getting the best out of each drug and how to avoid getting caught.  The hard part about detecting these drugs is that most of the drugs they take are the exact same chemicals that the body makes naturally but in different quantities. In some types of doping you are even tricking the body into making its own drugs. So while you may be able to detect a certain chemical that is supposed to be there and it is hard to prove that the chemical is the process of doping rather then naturally generated by the body.  A typical regime would include injecting steroids during the off season to promote muscle growth during training. Then a period without any drugs to get them out of your system. Then taking out lots of blood from your system to be used later. For the buildup to the season you would take EPO to promote the production of more red blood cells. This can be kept up throughout the competition season. Other drugs such as pain killers and verious hormone treatments may also be taken to help restitution and to make it easier to compete. If the EPO is not enough to give you superhuman blood count then use some of the blood from the off-season and give yourself a blood transfusion.  Armstrong was not the only cyclist who were doping himself. There are few people he competed against who we can clear of doping, largely because they were losing to all the doped riders. The Tour de France have even given up trying to hand out some of their gold medals as the previous holder was found to be doping because they have to go so far down the list of competitors that there is no point any more. And cycling is not the only sport with doped athletes.  The good news is that we are actually catching the doped athletes. Sometimes years after the fact but we are getting much better at it. Samples taken at events can be stored for long times until they can be tested using new techniques. And it have become more and more common to test throughout the year so that athletes can not dope themselves during the off-season. And we will notice jumps in natural hormones.", "rejected": "Oh my yes.  Armstrong said it himself, everybody dopes.  Especially the winners.

{"prompt": "A golfer hit my wind shield with a golf ball and completely destroyed it. Neither insurance company will cover it (Florida). I was driving home from work and I experienced a loud bang in my wind shield and I almost crashed. After coming to a complete stop, I realized a golfer sliced a ball into my windshield. Since he was the only one within a few hundred yards, it was obvious what happened. I called him over and I took a picture of his license and insurance card. I have USAA (liability) and he has Security National (falls under Bristol West). USAA said they would have covered it if I had comprehensive coverage because it\u2019s a Florida law that they would have to, but I didn\u2019t have comprehensive so they said to contact his insurance company. His insurance said since he wasn\u2019t operating a vehicle when he caused the damage, they won\u2019t cover it.

You can't sue God or the City Forester.  I mean, you technically could, but I doubt it'll get you anywhere.  So, my advice on next step is to search around for discounts (groupon typically has a few that offer something like $15 for a $100 credit towards a window) to replace the window and then ask your insurance what the cost of comprehensive is and consider adding it to your policy.  If the cost doesn't outway the potential pain of making repairs or loosing your car to \"an act of god\" then it might be worth it.", "rejected": "In most states, A player playing golf under normal circumstances is not liable for property damages caused by their errant golf shot.

About six months later I start getting collection notices for various healthcare facilities for obstetric services. So I call them up to dispute, right? Surely a mistake. But they have my health insurance info, a copy of my (stolen) drivers license. All of the health info is in my name.

{"prompt": "Looking to buy a (KitchenAid) stand-mixer. Would you recommend head tilt or bowl lift? Why? Thanks in advance!", "preferred": "Nobody can recommend you anything based on your question because it entirely depends on what you're making.  For the average home cook (using it once maybe twice a week with small to medium batches of cakes, batters, cookies, whipped eggs/cream and the occasional bread/enriched dough) you're better going for the best tilt head you can afford. You'll have no problems and if well looked after it will last you a lifetime.  If you're a super keen baker dealing with more bread doughs, enriched doughs and kneading based tasks, or larger batch sizes on a frequent basis (multiple times a week to daily) you want to start looking at the bowl lift models.  There are really only 3 differences, the size, motor strength, and construction.  The bowl lifts come in large sizes with more powerful motors to compensate for the increased resistance larger batches incur when beating or kneading. the other key point in the longevity is the weak points in the design. The tilt head mixers have a hinge and the torque force applied by the motor is forced through that hinge to knead whatever is in the bowl and the hinge will always have a small amount of what an engineer would call \"play\" which is a small gap added by design to ensure that the hinge always operates smoothly when the parts are made within their tolerance. The more frequently you ask the motor to pass stronger forces through that hinge, the more rubbing and grinding the hinge will do against itself and that play will gradually increase over the years. A bowl lift mixer doesn't have this problem because it has a solid piece of metal there instead of the hinge. This is what allows it to have a stronger motor and as a result a larger bowl capacity.", "rejected": "I have a lift and don\u2019t like as much as the tilt one I used when I lived at home.

{"prompt": "Why did the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster happen, in terms of the physical processes, and what did nucleate boiling have to do with it? I know that a test to see if the turbine could bridge the gap between a power outage and the startup of energency generators had been scheduled, and that the power output was way below what it should have been to safely run the test, but I don't quite understand what exactly happened. Why was the low power output an issue, why were the control rods taken out, and what generally went on?", "preferred": "The ultimate reason why Chernobyl failed was a design flaw.  Humans pushed the reactor to the point where the design flaw could rocket out of control.  One post describes the what the humans did very well, lets take a look at the physics.  Chernobyl was a **graphite moderated** reactor with **water cooling**.  This is unlike reactors in the US, as those are **moderated and cooled by water**.  In in the actual scheme of the Chernobyl reactors, **water was a poison in the reactor** (it absorbed neutrons before they could fission).   This is actually a well known effect, and the reason why CANDU reactors use heavy water.  As water boiled in the reactor, due to operator error, the density of it decreased, and therefore there was less poison per volume.  Less poison meant that the reactor produced more power output.  More power output meant more heat.  More heat meant more boiling.   You can see how this effect, under the right conditions, would cause a very violent steam explosion.  This is how Chernobyl blew its top.  It was not a nuclear explosion...it was steam pressure.  Secondarily, the reactor was now not being cooled after the structure was damaged, and the fuel melted, and was hot enough to cause the graphite to burn.", "rejected": "Nucleate boiling is typically how light water reactor fuel rods are cooled during normal operation.   Departure from nuclear boiling is the point where temperature can undergo a rapid transition to film boiling. Such a rapid temperature change can stress or even challenge fuel rod integrity. As such, solid fueled nuclear plants have a critical safety limit on their critical power ratio. CPR is the ratio of the departure from nuclear boiling to the current power output of the fuel rod. In a typical boiling water reactor, the worst case CPR shall be above 1.09 at all times including during accident condition. This ensures a 9% margin to the departure of nuclear boiling and a potential thermal challenge.    On a separate note the \"iodine pit\" article on Wikipedia is a decent reference to understanding how xenon and other poisons can affect a reactor. Most commercial nuclear plants can safely start up during the iodine pit (I witnessed one in the last few months in fact), but some designs (like the rbmk at chernobyl) are more sensitive to it, and the fact that safety systems were bypassed at chernobyl didn't help much either."}

{"prompt": "What was life like in places physically between the ancient civilizations that coexisted in time on the same continent, say between the Indus Valley and Mesopotamia? For instance, how \"civilized\" were those living between these civilizations relative to outside, what languages did they speak and how many people lived in those places relative to in the civilizations? Was there mass migration inward? How did word of the existence of these civilizations spread, and were there borders preventing these \"foreigners\" from entering?", "preferred": "I don't think a real attempt has been made to answer your original question with anything concrete, so I'll have a go! I'm going to use your original example of Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley because that might be instructive.  To start geographically, let's take a look at the regions that lie between Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley. A great deal of that inbetween-land is the Greater Iranian Plateau. This is the point through which contact or trade between these polities/cultures/groups of cultures would most likely have to pass in this era.  There are a number of mysteries regarding the ancient Iranian plateau. Those parts of it that were closest to Mesopotamia are decently known because they were referred to in their texts or because they had their own literature. In the case of Elam, we have both. Elam's position in the ancient Persian Gulf is a little tricky to explain now, as much of the Gulf would have been still underwater or marshlands at that time. But essentially, this region was centered around the modern Iranian province of Ilam all the way down to Fars.  **Elam**  Elam is therefore our first stop between Bronze Age Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley. Elam adopted the cuneiform script that Sumerian culture had developed for their own script, in much the same way that the Akkadians adopted cuneiform for their own needs later on. It was actually not the only script that the Elamites used! A script either developed within Elam itself or from further east is called Linear Elamite, as opposed to Elamite Cuneiform which I have just mentioned. The third is *another*, older riff on cuneiform. The difference between this script, known as Proto-Elamite, and the later Elamite Cuneiform is that the first one is much more pictographic and still not fully understood. Both references in Sumerian texts and Elam's own early inscriptions indicate that it was unified under a single kingship/dynasty on several occasions, even at this early point in its history. It's worth pointing out that even by 2000 BC, the important Elamite city of Susa was already almost two millenia old. We are dealing with a major culture with long roots and capable of competing with Mesopotamia. However, you can see that there seems to be evidence of exchange between the cultures, and we also know that they traded with one another.  The relationship between Elam and Mesopotamia was long and full of twists and turns. If the period I'm dealing with is somewhere around 2500-2000 BC, then bear in mind that Elam was still a competitor with the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the 800s BC.  **Problems**  We now reach a problem as we move into the rest of the Iranian plateau. Whilst Elam's own inscriptions have survived the test of time and we also have multiple Mesopotamian states giving their point of view, we cannot say the same for the rest of the plateau. It's not until the Achaemenid Empire (in the 6th century BC!) that we actually start getting a wide picture of what's going on in that part of the world. We have that most universal of problems that occurs when writing has not survived for a particular culture; we don't have much to go on!   However, not all is lost; archaeological knowledge of this era has been growing. And thanks to what we currently know, I can move on to the next section.  **Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex**  The region of the Iranian plateau that this refers to is one that is not considered part of modern Iran, this is why I initially started with the term 'Greater Iranian Plateau'. Bactria and Margiana are individual regions with their own history, but in the context of this period they're referred to in this way for reasons I will shortly explain. In addition, the region in particular that's been reconstructed as being the BMAC homestead is one that roughly straddles the Turkmenistan province of Mary with the Afghanistan provinces of Balkh and Jawzjan, give or take.  Now to talk about this slightly unwieldy title. It's a relatively formal title that's been given to a particular culture that existed at this point. It essentially means that the culture that lived in this area seems to have been using very similar material goods to one another, along with lots of other shared practises that indicate relative certainty in grouping them together. Bactria-Margiana is simply because of where it was located. However, this culture is also known as the 'Oxus Civilization'. The reason for *that* is because it was centered around a particular segment of the river known to the ancient Greeks as the Oxus, and known today as the Amu Darya. If we go back to the geography I mentioned earlier, you can see that this river originates quite far into Central Asia and flows all the way into the Aral sea. It's quite a big river. In fact, in ancient times it would have flowed all the way into the Caspian Sea.  Let me leap to the end a little bit; the BMAC, or Oxus Civilization, seems to have been quite developed. They utilised canals to take the nutrient rich Oxus and use it to fertilise the land around it, and did so from a relatively early point (around the late 2000s BC). It is likely that if this was transmitted, it was from Mesopotamia due to the relative longevity of the practice there and also the known timetable of which cultures/regions developed canal-based irrigation. They had developed urban environments, a high population density, and a vibrant material culture.  However, the reason that I'm having to deal in such cautious language is because we don't have any writing or writing system of any kind preserved for this culture! I don't usually subscribe to the idea of the 'civilization', but generally speaking the only thing missing from the traditional cocktail of what is called civilization in the BMAC is writing. It's also very frustrating; we don't know what language these people spoke. It could be an Indo-European language, in the which case they might have been speaking a precursor to Indo-Iranian languages. But it also might not have been! This means that the BMAC has a very awkward relationship with current arguments regarding Proto-Indo-European's homeland as a language. Depending on the verdict, the BMAC might seem to be smack in the middle of all of this. But again, it also could not!  However, the archaeology has been a little kind to us. I've mentioned this elsewhere, but a survey team attached to an archaeological site dating to Greek control of Bactria (so around 320-140 BC) accidentally uncovered a trading settlement in part of the Oxus valley that is quite clearly attached to the Indus Valley civilization. It's not simply a case of traded goods or inspiration, everything about the material culture of the site suggested that this was a trading colony. So whilst we can't read about it, we know for certain that the Indus Valley culture/cultures had an active interest in their relationship to Bactria.  **Conclusions**  These were almost certainly not the only cultures/groups of cultures that lay between Mesopotamia and the Indus in this stage of the Bronze Age. Archaeological remains have been found in locations outside of these areas, but they are still so poorly understood that I have not yet encountered a publication that can tell me anything other than a catalogue of the items found and vague attempts to sort their relationship to one another. We definitely know that there were multiple states and cultures between India and Mesopotamia in later periods, but we are talking centuries (and in some cases millenia!) later. Bear in mind that the BMAC was as ancient to the Classical Greeks as the Classical Greeks are to us; a lot of things must have happened in the Iranian Plateau during that time, but we're only really aware of its wider context to any certainty starting in the 7th-6th centuries BC, 1300+ years after the Indus Valley Civilization, BMAC, and Mesopotamia all co-existed.  But what we can conclude is that there were trade routes that spanned this length. Proto-Elamite goods have been found in Bactria during this period, Bactrian goods in Elam, Elam and Mesopotamia all over the place, and some Indus Valley seals as far west as Elam. Despite the distances involved, there were relationships between these cultures. Indeed, Bactria's probably got a lot more to say regarding this than we are currently aware- in later periods, the river Oxus was used to ship goods from all over Central Asia into Europe via the Caspian sea, and camel caravans were a major source of income (though the gold deposits, massive agricultural wealth and jewels didn't hurt either!). Indeed, one thing to consider is that any piece of lapis lazuli found before a certain date in Europe, Africa, and West Asia, *must* have come from Bactria; there were no other known sources at that time.  From what we know of the settlement patterns, in this era (late 3rd millenium BC) most major concentrations of development and population focused on easily exploitable agricultural land. The river Oxus/Amu Darya can generate a lot of agriculture when used to irrigate the surrounding area, and the Western Iranian plateau has a number of areas in which intense cultivation is possible without the use of irrigation. Both Elam and Bactria-Margiana seem to have had a dense, settled population, and both were productive agricultural regions. Until we know more about this period, I think a relatively accurate principle is to assume major centres gravitated towards exploitable agriculture.", "rejected": "We know for a fact that there was direct trade between the Harappan and the Mesopotamian cultures - so any of these 'in between' people you ask of should be probably living along the trade routes. If so, perhaps they were small groupings that also acted as trade-posts?   Bah, if only the language of the Harappan culture were deciphered - a wealth of knowledge there, just waiting."}

{"prompt": "CMV: Films shouldn't be criticized for poor, inconsistent and irrational character motivation. Because we humans are, by nature, inconsistent and irrational. I see this a lot in movie discussions: criticism is often in the vein of \"Why would he do that? It doesn't make sense! Horrible movie, 0/10.\"  The story-telling experience doesn't need to spell out the whys, hows and wherefores of a character's action in the film. While it's good to hold the hand of the viewer and get them to understand the film-maker's POV, it isn't necessary, and characters in the film needn't have to justify why they did the things they did. We generally fail to account for inconsistencies in our behavior that's very much accepted in real life, but somehow the same inconsistencies are not acceptable for fictional characters. Viewers should be able to fill in the blanks when they can, like how it's done while reading books. It's rationalizing an action, and I think it's an important part of story-telling, but we also have to accept a character doing something \"just because\".  The last film I saw was \"Dirty Grandpa\". I didn't particularly like the movie, and I caught myself telling my girlfriend later that there was \"poor character motivation\". That's when I realized, how do I know the character motivations were poor? Robert deNiro wanting to fuck a college girl a day after his wife's funeral wasn't unrealistic: it was just that *my expectation* of his character was to mourn or show some sort of mental anguish. It wasn't explicitly shown in the film, and so my immediate reaction was to say, \"poor character motivation\".  I could tell myself that this was deNiro's way of mourning or coping, but I should also allow for the fact that his decisions and actions can be inconsistent without needing a reason to be. _____  > *Hello, users of CMV!

Moreover, they base their expectations on how a character would act in a given situation not only on their real-life experience with human psychology but on the specific tropes of storytelling, which can be subverted but that takes extra work to come across clearly.  For example, if an established superhero suddenly started harassing and beating up a helpless person, that would seem out of character not just because of human behavior but based on our shared cultural understanding of the fictional hero.  The simplest explanation is usually the best:  when talking about a fictional character who acted in a surprising and unconvincing way, it's simpler to posit that the writer just didn't think about the character's psyche very carefully or was a bad writer, rather than to assume the writer had a secret hidden idea of the inconsistent irrational behavior of their character that was completely true to life.  Especially a movie like Dirty Grandpa, how likely is it that they really gave it that much thought?", "rejected": "> I could tell myself that this was deNiro's way of mourning or coping, but I should also allow for the fact that his decisions and actions can be inconsistent without needing a reason to be.  That just seems like a poor example to me. That really seem to be something that a certain type of people I know might do. It seems to be excellent characterization more than anything.  One of my hobbies used to be, literally, tracing the origins of each of my thoughts as far as I could go. I never produced any thought that was genuinely original, and the only reason why I eventually failed at tracing is that I grew old enough that there were too many sources to track. I believe that my mind likely works in a similar way as everyone else.   Similarly so, there ought to be some plausible chain of reasoning or emotional potentiality that leads from point A to point B.   Frankly, I think this is one of the *only* things  that matter. A movie entertains the viewer or synthesizes a point about human nature. For the first, suspension of disbelief is required, which necessitates making the viewer comfortable and believing in the scenery. For the second, it requires an accurate representation of human beings and their actions (or it would be self-defeating due to inaccuracy.)"}

{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old: Why is acne so hard to get rid of?", "preferred": "You have different types of acne, so it\u2019s really difficult to just talk about one cause and propose one treatment to get rid of it.   Very broadly, you have three types of acne: comedonal acne, inflammatory acne, and drug-induced acne.  I\u2019ll just focus on the first two, because that\u2019s what most people are concerned about.     The root of most acne lies in the hair follicle.  Your skin produces oils called sebum to lubricate your hair and skin.  These pores can become clogged and produce comedones (which are your \u201cblackheads\u201d or \u201cwhiteheads\u201d depending on whether the comedone surface has been oxidized by the air).  If you want to treat comedonal acne, you need to use a topical retinoid (which is a derivative of Vitamin A) and this will interfere with sebum production.   Now in other cases, these plugged pores can become a site where bacteria take up residence, and this leads to pustules, papules, cysts.  This is inflammatory acne.  At that point, you need to add an antibiotic or two along with a retinoid to attack both problems.  So you really need a doctor to classify what type of acne you have before you can figure out what treatments you need.   Most people have acne in their teenage years because they have higher levels of steroid hormones (e.g. estrogen or testosterone) which promote sebum production and the development of comedones.  As their hormone levels stabilize through puberty, sebum production will level off.  I\u2019ll leave it to the dermatologists to tell you the best ways care for your skin.  But aside from medications, you want to keep your skin clean and moisturized at a level where you\u2019re not allowing sebum to build up, but your skin is also not too dry and cracked that your skin bacteria can invade and cause inflammatory acne.  Finding the balance can be difficult.", "rejected": "Because it can be caused or made worse by a lot of things.  Washing your face with the wrong soap can dry your skin out and cause it, but another soap can make your skin oily and cause it.  Washing too often can be an issue, but so can no washing.  Your diet can cause your skin to produce more oil, and exercising while often a way to clear your skin can also cause it.  A lot of what causes acne is thought to be genetic, but there's also strong arguments that it's environmental.  So without being able to pin down one exact cause you can only treat it, not prevent it outright- think of it like the common cold."}

Should I be getting told what projects I need to work on?  Here are some details about my situation: I worked here as an intern while pursuing my mechanical engineering degree. As a typical intern I was hired to just sit there, make copies and get signatures from time to time. Being bored, I decided to start a project on the manufacturing floor on my own. It actually became super successful and doubled the revenue per month through that department. After graduating, I was hired immediately.  After starting my new role, I was never really told what my job function or responsibilities were.

There isn't really research in philosophy, in the same sense there is in say chemistry or something. Like, as an undergrad there is no chance of you producing any remotely interesting or valuable chemistry research unless you're lucky enough to get an official lab position, your research in grad school will all be officially supervised projects, so that's what counts for getting a job.  Doing the same thing in philosophy, showing up to class, doing the research you need for a PhD, and expecting to get a full time middle class job as a professor, isn't a very realistic option...now should you have the idea that it was ever a realistic option, for those without wealthy parents!  The thing is any meaningful philosophical inquiry can be done on your own with no further resources than access to your university's library. If you actually want to be a philosopher, as a career, you need to think outside the box of traditional academia. Write a book. Make a YouTube channel. Pick an interest that's somewhat related to philosophy, nerd out, get good at it, and speak at a seminar or something. This will give you some side employment and make you much more competitive for the academic jobs that do arise. If your only focus is getting such a job you probably won't get it.  Really, and this is true for any PhD except for maybe engineering, you shouldn't do a PhD for the sake of maybe getting a job after. You should only do it if you're interested in the study. Are you interested enough in philosophy to have a topic you want to spend 5 years studying?  If the answer to that question is anything other than an emphatic \"yes\", I'd definitely advise keeping your options open. You should also keep an open mind as far as studying math; once you get through the boring slog of calculus and differential equations, higher level math courses are totally different and are more resembling of philosophy in that they are based around using logic to prove complex propositions rather than just using formulas to solve problems."}

Then one describing a boat in a canal where the walls of the canal were so close to the boat that the space was infinity small and that extra space was supposed to help me understand a curled dimension.

From your vastly distant perspective the carpet is entirely a 2 dimensional object. It only has length and width but you can detect no depth to it.   Now imagine you zoom down to the size of an ant crawling through the carpet From this closer perspective you are very much in a 3 dimensional world. Not only can you move in 2 dimensions across it, but you can move in a third dimension and burrow down deeper into the pile. What was a very simplistic world from 10,000ft has become a complex maze just by virtue of your scale and distance.  The idea of extra dimensions in string theory is essentially just more levels of the same. What if, instead of being the size of an ant and gaining just one dimension, you were now the size of an atomic nucleus. Would new 'directions' be revealed to you just like they were to the ant?

You now have 2 microscopic curled dimensions.   The thing to keep in mind that's probably tripping you up is your thinking of this as a 2D surface in a 3D Euclidean space. That's the thing you have to break up. The plane/sphere is the only thing that exists in the thought experiment. The third dimension, up-down doesn't make sense.

In fact, for extra snappyness, they keep it in RAM.

I want to ask questions about the career path or maybe the material itself but I'm not exactly sure what I should be asking, if that makes sense. So, I hope you fine folks can offer up suggestions about things you wish you knew when you started your first positions. It can be any field obviously, but I would hope that I can get some specifics about people doing design work in the aerospace industry. Thank you!

{"prompt": "CMV: College should be free because investing in an educated population is one of the most important investments for humanity. I don't mean paying for art, music or gender studies. (Not that those are unimportant) but we should pay for classes that pave the way for more and better doctors, engineers and any high demand careers.  Machines will eventually replace many jobs but we need more educated people to design, manufacture and maintain the world of tomorrow.  Putting people in situations where they have to work and go to school simultaneously is bad for their health (physical and mental) and can make for a poorer quality education.", "preferred": "College isn't for everyone. There are already too many people going to college and taking on student loans they would otherwise avoid if they went to a vocational school or did an apprenticeship. Making it free will only allow even more less qualified individuals to enter college and dilute the value of the degree, pushing the minimum education level for well paying jobs to a higher level like a Masters or PhD. So unless you want to make those free too, then college should not be free.   Instead, what I posit is we invest more in our k-12 education and make high school education more valuable for all. By increasing the standard of our k-12 education system, less qualified people won't have to go to college, which will drive demand down and eventually cost.   Right now, college is super expensive only because of its high demand and schools are spending tons of money to attract people willing to pay for better dorms, facilities, teams, etc. when in the end quality of education at the college level is pretty equal across the board with exception to the top tier schools. We desperately need to fix our k-12 education system if we want to fix the college problem naturally rather than sticking a bandaid on the issue and hoping for the best.", "rejected": "The incentives are all screwed up right now. The biggest beneficiaries of the current system are probably the industries who get relatively well-trained young (cheap) employees for free.  Having government pay for college simply incentivizes everyone to go to college, and the reality is that the country does not benefit when it sends average IQ students to college. High school is probably the right amount of \"free\" (government-provided) education.  Perhaps some system where companies pay for higher-education would be better -- it would likely produce the correct number of trained students, as companies will prefer to pay for only the right amount. This approach has its own challenges, to be sure, but perhaps there's a workable system in there.  If not, having the government pay, but with a system that aggressively prunes the number of accepted students would be needed. Far too many kids go to college right now."}
{"prompt": "Have I made a big mistake by not applying to a PhD at 26 (it keeps me up at night)? **Abstract**: *I am 26, finishing a master's degree, and I have no plans now and have never considered a phd. My professors and colleagues say i'm ideal, my parents are against it, all deadlines have passed, and I have an existential crisis now.*  I am about to finish my 2 year master's in International Relations at the age of 26 (in my country we graduate at 19 and I did a year of travel). It was such a big deal to me to even get into this program, because I originally have a B.Sc. in psychology and I'm the first one in my direct family line to even see a college from the inside anyhow. The hybris I accused myself of to even attempt a master's! I was so nervous whether I'd even survive the IR program that I spent exactly no time thinking about any further degrees afterwards.   Now that the end approaches, professors and my friends at grad school keep asking me why I don't do a PhD. One senior professor even approached me in a pub and said I was an ideal candidate, as I love academic discussions and research. My GPA is good and my supervisor really liked my master's thesis. But I was so focused to even survive the past two years, driven by constant impostor syndrome, that I never spent a second thinking I'd do anything else but \"a job\" afterwards, however vaguely defined. I made no plans for later at all.  My professors' and colleagues' comments have seriously thrown me in doubt whether I didn't do a huge mistake. My parents (both worked themselves up from poor backgrounds, without a college degree) painted an image of PhD studies as a dead-end into poverty and unemployability with short-term contracts only, so I never really considered it.  Obviously all deadlines have passed now by a long shot, and as all my friends move on to jobs (mostly non-related office jobs). I wonder if I didn't make a huge mistake by not applying, and whether that window of opportunity isn't closed now for good... or whether I made the right call.", "preferred": "Nothing has been closed for good.

{"prompt": "Neighbor barges into my house with minor daughter as I'm getting out of the shower, threatens indecent exposure charges. I live in a rural area. The residents around here let their dogs run free, and after one of them killed a neighbor's cat it ran onto my property, leading him to believe that the dog was mine. He came over with his minor daughter to yell at me. He didn't knock, he just tried the knob while yelling through the door, and before I could react he had the door open using a credit card and stormed into my home.  I was getting ready to go to work for the evening, had just gotten out of the shower and was waiting for my laundry to dry so I was in a state of undress. I did the best I could to cover up using objects on my kitchen table and ordered them to leave, but he just stood there yelling at me about being around his little girl naked. He threw every variant of the word \"pedophile\" at me that he knew, said I was going to land on the sex offender registry, and pulled out his cell phone as he and his daughter stormed out my home.  I'm aware of cases where an individual who was nude in their own home was hit with indecent exposure charges because they were seen from the sidewalk, but there is no way to see into my home from any public thoroughfare. If you look into the windows facing the road you'll only see the back of a pair of blackout curtains. The only window you can see into my home from would require you to be well onto my property. When I'm indoors the only ways to see me, whether fully dressed or fully nude, are to go onto my property 130 feet from the nearest point on the road to look through the one window I don't keep covered, I let you in, or you force your way in.  At work I talked to a county deputy, a state trooper, and the county prosecutor (retail in a small town. First two stop almost nightly for an energy drink, the prosecutor does his shopping on the way home on Tuesdays). I told them about the invasion. I would have given them the full story if I were talking to them in private because if I didn't explain something properly they would ask for clarification. The customers, however, would have latched on to the \"naked with a 9 year old in the house\" angle, dragged me out behind the store, and hanged me from the first tree we reached, figuratively if not literally.  All three asked the same questions. \"Were all exterior doors locked?\" They were. \"Did he cause any property damage while gaining entry?\" He didn't. Just used a credit card to force the latch back. \"Did he threaten you with a weapon?\" No. \"Did you record him on your property?\" No. They all arrived at the same response. Without property damage or video of the confrontation I couldn't prove trespassing or unlawful entry.  Since I didn't feel safe asking about the rest within earshot of the customers, many of whom know where I live, I'm asking here. Given that he bypassed a locked door without consent of the property owner and brought his daughter into the house do I have anything to worry about from them seeing me nude before I could conceal myself?  If it were just him I wouldn't worry about it. If he would have been here alone he only would file out of pettiness, and his knowledge that as early as tomorrow morning I could get video evidence of him exposing himself in view of a public space, as he can frequently be seen urinating in his front yard without even the slightest thought toward discretion, would keep that pettiness at bay. However, since a child is involved, especially if it's a case that goes before a jury, that whole \"innocent until proven guilty\" thing will likely go to \"hang him. In the unlikely event that he's innocent he probably did something else he should be hanged for.\"", "preferred": ">he had the door open using a credit card  Call the police and make a report.

{"prompt": "Is it possible to have a child on one Post-Doc salary in Boston Hi,   I am based out of Europe, just finished my PhD and am currently looking for Post-doctoral positions. For my search I have geographically limited myself to southern Europe. When I was a high-schooler I used to dream of doing frontier research in an Ivy-league institution. These days, I have the resume to make that dream a reality but need to reconcile them with my current situation. I got married last year and we want a child. We don't care much for the very low maternity leave in the US, so one of us will stop working to take care of the child. We have done the calculations and this scenario will most definitely leave our budget in the red taking into account emergencies that tend to come up year to year. Therefore, this leaves us no room for savings.   Obviously, the US cannot hold a candle to Europe when it comes to quality of life and social safety nets. So raising a family is better off in Europe. Furthermore, I know that Science is just science once you take away all the outer ornamentation. Finally, the European science community is extremely enviable in it's own right. Yet, I know that in my broader field of study, scientists in the US are a few years ahead of those in Europe. So my question is towards academics with families based out of Boston, New York the greater SF area or other equally expensive neighbourhoods.  \\- Are you able to save beyond pennies?   \\- Is my perspective one of grass being greener across the ocean?  \\- Is it possible to occupy a single housing unit (minimum 2 rooms) with a child in places like Boston, SF or New York on a single Post-Doc salary?  \\- Am I worrying over nothing?  \\- What is life like for you as a Post-Doc with a new family in terms of costs?

There the cost of living is low, and unlike Americans you don't have to save for your kid's college  fund because you can just send them off to college in Europe.  US salaries can get obscenly high at tenure track and beyond level, so if considered moving there later in your career, it might be possible.  But yeah, the PhD and postdoc way of life in the USA makes me wonder if it isn't just seen as a club for rich kids.", "rejected": "One post-doc salary for a family and no room mates to reduce bills will either mean living in a dump in a stressful area of town or a large commuting distance away.

{"prompt": "New Job Bait and Switch My background is as a marine engineer as a technical lead. Which is basically a system engineer leading the overall design for incorporating new or retrofitted systems onto older ships.

I never got an offer and the position was never filled (I was one of 2 people who interviewed, and I know the other person quite well).  So it is possible that upper management wants to improve the mechanical side, but your manager doesn't think it is important, and so won't let you do it.   If the person who hired you is not the same person who told you \"tough\", I would either get a written copy of the PD, or talk to the person who hired you about the problem.  Worst case your manager gets upset, best case you get to do what you were hired to.", "rejected": "If it's still an option, I'd look to get my old job back in the short run, or learn what I can doing the electrical work at the new job, and either way, look for another new job in the long run."}
{"prompt": "CMV: American political parties (specifically the two-party system) have wrongfully divided citizens and oversimplified political policies I believe that political parties have created a very harsh and distinct lines between political (and even non-political) issues.

In this past election, it's obvious that voters don't want one of the political parties to win, but they have no choice. Trump is not a true Republican and Bernie was barely a democrat. They both have many different views than their party, yet they were still highly favored by voters.  I'm not suggesting that we should get rid of political parties; instead, we should have some sort of reform to fix how rigid we are able to vote. Our whole government and voting system is centered on this two-party system, that has left America split in two. It's counter-productive. A democratic president gets elected and does one thing, then a republican president get voted in and tries to reverse everything the other guy did, and the cycle continues.

He should be able to, more than Goku even, because of how durable his body is and how he never runs out of energy. If he did that, he would have won damn near every fight he was in.", "preferred": "So the thing about the games is that they take place in another world -- as in events sometimes work *weird*, and the rules aren't the same.  For instance, Cell should not be able to use the Spirit Bomb, period. It's a technique that requires a pure heart to activate and survive, at least up to a threshold. You can't just *tell* the world to \"give you its stupid energy\". The games have a version of the Spirit Bomb he can use, but that's like... from nothing, breaking all the rules of the attack.  Similarly the Kaioken is a technique that requires extreme amounts of ki control and *emotional* control -- which is the main reason why Super Saiyans usually don't use it. The Super Saiyan state and Saiyan biology after its unlocking in general basically implies you're gonna be letting your power run loose and out of control every once in a while, which is antithesis to the Kaioken. Goku was only able to use the Kaioken alongside SSB because Blue requires you to *train* yourself into perfect ki control. It's the complete opposite of regular Super Saiyan. Blue is cool, Gold is hot.   So, due to needing to absorb energy that wasn't his in order to become stronger, Cell doesn't *actually* control his power very well. His Imperfect and Semi-Perfect are by nature in flux and don't have a baseline or ceiling of power, because they're defined by not being states he's gonna stop to experiment on. The Kaioken would just hurt him.   By the time he gets to Perfect and Super Perfect, he's both \"too good\" for power-ups and tapping into Super Saiyan, which we can ascertain by his aura mimicking the Super Saiyan structure (Perfect Cell gets golden, Super Perfect Cell gets golden with lightning bolts like SSJ2). *Even if* we don't think those Perfect states are an analogue for Super Saiyan, he still doesn't have the perfect ki and emotional control necessary for Kaioken. We see this because as soon as things start going Gohan's way, he *loses* it -- he gets flustered, he gets extremely angry, he gets sloppy. Gohan manages to upset him enough that he throws up #18.   All this to say, Kaioken is one of those things that you not only need to work for, you need to use it very specifically. Goku is a life-long martial artist with decades of experience with zen and meditation by the time he learns the Kaioken.

But they also carry curses and sickness from the underground realm of death and decay up to middle earth.  If a child won't grow right, we know that they have been struck with dwarf-growth, and use chants, spells, prayers and herbs to drive the dwarf from the house and make the child grow again. But if the child still won't grow right, it may be a changeling, a dwarf child swapped for the real child. The remedies for this is awful, and won't speak of them here.", "rejected": "In a fantasy setting where *Dwarves* are already an established (non-Human) racial group, I figure there are a handful of ways to disambiguate them from Humans with dwarfism.  The first would be through spelling and capitalization. (Basically the way Tolkien did it.)  The singular *\"Dwarf\"* and plural *\"Dwarves\"* refer to individuals belonging to the Dwarvish race, whereas *\"dwarf\"* and *\"dwarfs\"* refer to Humans that have dwarfism. Similarly, the adjective *\"Dwarvish\"* would categorize something as \"of the Dwarves\", and *\"dwarfish\"* as \"of the dwarfs\" (and/or perhaps \"kind of small\")...  The second would be through alternate terminology and euphemism.  *\"Dwarves\"* (or, really, however you want to spell it in this case) are their own established non-Human racial group in this setting, so the Human term of \"dwarfism\" was never coined / never really took off. Instead, Humans born with conditions that stunt their growth are referred with other names and phrases - \"midget\", \"short person\", \"vertically-challenged\", etc. - much as they sometimes (unfortunately awkwardly and/or derogatorially) are in real life...  The third would be to bury the disambiguation with in-story context, or to kind of ignore it altogether.  Maybe Humans with dwarfism are assumed to have Dwarvish heritage somewhere in their genealogy, and are referred to as \"half-Dwarves\" or something along those lines, regardless of whether or not that's actually the case. Or maybe Humans with dwarfism and \"Dwarves\" are (thought to be) one in the same - a person becomes a Dwarf by virtue of having that condition rather than (necessarily) through relation to any existing Dwarvish bloodlines - and are treated as more of a related social/ethnic group than as a completely separate race...  Ultimately, it's up to the writer to figure out how to best clarify confusing terminology like this, if they decide to even tackle it at all."}

The 20 week scan revelled that the liver, stomach, bowel and some gut are sitting in her chest, I won\u2019t go into detail of explaining what CDH is as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware and mobile device format is horrible.  They believe the hole is on the left side and have been unable to see the lungs as she\u2019s always in an awkward position (little wriggler)  We decided to go ahead with the amniocentesis and the results came back normal on both.   Everything is perfectly normal and healthy just that we can\u2019t see the lungs yet and can\u2019t accurately measure the waist due to the stomach being in the wrong place.

Our options are ECMO if she manages to respond well to the respirator and her lungs work with taking in oxygen and breathing out CM until she is strong enough for surgery to bring the organs down and place a patch of the required.  We also have an alternative procedure with balloons in the lungs before pregnancy to help her to swallow and build up strength, but comes with risk of premature labour which is not ideal as she needs to remain there to give her the best chance.   Another problem that comes with that is our specialist teams around the country aren\u2019t trained in how to remove the balloons and sometimes they become matted(this is what we are told) as the procedure is done privately not NHS  If I have missed anything I will edit everything is very foggy atm but we have got this and so much support from the wonderful team at the hospital.

He will have trouble breathing since his belly organs are located where his lung should be. When the time is right, he will go to surgery and for repair. He will have IVs, receive sedated medication, and have lots of blood taken and be attached to lots of monitors. Best case, he gets repaired and comes off the breathing machines and medications and comes home. CDH can be very dangerous and can be fatal. I dont want to stress you out but you need to know this condition can be veryyyyyy hard for the baby. It all depends on how long he stays inside of mom and how much his lung on the affected side is able to grow. The lungs aren\u2019t truly developed until 32 weeks when they grow \u201calveoli\u201d and can participate fully in gas exchange. Before that, their oxygen levels are very low and they have trouble breathing because of the low development. Since his belly is in the spot where his lung is supposed to be, the lung may be underdeveloped for life. He may need oxygen or a breathing machine 24/7, or he may be able to breathing without assistance after some time. I wish the best for you. ECMO is for severe cases. Where the body\u2019s oxygen is just so low that they bypass the lungs and oxygenate the blood outside of the body through the ECMO machine. \ud83d\udc95 CDH is very scary and I\u2019m so sorry you have to deal with this.", "rejected": "Wow, you are so brave as is your wife.

Some of these cans began to spoil, leading to the discovery of Deinococcus. The spoilage indicated these bacteria were resistant to these high doses of radiation.   Early research indicated the organism maintained multiple copies of its genome and had ridiculously efficient DNA repair machinery. These together were thought to be the basis of the resistance to radiation.  The selective pressure for this resistance wasn\u2019t clear, since there isn\u2019t really a naturally occurring environment on earth with these levels of radiation. One hypothesis was that a super robust system of ensuring DNA protection was also very protective against dehydration and desiccation, though I seem to recall Deinococcus itself wasn\u2019t particularly tolerant to those conditions.

People telling you \"well then don't publish then\" are missing the point, we're in a bit of a quagmire. Best I can say is that you can influence that process by focusing your reviewing on society-led journals that are not run for profit, or where the for-profit publisher shares money from publications with the society that runs the journal.

{"prompt": "CMV: Manufacturing is the fundamental driver of any economy. The more our manufacturing economy moves overseas, the more our 'information economy' will follow. Therefore, we should do everything possible to bring manufacturing of all kinds back to the United States. I feel like this view is often criticized as an overly simplistic view of how the economy works, almost childish. Still, I can't shake the sense of inherent truth in my title statement. Without belaboring the issue too much, I'll try to lay out my logic:  1. An economy is a market of material goods and services, fueled by material resources, knowledge and capital. 2. The United States has a lot of human capital and highly educated people. However, this human capital is linked to and was created in conjunction with industry (manufacturing of any kind): human capital is sustained by the manufacturing sector, and the manufacturing sector is sustained and advanced by human capital. 3. At the end of the day, the country and people who do the manufacturing will prevail, because the people involved with that manufacturing are developing and sustaining their own human capital associated with this manufacturing. 4. This new human capital will fuel schools, professional services, and an economy that will eventually supplant the need to import these services from other countries (like the United States). 5. That is why in the United States, we should be very worried about manufacturing increasingly moving overseas. Looking around at the room you're in (or just at the computer or phone you're using), where was it made? Sure, it may have been designed or even assembled here, but it's only a matter of time before other countries, like China, will take over all of those roles. 6. Once that happens, and other countries are entirely self-sufficient over the supply chain, what will we in this country have to offer as a good or service? If we can't offer anything or value, our economy will suffer.", "preferred": "Going one by one:  1) An economy is a market of material goods and services, fueled by material resources, knowledge and capital  Not all goods and services are material. Silicon valley is one of the wealthiest places in the world not because of factories, but because of the information economy.  2)  The United States has a lot of human capital and highly educated people. However, this human capital is linked to and was created in conjunction with industry (manufacturing of any kind): human capital is sustained by the manufacturing sector, and the manufacturing sector is sustained and advanced by human capital   Industries create resources for other industries, but they all eventually die. Most people used to be farmers, and now only a few percent of people work in agriculture. Automation and technology constantly change the necessary capacities for human labor. The importance of human capital to manufacturing is decreasing. We need fewer workers to get higher output.   3) At the end of the day, the country and people who do the manufacturing will prevail, because the people involved with that manufacturing are developing and sustaining their own human capital associated with this manufacturing   It isn't that manufacturing is unimportant, but it also isn't the only or even most important creator of capital.  4) This new human capital will fuel schools, professional services, and an economy that will eventually supplant the need to import these services from other countries (like the United States).   Advanced countries trade with others based on the concept of comparative advantage, not because they have to. It's more efficient. Many developing countries shoot themselves in the foot by forbidding or restricting certain international trade. Creating trade restrictions never has a net benefit on the economy, even if it protects certain industries. This is the point I feel most strongly about, as there is a wealth of evidence that trade is a massive benefit. This is supported by research into auto industry tariffs as well as economic models of comparative advantage such as the Hecksher Ohlin trade model.  5)  That is why in the United States, we should be very worried about manufacturing increasingly moving overseas.

They were hired in at the lower/\u201cstandard\u201d rate.  There are no formal job descriptions, but this individual does not have any additional operational responsibilities than the other 3. He wants to lower their pay to be in line with the other team members that hold the same position.  My boss is a bit unique - and perhaps a bit paranoid. In my opinion, he\u2019s made it out in his mind that this team member is a bad apple. He thinks they have a poor attitude and that it\u2019s affecting the rest of the team.  As the manager (and perhaps more of a \u201cpeople person\u201d than my boss) I can tell you this individual is an asset, and has no disciplinary action on file - but no performance reviews whatsoever, either. This team member is a straight-forward, \u201ccall it like you see it\u201d type. My boss does not like being questioned (granted the TM has never been disrespectful in the least) but I think he feels threatened by it.   I think his opinion of this team member is further soured by the fact he regrets their pay rate. I don\u2019t find it fair to lower their pay simply due to his personal opinion of them. Additionally, it\u2019s not their fault that they were hired at that rate.  I don\u2019t know how to combat this. My background is largely corporate, so I\u2019m really struggling navigating the small business world. He simply doesn\u2019t care that there isn\u2019t supporting documentation, that this team member hasn\u2019t caused any issue otherwise, or that its straight up ridiculous in my opinion to justify lowering someones pay without some large structural change, job title change, etc. (especially one that would somehow only affect 1 person?)  When I\u2019ve confronted him about it, he either just goes into a rant about things he doesn\u2019t like about this team member (nothing of substance) or changes the subject completely. My boss and I have a good work relationship and typically have a mutual respect of each others opinions, but when his mind is made up there\u2019s no changing it.  And if it ends up happening, I\u2019ll have to be the one to do it. I don\u2019t know how I will be able to reconcile it with myself. I don\u2019t even know how I\u2019ll begin to approach it.  Does anyone know any legality behind wage changes like that? We live in an employment-at-will state, so I feel like it might just be \u201canything goes\u201d. I\u2019m struggling to get his attention/get him to understand the affect this will have and I don\u2019t have anyone I can talk to about this.   Any advice or guidance is appreciated.    **TL;DR** - I manage a small team, my boss (privately owned small business owner) wants me to lower the rate of pay of a team member with no real reason other than he regrets hiring them at a higher starting pay. Struggling with the ethics (or legality) of having to do this.", "preferred": "I have a degree in HR and working HR experience. Is the pay rate competitive to the market for that type of role? I would suggest to the owner that the employee be \u201cred circled.\u201d If your boss feels the individual is paid more than the maximum of the pay range for that position at the company, discontinuing any increases would be red circling him. Then, at the next compensation increase meeting, you can inform the associate he won\u2019t be receiving an increase, because he is paid at the top of the range. If he moves to another position with a higher pay range, or until the max pay range for that job he\u2019s in increases, he will not receive increases. Instead of the \u201cgift that keeps on giving\u201d (i .e. an annual increase), you can consider giving him a one-time bonus at the annual comp review, to still reward him for his efforts. Annual salary would not change. This seems fair to me.   If the worker is indeed underperforming, that would be a different discussion, in that he isn\u2019t receiving an increase due to substandard work performance. You should provide examples and areas they need to improve in at the performance review. Documentation is key, as you already know. However, you clearly stated that it\u2019s not a performance issue.  I would strongly suggest NOT reducing his pay. Nowhere I have worked has this occurred, unless someone took a different job with different duties, as you stated. Reducing his pay would cause this individual to have an even poorer \u201cattitude that would affect the rest of the team.\u201d Use his words there. He was also given the position at that rate, per the offer letter; I would ask the owner what has changed between then and now? If it\u2019s that the company is trying to cut costs and save money, then eliminating positions or a reduction in force is where the company could save in administrative costs.", "rejected": "Since the other three team members have the same responsibilities and job title, why wouldn\u2019t they why shouldn\u2019t they confront the boss, as to why they are being paid less? The bosses failure to maintain/institute appropriate HR policies, and job descriptions, is his problem, not theirs. Explain to him this could come back to bite him, HARD. He needs to correct his lackadaisical approach to HR immediately, give raises to the other three employees, and count this as the price of a lesson he should have learned quite some time ago."}
{"prompt": "Middle-aged, burnout, hoping to leave academia Hello. I'm a researcher in a STEM field, formerly rather successful in terms of published papers, etc. Around three years ago I had a revelation that my research is nonsense: I'm publishing stuff that's peer reviewed by a clique, and read and applied by no one else.  I will be looking to move out of academia, but: (1) firstly I need to work my technical skills to be up-to-date with what industry wants; (2) I need to shed all the negative energy and bitterness that I amassed throughout these years.   So far (2) has been a real problem for me, partly due to being in my forties and never have worked outside of academia. I would really appreciate sharing positive stories and resources.", "preferred": "> my research is nonsense  > never have worked outside of academia  I'm not in STEM and I'm not middle-aged, but I have worked outside of academia and, based on that, I want to encourage you to temper your expectations of what life outside of academia is like. If you're burned out on your job, changing your job is definitely an avenue you should consider, but it's not your only avenue and I don't think that automatically privileging it is a good idea if it turns out that you're doing so out of overly rosy expectations.  There's a lot of bullshit in industry too. Working in the private sector (or public sector), being \"demand-driven\", being paid to provide a service to someone else doesn't necessarily mean that your work will be meaningful in some existential sense, nor that you will feel like it's meaningful. When I was in industry, a lot of my senior middle-aged colleagues said the same thing as you: I feel like a paper-pusher, nobody cares about what I do, I wish I were researching *the really important things* in academia/molding young minds. A lot of people were bitter, felt expoloited, felt like they were squandering their working years, and felt like the stuff they were producing (at an internationally renowned organization known to everyone in my field) work that has no impact on people's daily lives or which is a very expensive spinning-of-wheels. Everyone wasted 3 out of 5 days on emails and bullshit administrative tasks, everyone had shitty coworkers and unsupportive bosses, a lot of people were frustrated every day and hated their lives. This is not to discourage you from moving to industry. This is to encourage you to remember that the grass is greener where you water it.  Anyway, to get a little more woo-woo, I've been at institutions that everyone wants to be at starting in my mid-teens, and I am continually surprised by the one thing that unites my experience at all of these institutions: everyone around me bitched constantly. Brilliant people, living geniuses, people with an incredible work ethic and achievements to match, people with a level of privilege that I didn't know existed - they had something to complain about (like, a list as long as my arm of somethings) every single day. Some of these people have left industry for academia, or academia for industry, maybe even several times, and they are still constantly unhappy. I don't think they will ever be happy, because they've gotten everything they wanted several times in life and it's still not enough. Maybe I'm projecting too much of my experience on you, but burnt out + no experience of the outside world is a combination that I've seen way too many times to not notice the pattern. In my experience, a lot of the people who are very successful in academia have had such a rarefied life experience that they quite naturally find themselves above such mortal things as daily frustrations and a sense of worthlessness. But in the end, we are all lesser beings and finding solace in the fact that we must all eat, shit, sleep and respond to emails is a big part of any zen you want to achieve.

Let\u2019s say for example that if the IP address began with a 1 it was owned by America, and if it began with a 200 it was owned by Japan.   As the internet grew we really needed to shrink the amount of IP addresses each place was given as we were running out. We couldn\u2019t just rip everything up and start again though because that would have been a lot of work throughout the world.   So instead we chopped up the IP addresses into \u2018blocks\u2019. Now we could give anything that looks like  1.100.*.* to America and anything that looks like 1.200.*.* addresses could go to France where they were needed. At the time America was only using 1.100.*.* addresses so everything still worked the way it was without any issues.  The problem was, you couldn't tell that something beginning with a 1 now belonged to America, and we didn't want to keep updating this big list of 'where everything is' everytime we made a change.  So we created a subnet mask - this basically a set of instructions that says \u2018this is where we chop the IP address up into sections'.   You can see this at home - if you have an IP address of 192.168.0.100 and a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 - it means \u2018192.168.0.*\u2019 is here in the house, and anything outside of that is somewhere else, go and ask a router.  The internet routers know where everything in the world is (because we have all agreed on the subnet masks we will use in the world, and they have a big list of them).  If you want to try something fun at home, change the IP addresses that your house uses to something like 100.0.0.0 and set the subnet mask to 255.0.0.0. You'll find that the computers in your house think that the 100.*.*.* addresses are now \"here\" and you can no longer access large chunks of the internet because the computers are trying to find the internet inside your house, instead of where it belongs."}

{"prompt": "has anyone created a philosophy based around narcissism?", "preferred": "I think this really depends on the definition of narcissism you're using. I'm a psychotherapist and know that even in this camp it has different meanings in different contexts, and of course it has less rigid definitions colloquially. Building a philosophy *around* narcissism doesn't seem like something a narcissist would do, as it diminishes the unique excellence of the narcissist into a philosophy that others can adopt (presumably enhancing *their* narcissism, which is a threat to other narcissists). It *could* happen, I just don't see it as likely.  As much as I personally dislike Ayn Rand (and like Max Stirner), neither Objectivism nor Stirner's egoism are necessarily narcissistic. Rand's personal issues aside, Objectivism rejects many of the elements of vanity and prestige that lie at the heart of NPD, and it rejects the equation of self-esteem with a lack of empathy. Likewise, Stirner was promoting an anti-capitalist \"Union of Egoists\", not some world of which he was the center. He understood the project of socialism as in his interests, so I understand the practical side (rather than the Diogenes-like Cynicism) of his egoism in a similar sense to Oscar Wilde's \"*The Soul of Man Under Socialism*\", where true individuality, true Individualism, is only possible after the slavery of capitalism is overthrown.  I can't speak to other candidates here. I don't think solipsism *means* narcissism in the sense I guess you're using it as one can be a Cartesian brain in a vat who believes the whole world is a tormenting illusion. A negative narcissism to be sure, but probably not what most would think about when you say \"narcissism\".", "rejected": "While adherents would probably oppose the term \"narcissism\" because it has built in negative biases and connotations, there are a couple I know of:  1. Objectivism. (Ayn Rand)  2. Yangism in ancient China. (Yang Zhu)  3. Some forms of hedonism might also qualify, particularly those developed by the Cyrenaics.  Unfortunately, few (if any) of the works from 2 and 3 exist anymore. We have only secondhand accounts, like the Mengzi, where I first came across it:  *\"What Yang Zhu was for was self. If by plucking one hair he might benefit the whole world, he would not do it.\"*  \u2014\u2009Mencius on Yang Zhu, Mengzi  Personally, I would say utilitarianism is narcissistic and cannot be otherwise. While utilitarianism may not be motivated by narcissism, it can only be applied using narcissism."}
{"prompt": "[Harry Potter] We've seen a quintessential Gryffindor hero in Harry. What would a quintessential hero from the other houses be like?", "preferred": "Honestly I'd argue Luna Lovegood is a good example of a Ravenclaw hero, but that's because I think to be a good representative of your house you need to encompass both the pros and the cons.  Harry is a hero to a fault. He constantly gets in trouble and protects the weak while forgetting to take care of himself. He'll put the mask over someone else's face and choke to death. That doesn't make him smart or perfect, but it does make him a Gryffindor.   Luna is curious to a fault. She's completely convinced there's more to Earth than people say there is, and that alienates her from people who are more grounded and less skeptical than she is. While a lot of what she thinks is not accurate, she never makes a huge fuss about it, and updates her knowledge whenever shown to be wrong. Her curiosity and eagerness to learn is ultimately what makes her a very powerful witch, and gives her the extremely random, yet crucial knowledge that helps Harry when he needs it the most.   As for Hufflepuff, someone else already said Newt Scamander, but I'd argue for Cedric as well? If Hufflepuff is about compassion, in the little we saw of him Cedric always went out of his way to help his enemies and make sure others had a fair shot at everything. Guy was down to Earth, never picked on anyone and didn't let his talents define him as much as his personhood. He took a shot for someone else and yet the first thing his spirit asked Harry was to please care for his father by bringing him his body -- while that might be a clich\u00e9, it also *is* Cedric. He's the ultimate cool dork.   As far as Slytherin I mean....... lol. Lmao. Heroes.  I guess Snape.", "rejected": "A good example of a Ravenclaw would be someone who doesn't convene to social norms but is willing to use their intellect for good, such as helping others understand difficult concepts or solving problems for others. Good example is Luna Lovegood.  A good example of a Slytherin is, while sneaking and cunning, fiercely loyal to their friends to the end and willing to go all the way to help them. They can also cultivate connections and can charm people with ease, which they use for gathering information. Good example is Horace Slughorn."}
{"prompt": "How long did it take you to get hired after graduating? I just graduated in May and I am currently struggling to find a job. I've applied to thousands of jobs and only gotten 3 responses back.

I didn't apply anywhere until I passed my FE exam.  Seriously.  Pass it.  I passed it in March, then slapped it on my resume.  2.  I didn't apply anywhere until I got it reviewed by r/EngineeringResumes, my career advisor, and a seasoned professional alumni from my university.  Revised and cleaned up a ton.  3.  I decided which industries I wanted to focus on, then wrote up a cover letter for each- telling my story and showing just how excited I was to join that industry.   4.  I networked like crazy.  My cousin helped introduce me to engineers she knew, and the vast majority of my job opportunities were through her relationships.  The world is all about who you know, and if you don't know people, you're going to suffer.  4.  I sent applications and cover letters out to everyone.  (This was around early April)  5.  No responses for 2 weeks. Continued looking out for networking opportunities.  Cleaned up LinkedIn profile based on videos.  Put up \"Open to work\".  Recruiters started reaching out.  6. Pursued any and every opportunity put before me by recruiters- if only for the interview practice.  And boy was it great practice AND networking opportunities.   7.  Interview interview interview back to back for like 2 weeks.  8. First offer comes in.  Use it as leverage on other companies interviewed with. Offers come in and further leverage is used.  Sync up deadline for all offers on same day (give yourself a week- you will thank me for it)  9.  Do an offer evaluation with your career advisor and go over all (or as many as possible) a few days before deadline.   10. Accept job offer and enjoy the new gig!", "rejected": "I had two offers a year before graduation.  Just made sure to list my personal and school projects since I didn't have much formal work experience."}

Would you rather own a Prius owned by a 16 year old or a Versa owned by an 80 year old? Find a mechanic, pay them to do a 100+ point inspection (and make sure they actually do it, it shouldn't cost more than half an hours labor) and then decide what you like the best, what is in your price range, and cost-of-ownership in the time frame your looking to own each car for. Don't trust the dealerships mechanic. Not saying there bad, just saying they can miss things that can cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars. It's an investment, get a 2nd opinion.

To the first point, while I understand how difficult it can be to find reviewers, I also have huge reservations about editors making unilateral decisions regarding the subjective \"quality\" or \"interest\" of manuscripts dealing with subjects that they may not  themselves be expert in.   To the second, a desk reject for me is an annoyance; a desk reject for a graduate student with few papers who is struggling to build a publication record is a far more serious affair.  My question is, do you think desk rejects are the best practice, given the volume of submissions that many journals receive?"}

Please forgive me if this is the wrong space to post this. I finished my MA degree a few years ago, and I have been doing work unrelated to my degree since. Today my former second reader professor forwarded me a call for papers for a special conference about a very specific niche, on which I wrote my MA thesis. I really want to be a part of this conference, but I only submitted and presented papers while I was a student, and I no longer belong to an organization or school. Is it allowed for a regular \"no-longer-a-student\" person to participate? Will they welcome my submission?

{"prompt": "how do I prove the chair exists so, today is my first day in my final grade, and it's my first time with philosophy, and my teacher just said, \"prove to me that this chair exists\" I told him: if I interact with it by touching it and my body contacts its atoms then it exists then he said some dumb joke and made it homework to prove that the chair exists andddd here I am after 2 hours of research I question everything and still don't know if that chair exists. help I'm in existential dreed I need to know how to prove that the chair exists", "preferred": "The point is indeed for you to despair at not finding any easy or obvious way to prove something that you normally think obvious. It's to show you that you don't know what you thought you knew.  Part of the issue is that you're not clear on the question. Your teacher didn't specify what kind of existence, and really you don't know what existence is anyway, so you're not clear on what it would mean to count as existing. Practically you can prove the chair is there because you and everyone else can see it. If your teacher demands more, you can prove it by asking your teacher to sit on it, and then try to sit without it. If they need yet more evidence, you can say that if the chair isn't existent then they should not mind you striking it hard against their desk; it shouldn't harm anything since it isn't existent. The \"if this isn't existent and real, then...\" kind of argument forces anyone denying it is there to bite a bullet on an outcome that will be very unpleasant if it is indeed real, and which can be proven by the unpleasant or nonexistent consequence if there really is a question.  Unless your teacher's point is to force you to question external existence itself, this is rather trivial and requires no immediate appeal to faith in an objective world.", "rejected": "I mean, you can\u2019t prove, in any strict sense, that the chair exists. At least I don\u2019t think you can.  Most philosophers (81% per the PhilPapers survey) still support realism about the external world. It seems like the most reasonable explanation for our sensory experience is that the objects of that experience really exist. But, yknow, there can always be an evil demon deceiving you. You could be in the matrix. We can\u2019t prove there\u2019s a chair."}
{"prompt": "I honked my horn at a red light to alert a pedestrian in a crosswalk about oncoming traffic. The car in front of me thought I honked at them and drove into the car in front of them. Now wants to sue me or file a claim with my insurance. Do I have anything to worry about? Tennessee.  I'm trying to figure out if I have some fault in this situation and need to worry about an insurance claim/being sued. I was driving in town today, and I stopped at a red light, 3-4 cars from the front. I was stopped directly behind a crosswalk (not a crosswalk at an intersection, and it does not have the cross/no cross light). While I was waiting, a woman pushing a stroller came from my right and started into the crosswalk in front of my car. I noticed she wasn't paying attention to the traffic in the other lane traveling opposite of me (like if I was facing north, the other traffic is going south) and I saw a large pickup truck coming really quickly in the S bound lane. She was going to walk straight into the road into the path of the truck because she wasn't paying attention or trying to check that side of the road, so I honked my horn quickly to get her attention while I was rolling my window down to try to tell her to stop. When I honked my horn, the woman in the car in front of me suddenly hit her gas and slammed into the back of the car in front of her. I guess she wasn't paying attention to the light or the road and thought I was honking at her, so she just took off without looking up. I pulled over to a parking spot on the street because I felt like I was involved at this point. The woman with the stroller also stayed behind because she saw it happen, and she wanted to thank me because she realized what would've happened if she'd walked into the road. The police came and took a report from all of us, they checked my license and got my information/insurance. They wrote a ticket to the woman in the car in front of me (I don't know the exact charge/statute) and told me they'd be in contact with me if needed but that there's basically no reason they'd need to get ahold of me again. Told me I was free to go if I wanted. After the police left, I got in my car and the woman in the car in front of me basically ran up to my driver window and started demanding that I also give *her* a copy of my license and insurance. I told her that I was definitely not doing that, to step away from my car, and I was leaving. She started to scream about suing me, so I rolled my window up and backed out around her and left.  I'm really not too worried about being sued because I'm pretty confident that when I show up and give my side, it's going to end in my favor. Am I wrong about that? I know about needing to show up if she does sue me. Mostly, is there any way that she can get my insurance/license information from the police report and try to start a claim with my car insurance? If she does this, does it sound like I have any liability here? If I don't, can my insurance costs still go up just because she files a bogus report? And did I handle this situation correctly?  Any information/advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks all.", "preferred": "If you are sued respond to the lawsuit.  Also, bring popcorn because it's gonna be a fireworks show when this yoyo tells a judge that this is your fault.", "rejected": "I'll bet you a dollar she was texting."}
{"prompt": "I am correct in understanding that it would be practically impossible to get a job if I had a 6-9 year gap after graduation?

{"prompt": "What products do Chinese manufacturers produce with equal or higher quality than US manufacturers? We often hear about poor quality of Chinese manufacturing.  Are there any products they produce to higher quality standards than the US? (ie, better design, materials, manufacturing techniques, etc.)", "preferred": "Books.  At my work we joke that it's because all of the good adhesives have been banned in the US, but any time we get anything bound in the US, the quality is lacking, but the Chinese printers always make excellent products.", "rejected": "There is more buyer bewareness necessary in many Chinese goods. When I buy materials and parts, I generally have three priorities: price, lead time, and quality. 20 years ago, results could be fantastic or chaotic. Now, I find many Chinese goods that embarrass the nearest north American competitors. This is an unpopular stance even now, but the US and Canada are no longer the workshop for our own goods, let alone the world. The exceptions are in military and health care product manufacturing. Few American manufacturers will even return inquiries if the work falls out of these categories.   As for growth, wages are going down in American manufacturing as a percentage of cash turnover. In short, the management drives $60k cars, the workers are driving increasingly dilapidated rust buckets. These trends are accelerating. Many try and spin this differently, but the facts say otherwise. Many manufacturing skill sets and core competencies have left the country and are not coming back. More manufacturing consists of managing the logistics of foreign vedors.   As a result, I see a lot more chaos in quality control and costs with American products that were once commodities and are now specialty items domestically than with Chinese products."}
{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old: Why is it that not wearing a seat belt is unsafe and illegal, yet most (U.S.) school buses aren't even equipped with them?", "preferred": "School busses are designed in a compartmentalized fashion, that is the seats are close together with high backs, which keeps passengers relatively restrained in a crash, even without seatbelts. The NHTSA has spent a fortune studying this, and has found that adding seatbelts doesn't increase the safety of school busses enough to warrant a full refurbishment or re-design of busses.  School busses also have a much lower center of gravity, so in a crash with a normal vehicle, the passengers are much higher up, and less likely to be affected by any damage. Of course, this doesn't take into account rollovers of busses, which is thankfully pretty rare, also because of the design.  You also have to take into account to the young age of children who are on the bus. Enforcing the seatbelts would be impractical, but even worse, many younger children may struggle to get themselves out of the belt in the rare event of a serious crash, meaning they are unable to escape through an emergency exit without additional help.  There is only an average of 6-10 deaths of school children in school busses each year, and while that's tragic, it would be impossible to get that number to 0, even with seat belts. Statistically, school busses are 70% safer than a car in terms of getting your child to/from school, and full-size busses are literally the safest vehicles on the road.  It should be mentioned that smaller busses do have, and are supposed to require, seatbelt use in most places in the US.", "rejected": "Seatbelts protect you in the event of a sudden change in speed (like going from \"driving\" to \"stopped\" in a split second when your car smashes into something).  Buses are *so massive* that this simply isn't as much of an issue - if a bus hits something, it's not going to instantly go from \"driving\" to \"crashed\", it's *just going to keep going*.  This means the people in the bus will experience much, much less force."}
{"prompt": "[TX] Employee upset because written request was responded to verbally - how to move forward?

Now the employee is upset they weren't emailed back and I am looking for advice on if we should email back recapping the verbal conversation or just continue the conversations verbally and keep it out of email.", "preferred": "Why would you not send the response via email?  While I understand the want to keep things informally, if the employee requested a response via email, why are you not okay with that? I question why employers cannot put responses in writing if they are not doing anything wrong.  I work in a very transparent organization so I question why you would not put something in writing and tie it back to policy to protect the organization.", "rejected": "Flip the script.   If something happens you have no way to prove that you addressed their concerns.   Personally, I\u2019ve always felt that a response in the same manner as the inquiry is the \u201cright\u201d way to do it, regardless of what\u2019s legally required.   Heck, on sensitive topics even verbal exchanges, unless you\u2019re shady, a \u201cper our conversation\u201d recap is typically good practice."}

{"prompt": "CMV: Even though I'm liberal, since I live in a red state and county I should register as Republican to have a say in political elections via primaries. If the Tea Party has shown anything it's that a small portion of a political party can have a large impact on national elections because they can sway primaries in areas either deep in the Red or gerrymandered to ensure it.  I've been an liberal and have pretty much registered and voted as a Democrat. For the longest time, I've said quite honestly that my vote does not count in Presidential elections due to my state. While I disagree with the Electoral College it is the nature of the system for some time to come. However, it also means I have no say in how elections turn out. I can vote Blue every year yet it'll be a Red senator, representative, governor, county sheriff, dog catcher, etc. that's getting picked in November.   Having seen that in situations like myself, primaries are where its at. However, if I register Democrat, I only can vote in Democratic primaries. To me, it seems reasonable that if thousands in my area instead banded together and registered as Republicans when can have a controlling vote in who at least is the Republican candidate.

{"prompt": "Do you use physics formulas in your daily life and how has it improved your life? Any example would be appreciated.", "preferred": "I'm going to write a drawn-out non-answer to your question with a disappointing answer at the end.  Contrary to the impression that many students may get from physics education, formula are not at all what physics is about. They are merely a convenient way of expressing relations that reflect the underlying concepts, and these concepts are the really important thing.  My life - and that of most people I know - is significantly improved thanks to technology that relies heavily on physics. Also, doing physics allows me to have an incredibly rewarding job.  This of course involves a lot of math, and while I certainly like that part very much it's not what its fundamentally about.  I don't think either of these are what you mean though.  Everybody uses basic physical intuition all the time, for things like judging the appropriate amount of force to apply when lifting an object, opening a door, or hugging people. Most of the time this intuition works well enough that you don't need to do any explicit calculations.  Everyday uses of slightly more advanced physics includes checking if the remote works using the phone's camera which is sensitive to IR and thus shows a bright spot when the remote is active that you can't see with the unaided eye. This involves knowledge about physical concepts referred to in my first paragraph, but not any formula.  To the question: I can't think any example where I explicitly use physics formula outside either work, school, or hobby physics.  Edit: I just thought about a possible example; when standing on a crowded bus or train, knowing how apparent forces work in non-inertial systems lets me know ahead of time which way to lean to keep stable when the vehicle is turning, braking or accelerating.", "rejected": "It's heating season, so Q' = (1/R) A deltaT comes up a lot.

I am Doctor Mark Horowitz MBBS PhD, and I am a psychiatric researcher in the National Health Service in England, an honorary researcher at University College London and training psychiatrist. My research has been concerned with how to safely stop psychiatric medications based on understanding their effects on the brain - and the technique I have developed, called hyperbolic tapering30032-X/fulltext), has been adopted as guidance for the public by the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the UK. This research came out of my own awful experience coming off antidepressants. I run a clinic in the public health service in London to help people safely stop psychiatric drugs for anxiety and depression and find that many people who could not stop their medication in the 'old-fashioned' ways are able to do so safely in my clinic, now supported by studies using similar techniques.  I am also a co-author of the recent umbrella review assessing the validity of the serotonin hypothesis ('chemical imbalance') in depression, published in Molecular Psychiatry. While many psychiatrists say this is old news, research suggests that over 80% of the public still believe in the chemical imbalance theory, and many companies and healthcare bodies still promote it on their websites.  In North America, I have co-founded a company called Outro Health, which brings this gradual, supported and hyperbolic approach to people in Canada and the US, so that people will have the support they need (and which I did not have!).

{"prompt": "CMV: Abortion is almost always morally acceptable In order to elaborate my view, I have to explain how my principles and morality affect my take. First off, I think there's a distinct difference between something being \"alive\", and something being alive AND worthy of being seen as equal to humans/animals and such (I'll get back to this). I also don't see the potential of life equally important as something already being alive. I am also a very pragmatic person despite my principles, which I think influences my view alot.   There are many things we consider \"alive\" that we don't care for, such as plants. We cut grass for aesthetic purposes with no regard for the grass. What most people would probably say is \"Well grass can't feel pain.\" And I agree, the fact that grass can't feel pain is one HUGE factor in deciding whether or not we should protect it from death. Now I'm getting to the point I made earlier about differentiating different types of being alive. A fetus won't develop the necessary components to experience pain until at least 24-25 weeks. The fact that an abortion before this time period would not cause the fetus any pain at all, makes it comparable to plants for me. It doesn't have any conscious experiences, nor any memories that will fade away (fetal memory has only been found around 30 weeks after conception).   There's one more component to my view I'd like to elaborate on, and that is the parenting. Fetuses can't socialize, which means they won't have any relationships with other people. If this was the case, then aborting said fetus would also affect the people having a relationship with them. The only people having any type of reasonable relationship with the fetuses, are the parents. They obviously created this fetus. That's why I think the only people deserving of choosing whether to abort or not, should be the parents.  I'd also like to say that if the mother's life is at risk, she should be able to choose if she wants to save the fetus or herself (and she shouldn't be looked down on for saving her own life). If someone held you at gunpoint and told you to choose whether or not to shoot you or another person, I think it's self defence, and not necessarily morally wrong to let the other person die.  So to summarize, I think abortion is morally acceptable before 24 weeks, in the case of a rape, and if the mother's life is at risk. But it's arguable after 24 weeks (due to the possibility of experiencing pain).", "preferred": "You already contradicted yourself in your first paragraph.  \\>there's a distinct difference between something being \"alive\", and something being alive AND worthy of being seen as equal to humans  \\> I also don't see the potential of life equally important as something already being alive.  These two things are at odds.  Are you accepting that human life begins at conception, or are you calling the earliest stages of the human life cycle only \"potential of life\"?  Also, whether something is alive AND worthy of being seen as equal to humans would be a moot point in this case since we're discussing an organism that is literally human and alive (homo sapiens).  \\>The fact that an abortion before this time period would not cause the fetus any pain at all, makes it comparable to plants for me. It doesn't have any conscious experiences, nor any memories that will fade away (fetal memory has only been found around 30 weeks after conception).

Your moral viewpoint allows for someone to murder you in your sleep.", "rejected": "The problem is that your ethical parameters lack a sufficient limiting principle to withstand universalization.

{"prompt": "Can I let my beef stew sit overnight? I'm making a rather simpel italian beef stew. Normally it was for saturday, but due to scheduling conflicts i'm hosting on friday. Because i'm not getting home untill just an hour before the guest arrive and I know that letting some stews sit overnight are just more delicous i'm wondering if I can do this with this as well.   Usually i'll start in the morning for this dish, but I just want to doublecheck. Any added tips are obviously appreciated.    **The recipe:**   beef 2.5 k, 2 red peppers, 1 onion, 2 garlic cloves, 440g tomato pieces (can), 2 tbsp  tomato paste     4 dl  beef stock, 3dl Red wine, 3 tbsp olive oil, basil,  rosemary (dried), marjoram (dried). I'm still contemplating in using white win instead of red. Because i've been told that it pushes the flavor of the beef and adding pancetta and some carrots.    Recipe is rather simple.  Place flour in a sealable plastic bag. Season with salt and pepper. Add beef and shake to coat.  Sear the sides of the beef. Put the vegetables in the pot and braise them. Then add the beef with all the liquids. Apply light heat to let them simmer for a good 2 hours.

People in line tend to respect 6 feet apart from each other, and most are wearing masks. However, once inside, the aisles are so compact that it's been impossible not to be very close to people for the most part.  \\- Most things have been in stock, but all kinds of flour are generally scarce.  \\- Farmers Markets are still going!

{"prompt": "How to stay sustainable while baking? I could find a similar thread here, but maybe I just didn't look hard enough. I love baking, but I feel kind of guilty when I bake too much. Heating up the oven uses a lot of energy, cleaning up afterwards uses lots of water, and sometimes I need to use animal products or one-use equipment such as parchment paper. I'd love to bake more and improve as a baker, but my impact on the environment prevents me from doing so. The question is - how can I be more sustainable while baking (and working in the kitchen in general)? Give me every tip you have.  Personally I try to use reusable parchment paper or re-use regular one until it gets too dirty, and I try to bake a few things at a time when it's possible.

Also try to find a bulk food store that you can bring your own containers to refill (this may not be an option currently, but it will be again at some point).

{"prompt": "CMV: I'm just not getting the controversy around the possibility of defunding Planned Parenthood I don't disagree with anything PP does, or think they aren't providing an essential service.  What I don't get is the logic that any company that provides an essential service should be funded by the government. Aren't there literally thousands of companies providing essential services that don't get funded by the government?  Just a super simple example. Toothpaste. Toothpaste is an essential product, and as far as I know there isn't a company producing it that gets funded by the government. If the government did fund them, it could be sold at a much lower cost. Why isn't there outrage over the government not funding toothpaste companies?  It's the general logic I don't understand. If one feels that PP is an essential service, and thus should be paid for with taxpayer dollars, why would this begin and end with just PP? Shouldn't there be a list containing hundreds of essential products and services that should all be funded by the government too? What about charities, why aren't they important too?

The Hyde Amendment prevents taxpayer funds from being used to fund abortions unless the mothers life is at risk or in cases of rape or incest. Some of the hardliners in Congress do care about them providing abortions, but they are few and far between. Planned Parenthood's real \"sin\" is the aggressive lobbying they do against Republican candidates to the tune of 10s of millions of dollars. The real goal is to decrease their notoriety and reach through defunding. Whether or not you believe they should be defunded likely comes down to whether you hold liberal or conservative views, its simply a partisan issue.   Also, the money they receive is not \"free money\" gifted to them, its medicaid and Title IX money they get for performing medical services on poor patients, its not a government handout. The government is subsidizing poor peoples healthcare by paying for their treatment at Planned Parenthood. If that same poor person were to go to another clinic other than Planned Parenthood, the government would still be on the hook for the bill incurred, so the money is being spent either way; its simply a preference of where the government wants that money spent.

{"prompt": "If salt raises the boiling temp of water, is there additive that will let water freeze at a higher temp also?", "preferred": "Sort of, but not really. Most scientists think there isn't anything (solute) you can add to water to raise its freezing point above 0C.  Water is made up from and one oxygen nucleus bonded to two hydrogen nucleus. By adding neutrons to any of the nucleuses you increase the weight of water, but it's still fundamentally water - it will act pretty much the same. However, one exception is that because the water is heavier, it has a higher freezing point. Heavy water freezes at 3.8C. Heavy water is made from oxygen and two deuterium nucleuses (a hydrogen nucleus with one neutron added). So you've added something, but not in a chemical way - like adding salt.", "rejected": "Great question! What you're touching on here are actually the properties of mixtures.   As many are saying, pure water will always freeze at 0C and most *solvents* will lower that freezing point. But what about other liquids?  When you mix two liquids together, you often end up with a liquid that has properties (BP, FP, vapor pressure, etc.) That are in between the values of the pure components. Now mind you that the effect is *not* a linear dependency on concentration (most mixtures are nonideal). So, in theory, if you added a liquid which freezes at a higher temperature than water, you might end up with a mixture that does also.  Now it is important to note that there are not many things that have this property that are miscible with water. Hydrocarbons of course freeze at high temperatures but they are not miscible. Same with non ionic metals. Waters hydrogen bonding makes it one of the least volatile aqueous solutions. Maybe DMSO water mixtures? Although density would likely drive separation there.   Maybe a colloidal suspension of oil in water like lotion? What is the freezing point of lotion? With colloids you begin to lose some of the lines between solid and liquid to things like gel phases.

His goal was to go against psychologists of his time. (Sadly I don't think he names them)  I think Piaget's \"psychology of intelligence\" is a real attack on Kantian theory. And he often attacks Vienna circle too. But honestly, this book was too hard for me to understand it.Also in modern psychology \"cognitive bias\" is an interesting subject since it often uses \"logic\" to say what is wrong in our reasoning... I can't put it in words clearly but i think these psychologists are not much aware of the question of \"apriori truth\" and could be an interesting case study.  I've read in Stanford encyclopedia that Popper said that math could be aposteriori. But i can't find the source sorry. But the idea could apply to logic maybe.  But i'd finish with my nominalist interpretation of Aristotle. Who seems to say that the law of logic depends on language and not external reality. So you must put these laws before being able to speak. (thus necerly aprioiri?).  I think wittgenstein's 3.032:\"to present in language anything which \"contradicts logic\" is as impossible as in geometry to present by its coordinates a figure which contradicts the law of space.\" Goes in that direction."}
{"prompt": "Infant girl three weeks of age has had two choking incidents , one of which made her spend her first Christmas in hospital. Bit of a heavy one here, but I NEED advice. (Also sorry for the spelling and grammar I\u2019m not the smartest when it comes to that stuff.)  So on the first of December I gave birth to the most beautiful baby girl. She weighed 6lbs 2oz and was the picture of health and happiness. Everything was going perfect until the end of her first week of life , I looked down at her and she was red and wide eyed and flopping her head around in distress... I realised she was choking, I scooped her up and when she was up right and had a few sharp blast to the back vomit started to come out of her nose and mouth, she started crying when the vomit started gushing so I knew that she could breath again. Now this whole incident only last in total 5-8 seconds, but it really shook me. After she was better I was so relieved but I was immediately worried it was going to happen again so I asked my partner/ mum/ partners mum and dad/ friends who are parents / doctors/ midwife/ health visitor and they all pretty much told me it would be fine and she would have cleared it herself if had of been asleep or not watching her because \u2018that\u2019s how babies are designed \u2018 , but they didn\u2019t see it , they didn\u2019t see the fear in her eyes and how she was acting. It was honestly so frustrating to not be listened to or taken seriously about this of all things. Nevertheless even though it went against what I believed, I listened to them and settled myself and made myself chalk it down as a freak accident and told myself that she would have been fine if I hadn\u2019t of helped her.  Fast forward to Christmas Eve and me and my partner where just about to go to sleep, I was actually already drifting off and he screams she not breathing, it was happening again but this time it was way worse , she was wide eyed again and flopping about in distress but this time when she was sat up and patted on the back nothing was happening and she started moving a lot less and her eyes closed, she was starting to turn purple, basically she was about to choke to death. Thankfully after the last time I watched some infant first aid videos, so i asked my partner to hold her head down and I opened her mouth and stuck my finger in and hooked the thick liquid stuff that was in the throat and started pulling it out, she let of one little tiny cry so I knew it was working to some degree so I ran into the kitchen and got the mucus sucker and with one hand used it on her nose and the other hand to hook the stuff out of her throat again . Finally she cried a few times and began to breath and even though she was foaming at the mouth and very weak I could tell she was atleast breathing again , this whole incident last 40 seconds. Once we got her breathing again we called an ambulance, they took her in to hospital and observed her for a while and advised on some changes in food (both the amount and type) and said she should be fine.  Now here\u2019s my problem, everyone said she was fine the first time too, but clearly it happened again and to a much worse degree!  Now me and my partner are taking full shifts so she is always with someone who is awake and fully alert, which is fine but I can\u2019t relax, I spent eight hours solidly just staring at her watching her breathing and panicking every time she moved or made a noise. I genuinely don\u2019t know how I am meant to cope with this fear that she is going to die any second, I can\u2019t enjoy any time with her because I\u2019m so stressed even though I want to be able to enjoy being with her I just can\u2019t over the past few days.

{"prompt": "Our 3 (?) year old rescue dog has some major behavioral issues, and we are at a loss. This is going to be somewhat of a long read, but please help. We don\u2019t know what to do.   My husband and I adopted our dog, Bear, from a local shelter about 4 months ago. The shelter told us he\u2019s a lab mixed with possible jack russel. He basically looks like a miniature black lab (he\u2019s 40 pounds). They guessed is age is around 3, but no one really knows for sure. He was rescued from Puerto Rico where he was homeless and running the streets eating out of trash cans. Our friend that is from Puerto Rico, and has family there, told us that there is a homeless dog epidemic there. They\u2019re everywhere. Along with that, the citizens aren\u2019t very nice to them as they throw trash and other objects at them and basically abuse them all together.   So, our dog has some major behavioral issues. We believe he has some extreme anxiety and possible PTSD (he was down there when they got hit with those terrible hurricanes years ago, on top of not knowing what all he experienced in those 3 years of being down there). He used to be terrified of the outdoors all together, but he got over that as he\u2019s okay in big open yards now.  But he is still traumatized by parking lots and any movement outside (cars, bikes, people walking towards him, etc.). He will cower and refuse to move, try to back out of his harness and attempt to bolt under cars or back into our apartment building whenever we are walking him. When he does walk he drags us and wheezes the entire time and is frantically looking for an escape route. Taking him outside is the hardest and most frustrating thing to do. There\u2019s been many times where he refuses to go potty outside after we\u2019ve tried for over an hour. We\u2019ll bring him inside to give him a break and try again later, and he\u2019ll run off somewhere and do his business inside our apartment. He doesn\u2019t always do this, but it\u2019s been around 5 times since we\u2019ve had him.   Bear loves people and is one of the sweetest and even tempered dogs I\u2019ve ever met. He just chills every day all day, doesn\u2019t really play, rarely barks, loves attention. Everyone that meets him wants to keep him lol. But he has aggressive tendencies with other dogs. I have found this issue out by bringing him to work with me. I work at a dog boarding and daycare facility. I\u2019ve brought him a few times to see if socializing him outside would help him with his anxiety of the outdoors along with trying to get him to play, but it\u2019s just brought out another issue. His problem mostly seems to be dogs that are his size or bigger, but if smaller dogs push it too far he will go after them too. If they sniff for too long or in the wrong area, and sometimes just a quick one, he will show his teeth and growl.  If a dog tries to play with him or jump on him, same thing, but then he\u2019ll snap at them. Sometimes them just standing near him not doing anything will set him off. He\u2019s very on edge the entire time and you have to monitor him closely with other dogs.   Something happened today that was kinda my breaking point. I brought him to work and put him in the yard with the little dogs. I went outside to check on them later and they all surrounded me and were jumping up on me. One of the dogs (about the same size as mine) jumped on him and my dog snapped at him. He grabbed him by his neck with his teeth and tried flinging him side to side. This caused a few other dogs to start fighting because of the stress and the environment. I was mortified.   Luckily no one got hurt and I immediately separated them. I\u2019ve decided to not bring him anymore until we can get his issues figured out. I can\u2019t be having my own dog causing issues and hurting others at my job. Along with that, whenever I am not outside with my dog at work all he does is whines and cries. I don\u2019t think this is the right environment for him, but I also feel like he needs to socialize with other dogs and lose his aggressive tendencies.   We just don\u2019t know what to do anymore. We\u2019ve told our vet and all he did was put him on some anxiety medication and sent us on our way. He didn\u2019t seem to really listen to us. He\u2019s been on the medication for 3 months and there\u2019s been no change. We\u2019ve tried training him but he doesn\u2019t listen at all. Nothing motivates him- he won\u2019t eat or drink outside of his food bowl at home. This includes treats, so that method doesn\u2019t work during training. We try to praise him and pet him when he listens, but that doesn\u2019t even seem to work because he doesn\u2019t learn.   When I get animals I am in it for the long haul. I work through any issues that they have and overcome them. But he is so hard and exhausting. Taking him outside is a nightmare, trying to socialize him is scary, trying to get him to play is a dead end, trying to get him to eat and drink outside of our apartment is impossible. My husband is even more frustrated and brought up the line \u201cmaybe he\u2019ll be better elsewhere because he doesn\u2019t seem happy here..\u201d  It would break my heart to get rid of him because he really is such a good and sweet dog that we\u2019ve both bonded with, along with our cat (they\u2019re best friends lol). He just has some issues that need worked through. We don\u2019t know what else to do. This is why I\u2019m reaching out- to see if any of you can lend a helping hand. It would mean the world to us.

He'd need constant training for years. It's similar to a human who has gone through a very serious experience since birth. For a human, it's very very hard and requires years of therapy and medication, and a human can be reasoned with. A dog doesn't even understand that he has an issue or that you are trying to help him. Also, there's epigenetics to consider since he's from Purto Rico.   I recommend giving up on trying to make him normal and work on living with his disorder. He can live a happy life without being \"normal\", but you'll need to make accommodations.  Also, if you give him up, he'll most likely be euthanized."}

Researchers are constantly re-classifying and labeling 'subsets' based on different cellular markers and gene expression profiles, but most likey these cells exist on a spectrum more than in discrete categories. That being said, while the overall memory population in the T and B cell compartments are being reduced, we don't know which one of these subsets may be preferentially targeted. For instance, this paper (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/22952446/) observes reductions in memory B cell populations, but doesn't report on plasma cells, which are also a type of memory cell of B cell lineage that pump out tons of antibodies and are generated from vaccine inoculations. Autoimmune B and T cells, even as memory, are also of a different flavor from their normal counterparts, and we don't know if MV could be killing them randomly, selectively, or not at all. MV depends not only on target specificity but also what cellular machinery it has at its disposal, which entirely relies on the gene signature of a particular cell.  Finally, using MV may actually reactivate autoimmune and cancerous lymphocytes, due to massive activation of anti-viral genetic programs that lead to secretion of inflammatory factors such as interferons, which can activate autoimmune cells and improve survival of cancerous lymphocytes. Since MV isn't sequestered to any particular organ/tissue site, such global anti-viral activation might do more harm than good.", "rejected": "Given that there is now a state of emergency declared in the State of Washington due to measles outbreaks, should adults who were vaccinated fro measles as children get re-vaccinated?

{"prompt": "make me feel better - tell me your overseas manufacturing horror stories I work for a US consumer goods company. We make plastic injection molded stuff. Due to relentless cost pressures from retailers we manufacture in China. We work with four main factories and they're all so, so horrible. I'm sure there are great factories in China, but we can't afford them. Anyone with their shit together is undoubtedly out of our price range.   &#x200B;  **situation 1:** Factory A was out of spec on the snap features for a new product. I told them they needed to modifying the tool to get in spec. This takes a week and they shoot new parts, which we fedex to the other side of the Earth, which takes another week. I measure the parts and nothing has changed. I tell them nothing has changed, but they swear up and down that they revised the tool and shot new parts. I tell them to revise the tool again and send new parts. Two more weeks go by and same thing. I'm going ballistic and trying to get the people who control the money to put the fear of god into the factory, but instead I just get a lot of \"Maybe it's a language barrier issue? Have you tried sending pictures?\" Yes, we sent pictures. They're called tool release drawings. I also sent them photos, videos, illustrations, and all manner of emails. Rinse and repeat one or two more times and we finally get parts that work.   &#x200B;  Four months down the road and their sales rep was feeling chatty (drunk or whatever) and confides on Wechat to one of our employees that the actual problem was that Factory A just wasn't paying their toolmaker's bills, so the toolmaker wasn't doing any work. Instead of getting a business loan or whatever to smooth over their cash crunch, they just lied to us, causing us to waste hundreds of dollars in fedex fees, and more than a month of time, countless hours of my own time, and years from my life.   &#x200B;  **situation 2:** Factory B is awarded the contract to produce a product. All along we've been clear that the strap is supposed to be silicone. We get the first samples and notice that the silicone strap is an amazingly good color match for the TPR overmold on the product. Great! Then we notice that the strap is getting permanent elephant skin wrinkles, and has a permanent kink. It smells like a garbage fire and feels gross. \"This part was supposed to be silicone. Are you sure this is silicone?\" \"Yes, this is absolutely silicone.\"   &#x200B;  I take the strap outside and heat it with a lighter. It melts, making flaming drips, and the strap catches fire and sustains it without the lighter. \"We think this is TPR.\" \"No, I promise it is silicone, but it is injection silicone. \\[i.e. LSR\\] Maybe you don't like injection silicone? We can make it from pressed silicone instead.\" Surprisingly they retool the part for pressed silicone without any charge to us. They send us new parts and they're exactly what we wanted. It only delayed our project by a month.   &#x200B;  A year and  a half later, we're discussing another new project with them. We ask if this product can be made from TPR. The sales rep for Factory B says they don't think that would be a good idea because it would wrinkle and form a permanent kink just like when they used TPR for that strap on that other project.

Due to the nature of their use, these chains have extremely strict length and torsion tolerances.  We visited the factory twice, once to inspect if they could even meet those standards.

This was important as any defect would mean we had to fix the problem ASAP and fly-in replacement chain, as we are not holding much stock. (The 1000+Kg boxes normally come via boat.)  After 5 years of this going great, we suddenly get a shipment of horrid chains. They was so much torsion in them, that the chain would do a 360 in a 10 meter piece when loaded.

They call us that something must have gone wrong during transport(Yeah right....). as they cannot find the issue in their factory. But they are flying in replacement chain regardless.  Of course, this explanation is bullshit, so we switch to our German backup supplier and plan a last minute trip to the factory of our primary supplier.

{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old: Why, in a car with a manual transmission, does the car turn of when you raise the clutch too quickly?", "preferred": "The engine is rotating.  The wheels are stationary.  The clutch \"joins\" the engine to the wheels (basically).  If you immediately join - in effect - the rotating engine to the stationary wheels one of two things happen:  \\- The wheels move.  You will jerk forward a little.  \\- The engines stops rotating.  The engine will stall.  This is known as a stall, because you have literally stopped the engine from moving.  An engine that stops moving cannot \"recover\" from that, because it relies on constantly keeping moving all the time in order to run.  If you raise the clutch slowly, both the above happen but in a much more minor and gentle capacity - the engine will slow, and the wheels will start to accelerate.  In other words, your RPM will drop, but your car will start to pull away.  Doing it rapidly basically locks the engine, so it can't move around to the next combustion cycle, so it stops quite harshly.  A stall.", "rejected": "Because the clutch separates the engine from the tires. When you lift the clutch, you start making a connection with the tires, and so the engine is going to try to spin the tires.  However if you do this too quickly, you're suddenly causes a big spike in the load for the engine, and the engine simply cannot produce enough power to spin the wheels instantly.   When you lift the clutch slower, the clutch starts gently applying force to the wheels, allowing it to slowly come up to speed, instead of everything being dumped at once.   So you're spreading out the work the engine has to do to make the car move over a longer period of time, which is easier for the engine to do.   It's like asking you to lift 100kg or to lift 10kg 10 times, the latter is much easier to do.   This is also why diesel engines stall less easily, because they produce more torque. And also why electric engines don't stall, because they have maximum torque available right from the go, unlike combustion engines."}

I have searched the web for an answer if people can learn to drive by playig racing games, and all people had replied \"no\".

It's the in the same ballpark, but it's like driving the most numb, dead, car ever made. For one, the clutch has no feel. In a real car, a clutch pedal has a spot in its throw where the clutch begins to engage and clamp itself to the engine. When you have that pedal pushed just so far, you can feel it in your toes. You can feel the engine & whole chassis vibrate in subtle ways. It's these little cues that you actually use to get a car moving from a stop. I've tried adding some mods, using a vibration motor from a game controller to add tactile feedback at the clutch engagement point but it's still not the same.   There's no \"shift-lurches\" to tell you when you're not being as smooth as you could be. The software will allow you to be extremely bad at using three pedals and still allow the car to operate properly.

Bread pudding can be fully assembled before you leave, thrown in the fridge, then baked as soon as you get home if you think after dinner activities will take some time.  If you have time to reheat it low and slow, you have time to bake it fresh. Bread pudding is a dense casserole type of bake and if it's cold, it'll take a long time to heat up. My microwave reheats require breaking it up a bit so it reheats faster and dries out much less. It could take an hour alone just to reheat, you know?

The evidence I have seen suggests in-person impersonation voter fraud is negligible - to the tune of high single-digit cases across all voting districts in the US over a decade.  I'm not convinced that the effort and money being expended are justified by the magnitude of the problem.  2. I agree in principle that there is no reason why a person shouldn't have an acceptable ID of *some* kind (note some states that have voter ID laws do not require a photo ID), but in practice there are additional burdens placed on some people who lack the requisite source documents (not their fault if their parents did not maintain them) or have difficulty using the public services required to obtain the ID card.  The specific reason I have been opposed to most voter ID laws are for what is packaged with them - limitation or elimination of early voting (which can help with long lines), limitations on keeping a polling place open for those who were already in line at closing time, and pre-registration of those nearing age 18.  Additionally, a number of these laws have been introduced less than a year (some under 3 months) before a presidential election cycle - allowing very little time for those people who need to obtain an ID to do so.  In an environment with a responsive DMV with plentiful operating hours, this issue would be simpler, but it is not.  The laws being introduced far from a presidential election cycle seem less tactically intended to disenfranchise groups preferentially lacking IDs.

(as an aside: given the potential for serious abuse, one would have to believe that there are great benefits to restricting voting - i.e. reducing voter fraud.  i don't have time to google, but it's well demonstrated that the opposite is true.  voter fraud is a surprisingly rare occurrence, at least in the US.)"}

{"prompt": "Engineers asked to run machines during union strike. Thoughts? A strike is about 100% likely at the plant I work in and there's been talk of salaried employees running machines. During the last strike engineers ended up running machines for something like 12 weeks. Is this something that is typical?

What are your experiences?", "preferred": "If an engineer at $28/hour (which is a fairly  entry level wage) is running a machine an operator would be running at $18/hour (which is about what you get with a union and a few years' experience) the company is still likely losing money, and likely producing slower/losing more product to out-of-spec than the operator is capable of, but it allows them to meet the deadlines they agreed to in various contracts.   The union is likely ok with it because it's a safety net that ensures the company is still going to be around to work out a deal with the union. Some operators might be pissed and resort to name calling but that's because they don't have an objective nor full view of the situation.", "rejected": "This is typical for a unionized plant.

Journal of Economic Surveys 19 (5), 767-787.  Outsourcing the provision of traditionally publicly provided services has become commonplace in most industrialized nations. Despite its prevalence, there still is no consensus in the academic literature on the magnitude (and determinants) of expected cost savings to the government, nor the sources of those savings. This article considers the arguments for (and against) outsourcing and then examines the empirical evidence pertaining to whether any observed savings occur and whether they persist over time. In addition, we examine the existing evidence for the 'redistribution hypothesis' and the 'quality-shading hypothesis', which critics have used to argue that outsourcing lowers government expenditure by lowering wages and conditions and/or lower quality services. Finally, we consider the impact of contract design on outsourcing outcomes. While the power of incentives is a strong theme in economics, recent work has suggested that high-powered incentives may be suboptimal for many public sector services, because they may crowd out intrinsic motivation, particularly in instances where agents are highly motivated. We discuss the implications of this insight for the efficiency of public sector outsourcing.", "rejected": "A lot of the time, nationalized firms were private firms who produced public goods or services. Many of these became loss making, but were still very necessary. Therefore, they become nationalised by the government. If you are producing below the average cost curve, you must be an inefficient company in terms of profit making (the firm is making a loss). The government on the other hand does not need to worry about making a profit as they are producing where the social benefit is maximised (or in theory they should be) rather than trying to achieve profit maximisation like the monopolised private industry."}

I wrote out every major incident I could remember over the past year and planned to share my experiences with the HR independent contractor that we use.   I called last week to give the HR contractor a heads up that I would like to discuss some things, and gave them a general outline of what I wanted to talk about, without specific examples. I did use the words \"bullying, gaslighting and intentionally excluding and dividing employees.\" The HR contractor told me that they would have to begin an immediate investigation, based on the language I was using, which would start as soon as we have an official meeting about it.   My questions are: Is the HR contractor correct in that this sounds like cause for official investigation? What does that investigation process look like? Who is involved?

If you've provided specific dates & times of incidents, they may speak to any witnesses.  They may review security camera footage if applicable.

{"prompt": "CMV: Most of the ways gender identity is explained to cis people are counterproductive because the they conflate gender identity with gender expression and roles. The key to explaining gender identity more clearly is to acknowledge it is likely physical, just in brains not sex characteristics. I've been trying pretty hard to figure out my hang-ups about the (great and needed) ways society is changing about gender. I believe I sorted out part of my confusion this week, but of course I could be totally or partially wrong. Here it goes:\u00a0  The description of \"What if you woke up in a male body?\" (I'm female), \"Imagine how wrong that would feel,\" ect., doesn't elicit much feeling in me. It would be a big change, but I do not imagine some horrible disconnect. Similarly, my answer to \"How would you feel if you were constantly\u00a0called 'Sir'\" is not that bad. I might be mildly annoyed, I might get used to it. I've heard other people say the same type of thing, sometimes\u00a0on this sub.\u00a0  I thought perhaps some people simply had strong connections to their gender and I had a weak one, and maybe most trans people fell into the category of a strong connection to a sense of gender that I couldn't imagine. But, now I think that cis people who imagine waking up in a differently sexed body or being misgendered would be horrible aren't imagining anything close to gender dysphoria; they are imagining discomfort around gender role changes and/ or just not thinking about it very deeply.\u00a0  The thing is, when I picture waking up in a male body, I'm still picturing feeling the\u00a0match to that body that I feel to this one. I've heard gender dysphoria described as something along the lines of \"Think of the brain as a blueprint for the body. When your body doesn't match the blueprint, your brain gets upset.\" Kind of related to phantom limb syndrome. Trans people sometimes describe the relief of beginning\u00a0to take hormones, and the feeling that their brain really really wanted that hormone. Which brings me to another explanation I hear of gender: \"Sex is your physical body, gender is in your brain.\" While I understand gender is in your brain, I think it's perhaps important to clarify that it is likely physical, part of the physical blueprint of your brain. My gender is a woman because I have a female body and my brain chemistry/ blueprint/ ect matches that. That's all gender identity is to me, and it seems like gender identity for almost everyone might be which first and secondary sex characteristics and hormones their brains want. Physical.\u00a0  When I imagine waking up in a male body, I don't imagine the disconnect, because I don't imagine the brain mismatch. I think that's more useful for cis people to understand, instead of thinking gender dysphoria is about the types of discomfort they would feel waking up in an opposite sexed body with a brain that was okay with it, which revolve more around gender roles and sudden change. Perhaps some cis people can imagine the mismatch better than me, but it certainly seems like common hangup.\u00a0  I also think the non-bianaray identity adds\u00a0to the confusion because people mean different things by it. The best I can tell, some people who identify as non-bianary have a physical brain thing like trans men and women, but some people mean something that is less physical and more of a choice. I'd guess some non-bianary folks's\u00a0identification as such is more about not subscribing to gender expression norms. Or perhaps some mix. I'm not saying anyone is doing anything wrong by identifying for different reasons, but I think perhaps they are very different things and calling them the same thing makes the difference between physical gender identity and choice gender expression muddy.\u00a0  And I think treating the\u00a0two as separate is important. If the world is moving towards announcing pronouns often, I want to know what I mean when I say she/ her. Before I looked at things the way I described above, I was very stressed out about saying she/ her, because I didn't know what it meant (I know that this stress does not compare to the stress others have around pronouns). I thought perhaps she/ her was identifying as having some connection to my gender that I didn't. I vaguely wondered if the lack of connection was what some people described as non-bianary. This also seems to be a common train of thought and confusion. I'm feeling better about saying she/ her now.\u00a0  My intention is not to police and pick apart the\u00a0way people identify for the sake of it or to block people from making space for themselves and their identity. I absolutely love that the discussion around gender is changing, both selfishly because I like having more flexibility and fun in expression, and because it's hopefully starting to make the world a safer, happier place for trans and nonconforming folks. But, if I'm supposed to announce my pronouns, I think it's reasonable to want to understand what I'm saying with it.\u00a0  So TD;LR: I think talking about the blueprint analogy and calling gender identity likely physical in the brain is a better way to describe gender to cis people, and might help some people who are really trying to get past their hang-ups and understand, but don't want to say they understand something they don't.\u00a0  The biggest counterpoints I can think of are 1) maybe some cis people can imagine the mismatch in a way I can't and the explanations work fine for them as is, and 2) if the explanations elicit sympathy and get cis people on board with supporting trans and genderqueer people, they are productive, even if the sympathy doesn't line up with actual experience, and that might be more important than consistency 3) calling gender identity likely physical in the brain is an oversimplification and/or incorrect 4) Pronouns are meant to encompass both gender identity and gender expression, so you don't know from pronoun choices which people mean. I'd still think that needs to be made explicitly clear and we need to be careful which we're tapping into with explanations of gender.\u00a0  Okay, whew, thanks anyone who read all that. I apologize if I accidentally said anything hurtful, and I'm glad there's a space to ask these kinds of questions. Any thoughts are appreciated, and I'm very open to being wrong about all or some of this.

A better (though still imperfect) approach might be to imagine this as something gradual and easier to relate to:  So say you wake up one morning, and everything is normal except your throat hurts and your voice is hoarse. Nothing seems to help. Over the next few days, you realize that your breasts seem to have shrunk. Your skin is noticeably rougher. Moisturizing makes no difference. Tiny hairs have started sprouting where they previously didn\u2019t, like all around the lower half of your face. You shave it off. It\u2019s back the next day. You shave it off again. Your voice is unsteady and keeps breaking in pitch. Your genitals feel weird.  Over the next few weeks, you realise you\u2019re putting on weight. Not just fat, but muscle, your body filling itself out and straightening out all your curves. You start eating less, but you\u2019re so hungry, and losing weight only accentuates how angular your body has become. None of your clothes fit right. You buy new clothes. People at the store stare and whisper behind your back. Your chest continues to flatten until it\u2019s barely visible under a shirt. Your hips have shrunk to the point you need a belt to keep your pants on. None of your shoes fit. Also there\u2019s hair on your toes. You keep clearing your throat, but your voice keeps coming out low, like a bad cold you can\u2019t shake. You\u2019re sweating more than you used to. You need to change your clothes more often or they stink. Hair continues sprouting all over your limbs and covering your barely existing breasts. Shaving it off is a losing battle, and starts to hurt. Down there, a penis is slowly but surely emerging. You feel it every time you walk, bumping against your inner thigh.  etc.   I\u2019m quite bad at this lol because I\u2019m a trans guy and those were things that made me happy, but the trans women I know had the opposite experience when puberty hit. The average cis girl would likely have felt similarly if her body had also started masculinising, vs just embracing it and deciding to just be a guy then.  There have been cases of that happening to people with rare intersex conditions that trigger natural sex changes similar to what trans people on HRT experience. In some cases they are totally fine with it, even happy, but many others are instead completely horrified and start doing all they can to stop it.", "rejected": "> The thing is, when I picture waking up in a male body, I'm still picturing feeling the match to that body that I feel to this one.

The \"brain map theory\" is a theory that is often posited but has multiple problems with it and certainly isn't scientific fact. A couple of problems with it are:  - individuals that are born with missing limbs almost never develop phantom limb syndrome, but indeed sometimes do - phantom limb syndrome symptoms almost always diminish over time and most often completely disappear after a while - many transgender individuals do experience social dysphoria, which this theory can't explain, only physical - many transgender individuals do not wish to have bottom surgery at all\u2014like this number is really very high.  This hypothesis isn't really an answer; it's a hypothesis that fails to explain many things.  My problem with this, and most of psychiatry is that the umbrella comes before the cause: psychiatrists decide rather arbitrarily to group a set of symptoms together,and then go try find the single-identifiable cause that should explain it, with no evidence that such a single identifiable cause even exists but they often work on the assumption that it must exist, that there must exist one single explanation that is common to all the cases they decided to group together with no real scientific argument that they should even be grouped together to begin with, especially when the symptoms are really often quite different and only superficially similar when you get down to it.  > So TD;LR: I think talking about the blueprint analogy and calling gender identity likely physical in the brain is a better way to describe gender to cis people, and might help some people who are really trying to get past their hang-ups and understand, but don't want to say they understand something they don't.   It is perhaps a better way to explain it for those for which it works that way.  My own belief and experience talking to individuals about such matters has left me to conclude that there is _vast_ variance in how different individuals experience it to begin with\u2014the number of inividuals that underwent a gender transition that are only bothered by secondary sex characteristics, not primary ones, and only certain ones of them, not all, is quite high.

Same way the concept of the entire English language isn't owned by anyone, etc. DNS *as a protocol* is, in a thick nutshell, just a big fancy list that pair human-readable names (web domain addresses) to machine-usable names (IP addresses), and a bunch of rules that dictate the chain of command of whose list you can trust when you have multiple machines. To break that down a a bit... when you type \"reddit.com\" into the browser of a computer that has never been to that website before, it doesn't know where the server with that webpage is at. It needs an IP address, not a wordy name. So it asks a computer it trusts if it knows where to find it. If that computer doesn't know, it can ask a computer it trusts to know. And so on, and so forth, until you get to the computer that literally wrote the rule for it. This chain of command and the way computers ask each other like this is the DNS.  The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is, at this time, the entity that gets to decide who owns what website, as they are also the overseers of the world's largest DNS network via their subsidiary, the (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority). If you want a website to point to the IP address for your server for everyone who looks up that address with ICANN's DNS system (which is almost everyone), you basically need to ask them permission. They need to voluntarily update their system so that everyone who comes knocking asking for the IP address to \"yourcooldomainwebsite.whatever\" will be told to go to your server's IP address. How do you do that? You pay them. Costs a lot of money to basically run the public Internet, gotta fund it somehow. Except, you probably won't pay them directly. You will likely be going through a domain registrar like GoDaddy, who acts as a middleman wholesaler. Why do these places exist? Because ICANN can't reasonably handle listening to every little request to buy a web domain around the entire planet, so they delegate that job to wholesalers.  A big key word in that description of ICANN is that they own the *largest* DNS network. They don't \"own\" DNS any more than Merriam Webster \"owns\" English. You can actually choose to trust whoever you want to feed you DNS information. It's merely that basically every device, operating system, and piece of software that has the ability to choose who it trusts tends to come pre-assumed to trust ICANN for this information. You don't *have* to trust ICANN. I mean, there's a huge laundry list of reason why you probably *should*, but you don't *have* to. You can trust whoever you want. And whoever is the root of the system you end up trusting is effectively in charge of that big list of who owns what website.  The point in me bringing this up is that the question was asked in the context of \"What gives whoever is on top *the right* to charge for owning a web domain?\" The simple answer to that, is that the system we live and work in is bathed in a general assumption that ICANN (or anyone who preceded them) was in control from the beginning. When you buy a new Windows PC, for example, it comes preinstalled with a list of certificates it trusts, signed through some chain of command back up to ICANN. Whenever you connect to a network, and you ask the local DNS authority to tell you what's what, you basically assume that authority has some chain of command back to ICANN. And if you don't trust them, you can verify it for yourself, and it will pretty much always be the case. So, ICANN has the authority to charge because... well, we let them do it. Nothing is stopping anyone from throwing their hands up in the air and starting their own root DNS authority. There are already a few relatively notable alternatives. But good luck getting anyone to use (and more importantly, *trust*) you to keep it running, and keep it running better than ICANN. You either play by ICANN's rules to get into their system, or you toss away your access to the overwhelming majority of people who trust ICANN to tell them where websites are.", "rejected": "There is an agency that oversees the naming and records if names for the internet (icons or iana). When you initially pay, you are paying to establish your domain. If someone else owns the name, you need to work out the sale with them, then the database can be updated to show you as the owner, like registering your motor vehicle. Beyond that, when you pay your host, you are paying them for the space your sites takes on their servers (like cloud storage)  there are fees that also cover the annual or bi annual fee to maintain your ownership, again like registering your motor vehicle. The agencies that oversees the naming are nonprofit  so there are no crazy fees for it. If you want to start a website, shop for your host or registar."}

{"prompt": "CMV: AI generated art is legitimate art With the rise in access and popularity in AI generated art i have seen huge debates on whether or not it's \"legitimate\" art.   Imo i would consider it art, especially when given the fact that art is fully subjective. Skill/ time invested or effort does not correlate with whether something can be viewed as art.   It's funny how much scrutiny that AI art is facing in an abstract art subreddit considering how a common view on abstract art is \"i could have done that\" to which the reply being \"but you didn't.\" I think this seriously applies when speaking on AI art as it is in infancy as a medium (atleast to my knowledge is fairly new)   I think what we're seeing is a knee jerk reaction to a newly budding medium.  The same way digital altered photographs were not seen as art and abstract art's criticism of \"that takes no skill\"  If the art community is to continue to grow and develop we can't gatekeep what is considered art. Because every single person has different definitions. Is the person who enter the prompt to generate AI art an artist?  I say it's as legitimate as anyone else who calls themselves an artist regardless of skill level.   Personally i have enjoyed some AI generated art,  i would have found it more impressive had it been an acrylic painting but that doesn't take away from me liking the emotions the piece illicits.  i do however think it's important to label something as AI art,  if only because i feel like it can be misleading and be seen as almost stealing the art by claiming you physically created it. But that might just be a \"me\" thing.", "preferred": "I understand art to be communicative action in which what is implicit is more important than what is explicit. There are a of grey areas when it comes to what is and isn't art. If a person appreciates the marks left by birdwings in snow, it that or isn't that art? If an artist composes a poem and never writes it down or speaks it to anyone, is that or isn't that art?  It seems to me that it must be seen by either the artist or the audience as communicating something.  I would say that something done purely to gain money or only appreciated because of money isn't art, but commerce. With AI generated art, the programmer of the AI acts as the artist, but only if that person is programming as a communicative action, not if they are doing it strictly as a financial endeavor.  Even if the programmer isn't attempting to communicate, the work of the AI might still be art if viewers see it as such.  Currently fiction book covers are seen as advertising, not as art. Their quality is judge by book sales, something that  highly AI driven--it has more to do with the advertising and writing-to market/algorithm than with human communicative action.  So by and large commercially produced, AI-generated images aren't art, but that goes for the majority of commercially produced images.", "rejected": "See we can talk about the scammy world of abstract and fine art and what it actually means for something to have value. But for the purposes of just AI, an important distinction is how it creates art. Procedural art is different from random smears of paint. Because it's not random, if you write a program that works the same exact way, it creates the exact same piece. There's nothing unique about generated art.  Now of course, that's not how they all work. The more advanced ais that most people know actually draw from memory. That's why they don't do faces very well. They simply interpret the prompt references. Which makes them closer to Photoshops than original art, and while the different programs tend to have their own styles, at the end of the day, it's still procedural generation."}

{"prompt": "Resources to learn fine dining/Michelin style cooking at home I've recently been more and more interested in learning more about Michelin style cooking. Sometimes I get put off by the rare and extravagant ingredients OR complex cooking procedures that are used to create these dishes, I have access to a fair amount of equipment, but nothing incredibly fancy. I was wondering if anyone has some good resources that could guide me to cook fine-dining styled food, but on a budget. And by a budget I mean \u00a35-\u00a310 per head kind of budget. I've looked about and have found so-so information and some of it feels falsely pretentious.      Is there some kind of flavour theory guide that would help me pair ingredients? What tips could you give to excel in the finer side of cooking?", "preferred": "Fine dining chef here. I've posted a few times before about the fundamental differences between restaurant cooking and home cooking and how a home cook can elevate their quality and execution.   * Learn proper technique- Jacques P\u00e9pin's New Complete Techniques is a great starting point. Its a progressive teaching tool with an emphasis on foundation techniques with lots of photos. Follow up with his is old KQED/PBS shows that are available on Youtube for free. For the advanced version, CIA's The Professional Chef will broaden horizons when it comes to product identification, breaking down proteins, and more advanced techniques.  * Learn the underlying principles of the science of food- Harold McGee's On Food & Cooking is the OG book that is on the shelf of every chef I know. If you're into video and lectures, Harvard's food science lecture series is on Youtube for free. The more you understand how food cooks, the easier it is to tackle more complex dishes.  * Start to develop intuitive cooking by eating a variety of cuisines and learning what goes with what. When culinary students ask me how to develop a better palate my advice is simply just eat as varied cuisines as you can afford. The Flavour Bible is also a great resource for what goes with what.  * Up your plating game by understanding plating concepts of colour, contrast, construction, and composition. This is a major difference with how home cooks approach a dish vs. a professional. r/culinaryplating is also a great place to learn.  * Some general tips and tricks learned when working in a fast paced kitchen.  * Sometimes quality tools count-  a good knife and learning how to take care of it is a game changer. r/chefknives has a great wiki and getting started guide. Good knife skills will make cooking go 90% faster. A consistent julienne is going to look better and cook more consistently than a pile of matchsticks of varying size.  * A lot of the time why a restaurant dish is superior is access to high quality, artisanal ingredients. Not essential to fine dining across the board but we're often working with a butcher who is custom aging steaks, day boat fish deliveries, etc. that are difficult for the home cook to access. You can still make a great dish using regular products with fundamentals and complexity that will get you closer to fine dining.  * Tackling more complex and heavy prep dishes found in fine dining will be aided by good habits-  mise en place and clean as you go. Organising your work environment is the key to being efficient with your labour and time in a kitchen. For example, when I am prepping, I have three bowls- 1] for uprepped product, 2] for scrap, 3] for finished prep. Think ahead, combine steps where you can. Clean as you go means get rid of scrap, re-use that bowl, wipe down, organise used tools, don't be a disaster child who has seventeen dirty spoons and flour everywhere once you put something in the oven and crack open a beer.   * Use recipes from known sources to improve your cooking. While videos can be helpful for understanding steps, cookbooks, while not always error free, have been tested and edited with a review process lacking in other sources. Pick a chef whose food is the style you are looking to work with and source one of their books. Many libraries have great line ups of cookbooks so you can rent before you own.", "rejected": "Have a look at Jules Cooking on YouTube.

{"prompt": "An introduction of analytic philosophy to a continental? Hi, so some basic background. I'm currently doing my Ph.D in critical theory focusing on engaging Queer Theory with Critical Race Theory and basically my MA was in Sociology but also focused on Queer Theory so my whole background in philosophy is basically Continental (think Husserl, Marx, Freud, Nietzsche, Heidegger, the Frankfurt School, Lacan, Foucault, Derrida, Delueze, Guattari, Butler, the whole deal).  Basically coming from a Women's/Genders studies undergrad to a sociology MA to a Critical Theory Ph.D I've never really stepped out of the Continental tradition and recently while talking to a professor who's opinions I hold in high regard they strongly recommended I study analytic philosophy even if I didn't think I would ever use it. As it's not the first time I've heard that I might benefit from studying analytic philosophy, whether it be for clarity of writing or just to examine the tools the tradition offers to see if I might want to use any of them (someone once told me I kind of write like an analytic and there's a market for explaining continental philosophy in analytic terms and if I ever fail at breaking into academia that that was always an option...), I figured I'd give analytic philosophy a shot.  That being said everybody around me basically only engages in Continental so asking around kind of led me here.

Anderson's *What is the Point of Equality?* requires no prior knowledge of any kind, and its clarity and logical structure makes it, in my opinion, a fantastic example of what is expected of an \"analytic paper\". Another good example of an analytic paper is Gettier's *Is Justified Belief True Knowledge?*."}

I'm here with Subutai Ahmad, VP of Research at Numenta, as well as our Open Source Community Manager, Matt Taylor. We are on a mission to figure out how the brain works and enable machine intelligence technology based on brain principles.  We've made significant progress in understanding the brain, and we believe our research offers opportunities to advance the state of AI and machine learning.   Despite the fact that scientists have amassed an enormous amount of detailed factual knowledge about the brain, how it works is still a profound mystery. We recently published a paper titled A Framework for Intelligence and Cortical Function Based on Grid Cells in the Neocortex that lays out a theoretical framework for understanding what the neocortex does and how it does it. It is commonly believed that the brain recognizes objects by extracting sensory features in a series of processing steps, which is also how today's deep learning networks work. Our new theory suggests that instead of learning one big model of the world, the neocortex learns thousands of models that operate in parallel. We call this the Thousand Brains Theory of Intelligence.  The Thousand Brains Theory is rich with novel ideas and concepts that can be applied to practical machine learning systems and provides a roadmap for building intelligent systems inspired by the brain.

The point of *my* criticism against the rich is mostly that they hold an undue amount of influence over society at large. The wealthy can afford to hire lobbyists, buy off judges and local politicians, and insulate themselves from liability or targeted criticism by being able to throw up walls of attorneys and wage negative PR campaigns. They have the money to hire reputation management firms and to sue you for frivolous reasons without any meaningful consequence.   Additionally, many super rich individuals don't use their money or, more importantly, their influence for the betterment of society to the degree that they could. For example - Jeff Bezos has enough value in his assets that, if only a fraction were liquidated, it could fund vaccination of entire countries against certain diseases.  I'll grant that many of the more vocal \"eat the rich\" crowd fail to articulate meaningful reasons to initiate a social attack against the wealthy, and that some are misguided or can't get past simple thinking in believing that simply making the current rich people not rich anymore would solve our problems, but there are perfectly legitimate reasons to be concerned by how uneven concentrations of wealth also means *uneven concentrations of power -* which is the real concern.  To your point - yes, I would like to be rich. I do not deny it nor have I ever denied it. The point of those criticizing wealthy individuals is *usually* not that being rich or wealthy is *inherently bad* (meaning that being wealthy in and of itself is a social sin), it is, as I mentioned, that these individuals exercise undue amounts of influence over our society as a whole. Severe wealth inequality = power inequality, which damages individual sovereignty.

Suppose you have a 3% profit margin and can cut costs by 3%.  You've now doubled your profits. Now suppose your costs suddenly rise by 3%. Your profits are completely wiped out.  A lot of the people you're talking about would *ensure* they'd never have the \"opportunity\", by both running their businesses less ruthlessly (say firing people less) and running their personal lives less selfishly (giving away lots of money as they get it).  They would simply never get to billionaire status.  And a lot of these people do just that.  They might be small business owners who run their businesses in more community focused ways such that it never sees the kind of profit margins required to expand it to a national company.  Or maybe they decided instead of getting into business getting into charity work which pays much worse and doesn't have the same sort of profit sharing for the people running it at the top.  So a lot of these people DO have that opportunity and simply don't take it, but you never really see the act of \"not taking the opportunity\" because they never get super rich.  For example, JK Rowling is no longer a billionaire because of how much money she has given away.  If her ramp up to success hadn't been so fast, she might have been giving money away all along and simply never reached billionaire status.  So no, it is not just jealousy.

{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old: What physically happens to your body when you get a second wind?", "preferred": "The thing about second winds is that they can't be counted on when you need them. They're a real phenomenon, yes, but what they are not is a predictable phenomenon.  Second winds depend on a number of factors, including everything from exercise intensity and frequency to what kind of shape you're in. But although physiologists know they happen, they don't all agree what's going on behind the scenes to cause it. Some theorize that your second wind, also known as a runner's high, may be caused by the body's release of pain-relieving endorphins. However, that doesn't explain the whole thing. More commonly that \"high\" is believed to happen as the body's systems come back into balance: Your respiration is regulated; your oxygen intake is fast, deep and plenty; and your body is operating at a slightly elevated temperature, covering you in a light sweat.  When your second wind kicks in, which takes roughly 10 to 15 minutes to happen, give or take five minutes or so (generally, that is; some people may have to wait much longer), it's because your body has stopped focusing on expelling excess carbon dioxide and started taking in more oxygen. That's aerobic energy production (also called aerobic metabolism), and that translates into less pain, easier breathing and a renewed confidence that although you might not have wanted to exercise, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea after all.  **Fueling Your Second Wind**  An energy-carrying molecule known as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) fuels every living thing \u2014 you, me, plants, animals, all of it \u2014 and, when you get right down to it, it's what fuels your second wind.  Adenosine nucleotides are part of the energy production systems of your body, specifically the energy metabolism of your cells. ATP is created from the process of metabolizing the carbohydrates, fats and proteins you consume. It's formed by a high-energy bond between lower-energy phosphates, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inactive    The body makes an ongoing supply of ATP, and it starts with the breakdown of sugars from food. First, a reactive process called glycolysis traps and converts glucose, a monosaccharide, and converts it into fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. Next, that fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is split into two molecules of three-carbon pyruvic acid (CH3COCOOH); that's important, because ATP is produced when those three-carbon molecules are oxidized into pyruvate, the final product of the glycolysis energy-conversion process. In short, your body is constantly breaking down the food you eat and converting it to stored energy, which can fuel that second wind.  Because ATP is critical and stored only in limited amounts, the process of hydrolysis and resynthesis is circular and ongoing. ADP and Pi combine to synthesize and replenish the body's ATP, and through hydrolysis, ATP is broken down into ADP and Pi as needed for energy. That equation that looks like this: ATP + H2O \u2192 ADP + Pi + energy [source: Encyclopedia Britannica].   **The Physiological Process of a Runner's High**  The human body fuels itself through three types of energy production methods, depending on how intense and how long you engage in that physical activity: phosphagen, anaerobic and aerobic energy production.  When energy is needed in a hurry, it's the phosphagen system that gives the body immediate energy, lasting only for seconds; ATP is able to fuel some pretty intense muscle contractions, but not for very long. Because the supply of ATP stored in the muscles is limited, the body can only sustain short bursts of energy, like sprinting for no more than five to six seconds [source: Berg]. During intense, short periods of exercise, ATP is rapidly replenished by creatine phosphate, which is stored in the body's skeletal muscles.  After that first five seconds, the rate of glycolysis \u2014 that's the process that converts glucose to pyruvate, which is needed for cellular respiration \u2014 dramatically increases by 1,000 times than while the body's at rest. The anaerobic energy system, which uses carbohydrates but no oxygen to provide for the body's energy demands, takes over [source: Stipanuk et al.]. ATP is rapidly generated during anaerobic glycolysis, to be used during intense physical activities lasting between 30 seconds and three minutes [source: Gagliardi]. If the body's demand for oxygen becomes and remains greater than what you're supplying, there is an increased risk of lactic acidosis, when pH levels decrease in the body and byproducts of the breakdown of glucose to pyruvate accumulate in the body's tissues and bloodstream.  Most of the body's energy needs, though, are produced through a process called aerobic metabolism, also known as mitochondrial respiration. During aerobic endurance exercise, oxygen is required to generate energy from carbohydrates and fats \u2014 and to keep up the production of ATP, although its synthesis is low when the aerobic metabolism has kicked in. When the measure of your oxygen consumption (V02) reaches the maximum volume of oxygen your body can use (V02max), you've arrived at your second wind. You're what some refer to as \"in the zone\" \u2014 you're focused, you're not in pain, and your breathing deepens to provide maximum levels of oxygen to your working muscles and maximum ATP regeneration.  As your body gets accustomed to exercising and regulating its energy needs, the odds increase that you'll see your second wind kick in more frequently because your muscles, including your heart, will be more efficient.  \"I know that I'm going to have a number of highs and lows over the course of an ultra, to the extent that I don't really think of it as a 'second wind' anymore,\" says Rob Colenso, ultra-marathoner and RRCA-certified running coach. \"It's more like, I was able to properly eat and hydrate over the last hour, and so now I feel better and have gotten a burst of energy.\"", "rejected": "My understanding is that your body is switching from mainly glucose (sugar) as fuel, to a combination of glucose, glycogen (long term stored sugar) and fatty acids. Glucose is always around, but as it starts to get used up from your blood, your body will burn and release the other fuels."}

{"prompt": "[Manitoba, CANADA] My cousin lives in a basement suite. His landlord has recently enacted a new rule in their home that states \"Lights Out By 10PM\" - which is enforced via circuit breakers to \"save on power\" and lower landlord's power bills, except my cousin is paying for his own power. As the title states, my cousin is currently renting a basement suite in the house of an older gentleman who owns the property. Legally, the renting situation is done by the book and follows the law to a T. However, three weeks ago my cousin received a notice stating that there will be a new addition to the rules that says \"Lights Out By 10PM\". My cousin isn't overly bothered by this as he is usually in bed by 9PM anyways, and he can understand his elderly landlord wanting peace and quiet at night. Unfortunately, he realized immediately (when it first came into effect) that this is enforced by the landlord by physically turning off the power to the whole house by use of the circuit breakers - aside from the breakers for the refrigerators and freezers. This leads to a few problems:  1. My cousin is unable to see where he is going when using the bathroom or getting water at night without the use of a flashlight or phone (candles are forbidden in the basement suite). 2. My cousin is unable to charge his phone overnight, which is a major issue as he needs it for an alarm and worries about it dying - leading him to potentially sleep in. He can't even run an extension cord from the same socket as the fridge and freezer because he might blow the breaker, and the new rule specifically states that extension cords are not permitted if they are going to be used to circumvent the new rule. 3. The landlord rarely turns on the power at the designated time (8am) due to him either sleeping in, going to church, or just straight up forgetting. This leads to shits, showers, and shaves in the dark (no bathroom window) and is generally an inconvenience. 4. My cousin pays for his own power, and therefore he should be allowed to use his power as he sees fit. Instead, he has to live with this situation because his landlord wants cheaper bills.   We both understand that this a silly first world problem, but he is tired of feeling like he's living the Amish lifestyle and wants to know if there is any legal recourse he could take to find common ground with his landlord. He isn't look to sue the poor man, he just wants to use his own power and is willing to make compromises so both of them are happy. If he could just have the breaker for the bathroom lights and the one for his nightstand/phone charger, he would be a happy camper - however his landlord refuses to budge.

Is this an acceptable substitute? If so, what should I add to make it taste similar to typical cheesecake?", "preferred": "Should work about the same honestly. If your yogurt is looser (which it probably is) ad a tablespoon or two of flour or cornstarch to the sugar and mix it together (this will prevent lumping) before you ad the sugar to the mixture. That will solve the difference in textures.", "rejected": "Is it sweetened? As long as it's plain, it'll be fine. I put yogurt in my cheesecake all the time."}
{"prompt": "Company car I was driving was hit by a drunk driver. Insurance fully paid for the car but the company says I still owe them $40,000 [CA] I was on my way home from work in my company car when I was hit almost head on by a drunk driver. He was found at fault by the police and the insurance company and was charged and convicted. His insurance settled with the company and gave them a payout to replace the car, which the company lawyer accepted. I am still off work recovering from my injuries and I probably won't be back for 3 more months. Last month I received a letter from the company stating that I owed them the cost of the car because I was the one responsible for it when it was totaled and written off. I thought it was mistake or something so I called the insurance company, got written confirmation of the settlement and sent it into them with a note that the car had already been paid for by the insurance company. Now they have sent me to a collection agency and I have debt collectors calling saying I owe $40,000. I live in California. Do I call the insurance company to let them know or do I need to get a lawyer? Is them calling the debt collector even legal?

They should be indemnifying you if this action is being taken by someone else (e.g. the auto insurance.) File a workers compensation claim with an attorney.  Your attorney will also know the Labor Code which prohibits this bullshit. See, generally, An employer may not deduct for cash shortage, breakage, or equipment loss unless caused by the employee's gross negligence, or dishonest or willful act . An employer may deduct from a final paycheck the cost of a uniform, tools, or equipment not returned by a terminated employee within a reasonable time, if the employee gave the employer prior, written authorization to do so and if the employer can show that the employee committed theft or was negligently responsible for the loss.  Defining \u201cgross negligence\u201d and \u201cwillful or dishonest acts.\u201d The California Department of Industrial Relations and court decisions have narrowly interpreted the terms \u201cgross negligence\u201d and \u201cwillful or dishonest acts.\u201d  The Department has explained that while a deduction may be legal if the employer proves that the loss resulted from the employee's dishonesty, willfulness, or grossly negligent act, a simple accusation does not give the employer the right to make the deduction. The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE) has cautioned that use of this deduction may, in fact, not comply with the provisions of the California Labor Code and various California court decisions.  Furthermore, DLSE will not automatically assume that an employee was dishonest, acted willfully or was grossly negligent based on an employer's assertion to justify making a deduction from an employee's wages to cover a shortage, breakage, or loss to property or equipment. According to DLSE, \u201c[t]he Labor Code clearly prohibits any deduction from an employee's wages which is not either authorized by the employee in writing or permitted by law, and any employer who resorts to self-help does so at its own risk as an objective test is applied to determine whether the loss was due to dishonesty, willfulness, or a grossly negligent act. If an employer makes such a deduction and it is later determined that the employee was not guilty of a dishonest or willful act, or grossly negligent, the employee would be entitled to recover the amount of the wages withheld. Additionally, if the employee no longer works for the employer who made the deduction and it's decided that the deduction was wrongful, the employee may also be able to recover the waiting time penalty.\u201d  The Department has also observed that \u201c'gross negligence' has been defined as an extreme departure from the ordinary standard of conduct, as an entire failure to exercise care, as the exercise of so slight a degree of care as to justify the belief that there was an indifference to the interest and welfare of others, and as that want of care that raises a presumption of conscious indifference to consequences. A determination of gross negligence is a legal conclusion that can only be arrived at by a court of law .\u201d (Emphasis added.)  Thus, depending on the circumstances of the loss or damage, an employee's negligent or intentional misconduct may not constitute gross negligence, or a dishonest or willful act for purposes of the law.", "rejected": "What, approximately, was the value of the car when it was totaled?

Like in what part of the earth's atmosphere (any specific altitude?) does the acceleration slow down, and then fully cut off any acceleration/boosters. Thank you!", "preferred": "there is not a specific altitude, it depends on how high it is, how fast it is going, and how fast of a cruising speed it needs to reach for its purpose in space.   There was a case where during a nuclear  test a manhole cover was launched into space.  it would have stopped accelerating a few hundred feet into the air as it was propelled by a single blast, yet it is likely still hurtling through space.   The issue is atmosphere.  it is a huge waste of energy to try to reach extremely high speeds when you are still in the thicker part of the atmosphere, but it is also a waste to launch too slowly as that is more time spent burning fuel, so there is a sweet spot based on a variety of factors where you want to get through the thicker atmosphere efficiently and then reach the necessary speed", "rejected": "Technically they don't, but I guess it depends on what you mean.  You launch up, and slowly turn to the direction of your orbit, the entire time the rocket motors are on they are feeling high g forces inside the rocket, when they turn the engines off they feel zero gs, and yea, they abruptly will go from 3g to 0g. As for when they turn off, it depends on the specific mission, you need to fire your engine at least at the perigee of your final orbit, that can be done by launching into a suborbital path (with the peak equal to your final perigee) and then relighting a bit for your apogee kick (common for geosync orbits), or you can just do one continuous firing until you are in your final orbit.  Once in orbit, you are in free fall, and you are accelerating at whatever the local gravity is, in earth orbit you are constantly accelerating, but the direction of acceleration keeps changing so your speed does not necessarily change (your velocity does though).  As for how do it change throughout flight, well typically acceleration goes up as the flight progresses, until it's over, more specifically, you launch, it's at least 1g, and as you burn fuel your acceleration goes up, they usually reduce the throttle a bit for max Q, and then throttle back up. Then when the stage is out of fuel they stage, and typically use a lower thrust engine, and it repeats (more and more acceleration), until it finally cuts off and you are at 0g.  And when I say 0g, I mean microgravity, it's when you are accelerating at the same rate as the spacecraft and experience no external forces, you actually are still quickly accelerating."}

{"prompt": "Huge inconsistencies with chocolate chips bag to bag? I have a cottage cookie business that I began last year. Before starting, I tested over 15 brands of chocolate chips. I ended up picking the most delicious chips! They were well priced, limited ingredient, and my customers loved them. I sell my cookies by the dozen and have had some decent success.   However, every so often I would get complaints about the chocolate chips in the cookies. One person claimed the chips were too sweet another too bitter. I didnt think too much about it until one of my regulars asked if I had switched my chocolate chips because her batch tasted different. I informed her I had not, but would of course replace the bad batch. Well I picked up the bad cookies, and she was totally right! The chips tasted like baking chocolate they were so bitter. This prompted me to open every bag of chocolate chips I currently have from the manufacturer. I was shocked! Every single bag was different. Some bags of chocolate chips were sweet, some were bitter.

Are dishes that involve hot peppers a relatively new invention in relation to the history of India or did they take over for a different plant that once provided heat?", "preferred": "Ironically, chili peppers got their name because that was the first big substitute that traders and merchants found to black pepper which was the dominant spice in the world, and to which India had a monopoly. A lot of wars, colonization, and exploration because of spices and black pepper was a big aspect of that.  Black pepper is also one of the main reasons for the word \"curry\" which comes from the South Indian Tamil word \"kari\" which means \"blackened\". Food would be typically blackened by roasting it in fire and/or adding lots of black pepper powder. The local Kerala fish \"kari-meen\" is called so because it has black stripes, and kari means black and meen stands for fish.  That \"kari\" adjective became \"curry\" over time.

This includes the patient\u2019s willingness and ability to correct undesirable factors prior and subsequent to surgery.  5. Prior surgeries of the same or adjacent tissue that will affect the complexity and demand for technical skill and operative time of the planned procedure.  6. The individual surgeon\u2019s and anesthesia provider\u2019s level of experience and skill for the planned procedure as well as the availability of resources in the health system to manage the condition and the expected sequela or consequences of the procedure and disease state. Some patients are better off being transferred to higher levels of acuity such a as emergency department from office, inpatient setting, elective outpatient surgery, or referral to a tertiary care system with increased availability of specialized services, equipment and personnel.   7. The likely incidence of both adverse events and complications both overall and for the particular surgeon, operative team, health system, and region.  8. Availability of support systems to participate in recovery including financial considerations, insurance benefits, network of family and friends, potential caregivers in the home, willingness to participate in counseling, clearances, insurance requirements, and recommended adjuvant therapies including medication compliance and those administered by professional personnel.  9. The very well documented and highly reliable gut feeling of an ethical professional that acts in the patient\u2019s best interests rather than of their own individual finances or reputation.", "rejected": "This may surprise you by being a very controversial issue.  In short, we use the complication and success rates published (often by the best surgeons in the best academic centers) which may or not apply to the situation at hand.  There is a push for surgeons to ise their own complication rate which a junior surgeon may not even have. Learning curves are real and how to convey this is uncertain.  For entirely new procedures, we do our best to guess.  Large databases can provide information as well.   Asking a surgeon what they base the success rate on may be helpful...  I found this published: The definition of risk in surgical patients is a complex and controversial area. Generally risk is poorly understood and depends on past individual and professional perception, and societal norms. In medical use the situation is further complicated by practical considerations of the ease with which risk can be measured; and this seems to have driven much risk assessment work, with a focus on objective measurements of cardiac function. The usefulness of risk assessment and the definition of risk is however in doubt because there are very few studies that have materially altered patient outcome based on information gained by risk assessment. This paper discusses these issues, highlights areas where more research could usefully be performed, and by defining limits for high surgical risk, suggests a practical approach to the assessment of risk using risk assessment tools.

Removing all support from Saudi Arabia ends a lot of Terrorism because the money source would be cut off.", "preferred": "It's almost forgotten history at this point, but one of the first, if not the first modern terrorist attack by radical Islamists happened in Saudi Arabia, and the main target was the legitimacy of the royal family. And prior to that attack, the viewpoints expressed by the terrorists were widely supported by many Saudi's, including the highest religious officials in the country. It was called the grand mosque seizure and it happened in 1979. The main figure behind the attack was a man named Juhayman al-Oteybi, and I think his life and his relationship with the monarchy and the religious authorities in the kingdom really shed a lot of light on how countries like the US developed their diplomatic ties with KSA.  During the 50's and 60's, as oil money began to flow and relations with the west became profitable, Saudi Arabia began to modernize. Slavery was abolished, television broadcasts began, and large buildings were built. These things all played well in the west, but inside Saudi Arabia, this modernization was met with a lot of resistance. Many people lived nomadic lifestyles in the desert, and they valued this simple lifestyle as if it had an almost divine quality to it. That was how you were supposed to live according to the wahhabist interpretation of Islam, and the monarchies excesses were in direct contradiction to those values.  So the monarchy tried to give themselves religious legitimacy to counter these sorts of attacks against them, and the key figure in that story is a man called Bin Baz. Bin Baz was sort of a mediator between the modernizing royal family and the rural conservatives who hated what Saudi Arabia was becoming, and his religious authority within the country was second to none. His views were in line with the extremists, but he was pragmatic as well, and at the end of the day, he would stop short of saying anything that would've gotten him into too much of a conflict with the Saudi royals. He was someone who believed in reform rather than revolution.  Juhayman al-Oteybi was a student of Bin Baz, and he was well respected within the highest circles of this pro-monarchy segment of Saudi Muslims for his positions against the modernization of Saudi Arabia. But then over a period of weeks in 1979, Oteybi and his followers stormed the grand mosque and killed hundreds right at the foot of the kaaba, Islams holiest shrine. They said this attack was because of the excesses and the drifting away from the more traditional views of Islam that had occurred within the Saudi state, and they put the blame squarely at the feet of the royal family.  Then all the men like Bin Baz suddenly had to try and distance themselves and their views from Oteybi, despite publicly supporting Oteybi and saying very similar things in their own sermons for years before. For men like Bin Baz, this meant doubling down on their support of the monarchy and trying to give them the religious legitimacy to keep extremists from trying to overthrow the government. For the ideological successors to Oteybi, like for instance Osama bin-Laden, the whole fiasco validated their framing of the Saudi monarchy as the enemy. As corrupt, heretical rulers who were unfit to be the guardians of Mecca and the holiest sites in all of Islam. Especially since the Saudi's had to enlist the help of Western soldiers to finally put down the insurrection, and these soldiers had been hastily converted to Islam before the raid since non-believers are not allowed to enter the city of Mecca. A move that deeply offended the sensibilities of men like bin Laden.  So to bring this back around to the overall point, this is the dynamic at play that leads people to support the Saudi monarchy even as they fight against Islamic terrorist organizations. Bin Baz was a fucking slimeball. He had archaic views on womens rights, much of what he said could easily have come out of the mouth of some of the most despicable terrorists in modern history, and he helped foster extremist views among the Saudi people and around the world through Saudi funding for the exportation of wahhabism. In a bubble, anyone opposed to terrorism should surely be opposed to this man and his views on what Islam should be . But when given the choice between Bin Baz and outright militants like Juhayman (or perhaps, the choice between the modernizing King Faisal and his radical nephew that assassinated him), the western world would take Bin Baz and Faisal every day of the week. And this is the choice that, rightly or wrongly, Western governments have felt they had to make, and so they've largely tried to support the Saudi government.  I don't necessarily agree with this framing or their decisions, but it certainly isn't as black and white as saying that cutting ties with the monarchy and revoking support would have a positive result in the fight against terrorism. If it were, I think your view would be much more popular with those in power.", "rejected": "If \"terrorism\" was defined as \"religiously radical\" or was defined in terms of the punishments an entity assigns, then you'd be right. But it isn't, so you're not. Being similar in some ways to some terrorists doesn't make Saudi Arabia _ipso facto_ a terrorist state."}

{"prompt": "CMV: Pitbulls should not be viewed as inherently violent I recently saw a comment on here saying essentially \"pitbulls are a dangerous dog breed.\" I replied to the contrary and was surprised by the overwhelming disagreement I got. So, am I wrong here?  My view is that to claim pitbulls are inherently violent does a disservice to them and biases humans to treat them poorly.  Pitbulls are a strong, muscular breed and are often trained by terrible people to be as ill-tempered as possible. In my view, this is stronger evidence that humans are inherently awful rather than pitbulls being dangerous by nature.  I know pitbulls can do lots of harm when they're trained to, but I've personally never met one that was anything less than a certified loverboy.  I'm certain that there are countless great pitbulls that have been passed over for adoption, sheltered, and put down because of the view that they will naturally be violent, and that that fact alone should give us reason enough to reinforce the opposite view - that they will likely be a great dog as long as they're given love and training where needed (just as I would suggest for any large breed!)  So, change my view!", "preferred": "They are a ludicrously dangerous breed of dogs accounting for a shocking large portion of all fatal human attacks.  It\u2019s genetics.

It was probably ten years before I understood how the shadow was formed.  Image here: http://www.mania.com/gallery/30416/25801.jpg.

{"prompt": "CMV: Cancel Culture is wrong because it only goes one way and certain peoples are completely immune to cancel culture. Over the weekend it took 1 NYT columnist to remove Pepe le pew from polite society. This Cartoon Skunk has not been culturally important in what 10-15 years?  Yet he was canceled all the same.   The reason why conservatives hate cancel culture isnt because they necessarily disagree with whom is being canceled( i thought pepe was a goner years ago) but because only select individuals decide who is allowed to stay and who is allowed to go. lets take Future for example, one of the most popular rappers alive right now and certainly of 2015-2019.  one of his most popular songs is called \"mask off\" the lyrics in the chorus are \"Percocet, Molly Percocet\".   my problem with cancel culture is if we agree that Pepe is contributing to rape culture surely future is contributing to the opioid epidemic no? but the gatekeepers do not ever hold rappers  to the same degree that they do this cartoon skunk and if you ever try to bring it up they dismiss you.

All that has happened in recent years is that this process has become democratised through the ease of communication and sharing/storing information that comes with the internet.  While your arguments are fair, cancel culture can be far better countered with arguments from the liberal tradition. Where I am cautious of conservative arguments is that the same *'cohort' of individuals being cancelled today, were the ones cancelling others a few decades ago... e.g. for being a communist or a homosexual. Also, as soon as someone on the left 'steps out of line', many conservatives demand that they also be cancelled.   *obviously not the exact the same people"}

{"prompt": "cmv: I think the term \"Highly Functioning Autist\" is flattering, and I'm proud that I am one. Alright, I have no idea how this will be recieved, so let's just get right into it.  I'm a 23 year old norwegian man diagnosed with ADHD and Aspberger's syndrome. All I've known my entire life is being a little different from most, without most people in day-to-day life being able to immediately put their finger on what it is. After a couple conversations with me, most people recognize that I lack an inherent understanding of social cues, my eye contact is a little off, and some other things. I think most people understand what ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) is, so I won't describe it any further.   Like the title said, I think the term \"Highly Functioning\" is flattering. I don't understand why people are offended by it, especially not the people without ASD who feel a need to defend us from the term, or get offended on our behalf. In my honest experience, most people who has the inherent understanding of the world and the people who inhabit it to actually take offense by the term, can reach a level of societal functionality where they too would be considered \"Highly Functioning\". The people who don't take offense by the term, based on my experience, just don't understand the inherent problematic nature of the word and it's usage, and therefore do not care.  My reasoning for taking this stance is that I have manually learned all I know about socializing, something most people learn naturally while growing up. I've studied the people around me extensively,  watched media (both fictional and reality) for hours on end to recognize patterns in speech and socializing. I've actively listened in on, and participated in conversations throughout my life, even though the most common reaction the first ten years was the others leaving because of something I said/didn't say or because I looked bored/uninterested. I've studied facial movements, expressions, and have had to manually manufacture my own expressions of varying emotions. At this point it's 85% automatic since I've been doing it for so long. However, I feel like becoming a \"Highly Functioning\" member of society is something we should all strive for, and therefore I am proud that I am classified as one considering the inherent disadvantages that stand in my way of doing just that.  Now, it should be said that I have been a part of the mental healthcare system of norway for 15 years now, and have met many others with varying degrees of my own diagnosis, as well as many others with other diagnoses that all belong in the spectrum. I have enough personal experience to speak about this without presenting it in a manner which paints it one way or the other, but I am also sharing my personal experience and opinions so there will be pre-existing biases from my point of view.  I haven't shared this opinion with others before because I can see the issues it might present. Everything from childhood traumas and abuse, to systematic oppression and societal segregation, but at the end of the day it's just a term. All that being said, I'm not completely convinced I'm in the right on this one. I know there's a very good chance I'm missing something here, so I'm interested in hearing your views and thoughts on this Reddit! Go ahead, CMV!", "preferred": "> My reasoning for taking this stance is that I have manually learned all I know about socializing, something most people learn naturally while growing up.

I think you're following a somewhat different idea of \"high functioning\" than what that term entails. The \"high functioning\" is relative to someone with more severe symptoms of autism. That isn't something that we all have to strive for, because non-autistic people are the \"fully functioning\" benchmark already. That isn't even necessarily something that *can* be striven for either, as not all autism symptoms can be mitigated to such an extent through personal effort.  In addition, while your pride in mitigating your symptoms through your effort is entirely valid, that is something highly specific to you. Other people may see things differently. If I see someone with amputated legs swimming and I say, \"You're a pretty good swimmer for a legless dude\", some will see it as a compliment directed at their skill, and others will see it as a reminder of their shortcoming and how their achievements are qualified by that shortcoming. Likewise, you see the term as praise for your efforts, but others may see it as a reminder that they are not \"normal\".  Given that the positive connotation in both those scenarios (good swimmer/good social skills) can be conveyed without using a term that can potentially be perceived negatively (amputee/autistic), I'd say \"high functioning autist\" isn't a flattering term.", "rejected": "You aren't *that* highly functioning.   You've just described an aspect of your life which most would see as a distinct negative, in a positive frame. That's good. However you have posted into r/cmv and the context of your post is that you are inviting people to explain why you are wrong.   Most people are extremely uncomfortable telling someone that a positive aspect in their life is actually a negative."}

Someone has also informed me that kids were: \"fucking each other right and left right up until internet porn because so easy a 9 year old could find it.\"  I don't think this is accurate, mainly because child marriage was for political ties, to enliven a family's wealth, or because nobles did it for these reasons, and the poorer people adopted it not knowing or able to grasp and enact the full \"why\".(as well as getting rid of an extra mouth to feed by marrying her off.)

I was inspired by Claire Saffitz's meringue cookies recipe on her Dessert Person YouTube channel and wanted to make black sesame ones since I love that flavor so much.

{"prompt": "CMV: American political parties (specifically the two-party system) have wrongfully divided citizens and oversimplified political policies I believe that political parties have created a very harsh and distinct lines between political (and even non-political) issues. A very large percentage of voters are moderates and don't swing to either political party to much.  http://news.gallup.com/poll/201152/conservative-liberal-gap-continues-narrow-tuesday.aspx  So, many of my views aren't represented by a presidential candidate. In this past election, it's obvious that voters don't want one of the political parties to win, but they have no choice. Trump is not a true Republican and Bernie was barely a democrat. They both have many different views than their party, yet they were still highly favored by voters.  I'm not suggesting that we should get rid of political parties; instead, we should have some sort of reform to fix how rigid we are able to vote. Our whole government and voting system is centered on this two-party system, that has left America split in two. It's counter-productive. A democratic president gets elected and does one thing, then a republican president get voted in and tries to reverse everything the other guy did, and the cycle continues.

The issue today isn't so much that we have a very black and white system, the issue is the money involved to decide what each side represents. If you vote for each side, you're sometimes voting against things you're passionate about because of something important, which isn't what the system was designed for. If it was more organized, polished, and (more importantly) regulated, there would be a way for each branch to get public attention and the ability to properly argue their stances in order to represent those with the opinions that are compatible with them.  Lets look at the last election for example, who do you vote for? Do you vote for the obvious wallstreet sellout or the obvious incompetent wild card? One is obviously against American ideals, one was against a different set of American ideals.

This embarrassing time in American history can blame many people, but we also can blame our political system placing too much emphasis on advertising in elections. Because of the money involved in getting their message out there, republican and democrat parties are kinda forced to pick an individual and stick to them, meaning some very good candidates are cast aside.   If we solve the issue causing the problem, having a black and white system wouldn't be a problem.

The cure for this problem is dealing with individual issues in the public realm. If you Google my user name you will find our plan to do this."}
{"prompt": "CMV: Capitalism is necessary to motivate people to be productive. Socialism will cause people to be lazy and less productive. I simply don't believe that workers under a socialist system will work as hard, as efficiently, as productively, etc as they would under a capitalist system.  My underlying assumption here is that we DO want a strong economy and that we want a country to be as productive as it can be. Thus I wouldn't be swayed by an argument against the requirement to work or an attempt to convince me that wealth isn't important. For the record, I actually do not care about wealth at all and would probably be okay with a society becoming socialist and thus more lazy. But I do consider it true that a socialist country would not run as efficiently as a capitalist one, and I think employees under a socialist system would work less hard.  CMV.", "preferred": "At my current job, I'm paid a wage to put in a day's work. The product of my labor belongs to my employer. They sell that product, pay my wage, and the remainder, however large, is theirs to keep as profit. From my perspective, working harder means making my boss richer, not me, so my incentive is to basically to work as little as I can without it being noticeable so I don't get fired or suffer a pay cut. Working harder might \"earn\" me a pay increase, that is to say a larger share of the product of my own labor,, but it's not guaranteed, especially since such an increase diminishes my employer's profit margin and makes it more appealing to replace me with someone who'll accept a lower wage.  There are many, many variants of socialism with differing incentive structures, but pretty much all of them cut out the employer middleman and give me some control (either direct or indirect) over the full product of my labor.  Either I directly participate in the control of my workplace (ie. syndicalism or workers councils), or the workplace is controlled by a democratic State that I have input into the functioning of. A system where I control the means of production, directly or indirectly, and thus the product of my own labor, is one where the harder I work, the more I get, would incentivize me to work a lot harder. Capitalism does the exact opposite, it incentivizes me to work just hard enough to keep my job and maybe get myself in line for a not-guaranteed pay increase, but any more than that and I'm a sucker sweating to make my boss rich.  It's sort of like owning your home versus renting it: under which scenario are you more incentivized to make improvements to the building?  edit: Oh, I see elsewhere you think Socialism is just a market economy with regulation and high taxes.

{"prompt": "CMV: The US is actually a pretty good place to live, with a decent welfare state I see a lot of people call the United States a bad place to live, and they bring up rich European countries as alternatives.  Now, undoubtedly, the United States is not the #1 country on a number of metrics, but it is still a very good place to live, and easily in, say, the top 25 of countries in the world, which means it is actually a very very good place to live.  **What Problems Do People Talk About**  First, I think it is important to take a step back, and look at the issues that are often talked about in the United States. I hear a lot of complaints about health care, about the stagnation of wages, the shrinking of the middle class, unequal policing, structural racism, etc.  What do all of these have in common?  None of them are signs of basic failure of a state. We talk about \"food insecurity\", not hunger. We talk about \"lack of health insurance\", not a lack of hospitals, doctors or medicine. We talk about \"aging and insufficient infrastructure\" and not a lack of infrastructure altogether. We talk about \"structural racism\" and \"racist police policies\" not usually about individual, interpersonal racism.  America has the problems of a developed nation that has done a lot of things right, not the problems of a failed state that has been unable to provide for the basic needs of most of its citizens.  Now lets talk about a few:  **Healthcare**  In 2020, 91.4% of people had health insurance. According to Wikipedia, of the 27.2 million uninsured under age 65:  * 4.5 million had an employer's insurance offer (making them ineligible for ACA/Obamacare coverage) but declined it; * 6.4 million were eligible for Medicaid or other public healthcare program but did not pursue it * 5.3 million were eligible for ACA/Obamacare tax credits but did not enroll in the program. * Nearly 12 million (43%) of persons were eligible for financial assistance (Medicaid or ACA subsidies) but did not enroll to obtain it.  So almost half of the uninsured have programs that are designed to help them obtain insurance, but they do not pursue it. This is barely a failure of US policy, and more a failure of individuals taking advantage of the options available to them.  As for all the bankruptcies supposedly caused by medical debt. This paper examined that, and found that:  > we estimate that hospitalizations cause only 4% of personal bankruptcies among nonelderly U.S. adults, which is an order of magnitude smaller than the previous estimates described above of it causing 60% of all bankruptcies]  Now don't get me wrong, we should try to make those 4% of bankruptcies not happen, but healthcare is much less of a problem than it would be if it caused 60% of all bankruptcies.  It's also worth pointing out that [EMTALA is the law of the land. If you go to an emergency room with a serious problem in the United States, you will be treated for it, regardless of ability to pay. Therefore, we have universal emergency health care already.  We just lack universal preventative health care. That would certainly be a good thing to pursue in the long term, but it's worth pointing out that, whatever disadvantages having employer-provided health insurance as our core form of health insurance might have (less ability to quit, be self-employed, etc.) we actually have a very good system overall.  **Inequality, and the Shrinking Middle Class**  This post talks about the problem with the shrinking middle class narrative:  > Using the \u201c0.5-1.5 of median wage\u201d definition, the middle class has indeed decreased from 53% in 1967 to 51% in 1979 to 45% in 2012. > > In \u201967, the 24-87th percentiles earned middle class incomes. In \u201979 it was 24-85. In 2012 it was 24-79. The percent of households earning below half of the median wage has not changed one iota in half a century. The median wage itself could be dropping, which would be an actual problem, but the entire \u201cdecline\u201d in the middle class is entirely caused by middle class people achieving escape velocity and becoming rich. Imagine the horror!  So, far from the American dream being over, more people are richer than ever before, and the middle class has not been shrinking due to more people being poor, but due to more people being rich.  Now look at this chart of disposable income by country. Quoting again:  > Despite wildly varying social expenditures, income-wise the US looks remarkably like a Finland or a Norway except with a bunch of millionaires added on top of everyone else (it\u2019s true that this chart doesn\u2019t account for quality of public services). Is having a bunch of millionaires in your country a good or a bad thing? Whatever it is, it\u2019s the single issue everyone in the US seems obsessed with.  The other aspect is that a lot of statistics making arguments about the American poor fail to take welfare and other cash transfers into account. When you factor those in, you get the following:  > After accounting for all income, charity, and non-cash welfare benefits like subsidized housing and food stamps, the poorest 20 percent of Americans consume more goods and services than the national averages for all people in most affluent countries. This includes the majority of countries in the prestigious Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), including its European members. In other words, if the US \u201cpoor\u201d were a nation, it would be one of the world\u2019s richest.  People underestimate how rich the United States is. Look at this Wikipedia page comparing the GDP per capita of US states vs. sovereign states. Even a poor state like Mississippi is almost as rich as the *countries* of France and the United Kingdom, and richer than Spain, Italy, Slovakia, Hungary and Russia.  And if you take PPP into account) things look even more favorable.  The United States is not a bad place to live by global standards, or even by Western European standards.", "preferred": ">In 2020, 91.4% of people had health insurance.  You presume having insurance makes everything about US healthcare OK.   One in three American families forgoes needed healthcare due to the cost last year. Almost three in ten skip prescribed medication due to cost. One in four have trouble paying a medical bill. Of those with insurance one in five have trouble paying a medical bill, and even for those with income above $100,000 14% have trouble. One in six Americans has unpaid medical debt on their credit report. 50% of all Americans fear bankruptcy due to a major health event.   My girlfriend has over $100,000 in medical debt from her son getting leukemia, after what her \"good\" insurance covered. In total, Americans are paying a quarter million dollars more for healthcare over a lifetime compared to the most expensive socialized system on earth. Half a million dollars more than countries like Canada and the UK. This is having a massive impact on everybody, whether you want to acknowledge it or not.   >It's also worth pointing out that EMTALA is the law of the land. If you go to an emergency room with a serious problem in the United States, you will be treated for it, regardless of ability to pay.

Dinosaur mummies preserve skin and other soft tissues, but how they fossilize has always been a bit of a quandry.

However, they often also appear desiccated, which usually takes long-term exposure on the landscape.

I'll just name a few of my arcade favorites: Doom, Tyrian 2000, One Must Fall 2097, Duke Nukem. I even loved alot of the flash-based games from old websites like shockwave.com, or miniclip.com; Tradewinds (1,2, and 3), Delirium - one of my favorites; an incredibly simple game, but executed SO well. I played for hours and hours.  Anyway, fast forward 20 years. PC gaming is pretty great, I love it and always will. But mobile gaming? Unbelievably bad.

If you are already close to the point where they are finding it difficult to function, your body will prevent you from exerting yourself further in order to avoid overheating.  This manifests as a feeling of fatigue.  Dehydration (which can happen from sweating) also makes this happen faster, since sweating is how your body cools itself.

Your body needs a certain amount of water to function (e.g. carry signals via dissolved electrolytes), and this gets more difficult the less hydrated you are. You sweat a lot in the sun, even imperceptively when it's dry, meaning you lose water constantly. People who are conditioned to the sun, e.g. outdoor workers, athletes have adapted to handle it better, and also to read their bodies signals and drink before they get thirsty, lessening the effect."}

{"prompt": "A question for students about \"intimidating\" professors... from an \"intimidating\" professor Hello,      I am a semi-retired (emeritus) faculty member, went into teaching early, retired early, teach Philosophy, at an R1 in America. I'm only in my mid-40's, female, although I have been teaching since my late 20's. I retired as a Full Professor and was Department Chair and ran programs. I retired mainly to pursue my academic research since it is in a subfield of applied ethics.      I teach about one class a semester now, and more and more, the students say I am \"intimidating.\" This makes no sense to me. I teach very casual seminars, care deeply about other people and often go out of my way to show this, smiling, making eye contact, knowing all of my student's names, offering individual supportive comments on their work, and spending time with students in office just chatting over coffee, sometimes with some pretty heavy situations. And in real life, I am very good-willed and good-natured too. I am academically rigorous, but this is Philosophy, which requires academic rigor, and my students are mainly upper-division Philosophy majors aside. However, there are always a smattering of General Education students here and there. I'm a very easy grader and do not give exams. Classes have a fair amount of reading due to the discipline.     It keeps coming up in my evaluations. I have literally no idea why. And because I am a logical person, it troubles me. It's not that I so much mind if students find me intimidating, but without knowing why they say this, it is strange and gives me a sense of total cognitive dissonance, especially since the other thing students commonly say is that I am \"approachable.\" I am not a very traditional academic as I spend much of my time traveling, at academic conferences, and doing service-based work.      Is there some meaning to the word \"intimidating\" that I am not clear about?     Outside of recent teaching, I have never been told this in my life. I am, like many academics, a bit mousy. It is bewildering. Perhaps the term has a new meaning? Perhaps there is some social code that I don't understand since it is new? Is this just basic gender bias against an intelligent, well-educated, middle-aged woman? I really do not understand it.", "preferred": ">but this is Philosophy, which requires academic rigor  this is probably at least part of it. rigor is intimidating to those who have not been tested - **really tested** - on what they know and how to explain and what.....they don't  I can't speak for your university or course, but grade inflation and coddling undergrads who have a minimal understanding of their discipline is an absolute thing across the board, from high to low status schools. people having their limits exposed - especially those who have been told all their life that trying hard is enough - will be intimidated!", "rejected": "My students often remark (to friendly colleagues) that I\u2019m a really hard professor. I\u2019ve talked with those colleagues and we\u2019re pretty sure what\u2019s going on is that I\u2019m the first physics prof they encounter since I teach the intro course, and the course is looking for a thought process they\u2019ve never had to use before (such as using physics concepts and math skills to build new equations, and then rigorously apply them using math skills they may have forgotten). We\u2019re pretty sure it\u2019s not about me, because I\u2019m actually more \u201chand hold-y\u201d than the other profs in the department, I grade more leniently, I have a large percentage of their grade be low-stakes/no-penalty HW, and I\u2019m just all around \u201cnicer\u201d and more patient then my colleagues. We think they don\u2019t consider my colleagues \u201chard\u201d bc by the time they get through my class and into theirs, they now know these basic physics skills.   I suspect \u201cintimidating\u201d doesn\u2019t get applied to me bc of my friendliness, (apparent) youth, and being female in a male-dominated field, but I agree with the other comment that sometimes being a woman can make students be more intimidated. *shrug* gender stereotypes can cut both ways."}
{"prompt": "AskScience AMA Series: We are Miguel and Sean and we research human eating behavior at a Harvard-affiliated lab. We\u2019re organizing an event called Hacking Eating Tracking to help develop new tools that track and quantify how people eat. AUsA! Hi there Reddit, Dr. Miguel Alonso-Alonso and Sean Manton here from the Bariatric Neuroscience Lab at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, a Harvard Medical School teaching hospital. We conduct studies on human eating behavior, some of which include neuroscience components.  One of our research focuses involves integration of modern technologies. For example, in one of our experiments we have subjects eat a buffet style meal while wearing eye-tracking glasses. In another study, we use a Microsoft Surface tabletop computer to try to automatically detect and classify bites using the infrared camera behind the screen. We also use brain scans and perform non-invasive brain stimulation.    As humans, we don\u2019t eat nutrition, we simply eat. While there is a wealth of knowledge about what constitutes a healthy diet, we still need to better understand HOW people interact with food. Most of what we know about people\u2019s eating habits comes from self-report questionnaires and methods which are decades old. Given the state of technology in 2015, we think there is huge potential for improving the objective, quanitified methods available for studying eating behavior.  Thus, we are organizing Hacking Eating Tracking, a combination of symposium and hackathon, taking place at the Harvard Northwest Building, September 18-20th.  We\u2019re bringing together an exciting lineup of the leading scientists in the field who are also working on novel methodologies to speak about their research. They\u2019ll also present what they view as the most important challenges in the field, and our hackathon participants will attempt to apply their technological prowess to develop some solutions over the weekend.  If you\u2019re interested in participating, you can apply to the hackathon, or register as a general attendee] (http://www.hackingeatingtracking.org/tickets) to watch the talks and have the chance to interact with our speakers and hackers.  Ask us anything! We\u2019ll be back around 4-5PM EDT (20-21 UTC) after a meeting to answer your questions.  P.S. Some of our hackers have expressed interest in crowdsourcing a dataset to study. If you use a fitness tracker or a food logging app of some sort and are willing to submit some of your data to help them out, please [fill out this form with your email. We\u2019re still deciding how to best collect this sort of dataset, but we\u2019ll reach out once we\u2019ve figured it out.  -----  For those who want more background on why we\u2019re throwing Hacking Eating Tracking:  **The challenge:**  Eating is one of the most complex of human behaviors.  On a daily basis we eat:  * multiple times (breakfast, lunch, dinner) * different formats of food (liquids, solids, snacks, sandwiches or full meals) * in different locations and settings (home, work, on the go, at social occasions) * influenced by a long list of factors (appetite, taste, availability, price, convenience, familiarity, sociocultural norms, ethical views or religious rules)  **The context:**  Eating behavior can be studied at multiple levels:  * individual level, reducing it to its basic components (chewing, tasting, swallowing, bites, food selections) * group/population level (family, school, neighborhood, comminity or larger group).  We are interested in finding innovative methods and tools that can help quantify and objectively assess human eating behavior to tackle one, several or all of these components.   **Why is this important?**  Finding better ways to quantify eating behavior can make data more reliable, accurate, confident, and reproducible. These improvements can benefit many areas of scientific research. Additionally, they can be very valuable to enhance our capacity to evaluate and monitor the effects of interventions in medicine and public health.", "preferred": "> While there is a wealth of knowledge about what constitutes a healthy diet,  Really?

{"prompt": "I need help understanding why was the Rutherford atomic model considered a \"fail\" My teacher (sadly I am unable to contact him in the near future for this question) compared the Rutherford atomic model with the solar system. The atomic nucleus is the sun, and the electrons are the planets.   This a.m. is thermodynamically unstable because the electrons should crush into the nucleus.  My question: Why is this the case? Why can't the electrons not crush into the nucleus as we don't smash into the sun?  &#x200B;  PS: sorry for my bad english", "preferred": "There are a couple of reasons. Firstly, you can calculate the force involved -- assuming circular motion driven by a force between two charges. Ignoring relativity for now, for a hydrogen atom you get a speed for the orbiting electron of about 1.6\\*10^(6) m/s. So far, so ok.  But the problem is that the electron is constantly accelerating, and, even in classical physics, it was understood that an accelerating charge releases energy in the form of radiation. So the electron must constantly be losing energy, implying an unstable, and in particular a rapidly decaying, orbit.  Secondly, I suppose for a larger atom with multiple electrons, the electrons themselves would be constantly exerting forces on each other. It's unclear to me what the implications of that would be, but presumably again it would be tricky to understand how such a system of rapidly-moving like charges close together could stay stable.", "rejected": "Electrons don\u2019t orbit the nucleus the same way planets orbit the sun."}

{"prompt": "CMV: It is unfair for trans women to compete in women's sports. I completely support the LGBTQ, but I feel that trans women playing in women's sports can be unfair and potentially dangerous in sports like MMA and Boxing. I understand that there are ways to change hormonal balances to even the playing field, but there are also things that cannot be changed such as bone structure. Biologically, men have advantages over women in most sports and this is the reasoning behind having separate women's leagues. With trans women playing in these sports, it can stiffen the competition for biological women. Also, there may be cases where men become trans just to play against women in the hopes of having less competition. I honestly don't know the solution to this, but I understand wanting to be inclusive towards trans women. However, I feel that allowing them to play in women's leagues is unfair.

{"prompt": "CMV: 1/6, while a historically awful event, was not the result of a planned \u201cinsurrection\u201d My main point that I\u2019m curious if my mind will be changed on is that nobody - Not Trump, Cruz, or anyone else in the Republican Party - planned on having their supporters storm the capital and harm members of Congress in order to allow Trump to remain in power.  For starters, if it was planned, what was the end goal? Does it seem reasonable that Trump actually wanted to just kill every member of Congress who opposed him, and expect to somehow retain power after that? Trump is stupid, but is he really that stupid?  On the flip side, think about how many moving parts there would have to be to pull this off. How many people would need to be in on the secret? At the very least, some of the cops, some of the protestors, some people in Trumps inner circle who helped coordinate, and probably more. If there really was a plan to storm the capital and harm political figures, how did they manage to keep it secret so well?  We\u2019re basically left with a plot that was both too stupid for anyone to attempt, and too hard for anyone other than an absolute genius to have pulled off. How is that a likely possibility of what happened?  There\u2019s been countless talk about \u201cinvestigating the events of 1/6\u201d. In my opinion, the only realistic possibility  that will be uncovered is as follows:  -Trump constantly claimed fraud. Unclear if he actually believed in fraud or was using it as an excuse.  -Trump tried to convince as many people as possible that fraud was real. This was either because he really thought he could overturn the election, to provide an excuse for his loss, or both.  -A fairly large number of people actually believed this fantasy that the election was fraudulent. As a result, some of them got rowdy at a protest and actually managed to breach the capital.  -Trump was very possibly not upset about this event.

PMP: if you have a project management group, or manage projects within your group, and your company appears to value that skill, this would be a good one to chase.  All three? The magic trifecta. If you\u2019re own company won\u2019t let you throw your hat in the ring for a higher position, another company will.  It\u2019s shallow, and you can have all three of these and still be a shitty engineer and employee.

Now that I\u2019m more financially literate, I realize the power of compounding interest and how small amounts saved earlier are so much more powerful than waiting to save large amounts later. Even $50 or $100 per month would have become tens of thousands of dollars at my age.  If anyone is interested in learning more, I highly recommend the Bogleheads wiki for great, free information on investing.

At a certain point soon after my PhD I thought maybe it would be a good idea to do some outreach in that way, but increasingly it looks like a big old waste of time. A blog might be a better idea, I have sporadically written a blog for nearly 15 years... very sporadically though. It is good to practise writing, but I don't think many people read my posts.  These questions come up a lot here, and you always get the same answers. But to add to the growing pile: network more, work with other professors and other students more. I wish I had spent those years working out how to organise my time and get into good habits."}

I'd rather not say too much about my location but in my area of KY, COVID-19 cases are bad. I'm not comfortable going to closed room for an hour or more. I should add that my employer has recommended we WFH for forseeable future as they don't want us in the office in case we risk getting people sick. I don't like the idea of risking it for an extra-curricular for work when we've been advised against coming into work.  2.) The room she wants us to do involves a \"kidnapping\" theme. We'll be placed in handcuffs and blindfolds for some trust exercises she's designed and then we'll start the escape room. I asked how long we'll be restrained for and she guessed maybe 45 minutes to an hour before the room game.   Is it just me, or is the idea of being tied up with your coworkers...very weird?

{"prompt": "[Star Wars] What was the prophecy that Qui Gon and Obi believed in? What was its origin and was it actually wrong? Where did this prophecy come from that Qui Gon believed in so strongly? Considering Anakin didnt bring balance to the force except for a brief amount of time I guess, was it incorrect? Was Rey the chosen one? Was Palpatine the chosen one?", "preferred": "The actual word for word prophecy was:  *\"A Chosen One shall come, born of no father, and through him will ultimate balance in the Force be restored.\"*  It's origins are simply an ancient Jedi mystic. It's not really clear who said it or how they came to claim it. Further, somehow from this 1 sentence it was also ascertained that the Chosen One would destroy the Sith. I think the Jedi inferred this because it's what they think will lead to balance.  Anakin Skywalker *is* the Chosen One, and he *did* fulfill the prophecy, but the Force works in strange ways, and predictions about the future made through visions from the Force are... not unreliable, but they're sort of like Genie wishes. They often don't pan out how you'd expect. Ultimate balance in the Force *was* restored, and the Sith destroyed, but that doesn't mean that the dark side is destroyed, or that there will be no more conflicts between the dark and the light. What did happen though is this: The dark side was no longer disproportionately in control of the Galaxy. The light side was no longer obstructed or clouded by the dark side. The now misshapen and bloated Jedi order was swept away.  Essentially, what the Jedi thought would happen is the Chosen One would rise through the ranks, destroy the Sith, and lead the Jedi into an era of prosperity and clear purpose once more. What ended up happening though, is that the Force was cleansed by fire. What was there could not be fixed. The Sith had too deep roots, too many back up plans, to be simply overthrown. The Jedi were too misguided, too self-righteous to ever get back on their original path.   But total destruction of both sides, now that balances the scales.", "rejected": "*A Jedi will come* *To destroy the Sith* *And bring balance to the Force.*   That\u2019s the actual prophecy, as recorded by the Great Holocron. Qui-Gon saw the strong Force presence Anakin had, and believed it was a sign that he was the Chosen One. Although Obi-Wan and Yoda later believed that his son Luke was who the prophecy spoke of-fairly reasonable, given that Vader was pretty much a full-fledged Sith at that point-its been confirmed by George Lucas that Anakin was always the Chosen One, hence him striking down Sidious.   The Sequels do screw everything up and make it out that Rey was who it spoke about all along, but the official sources say that she just \u201cmaintained\u201d the balance.

{"prompt": "Dealing with the \u201cbusy and we need help....but too busy to train you enough so you can help\u201d dilemma. How do I proceed? Few months into my new engineering job. The training process has had its ups and downs. However, as of right now my company is slammed, and I feel real bad due to the fact that I\u2019m an entry level engineer, very new, very inexperienced and overall just not great at my job. (Which I get it, that\u2019s expected for a little bit. I make efforts to improve myself daily and that\u2019s all I can really do.)  I can\u2019t really help anyone with their projects without slowing them down and it\u2019s killing me. The person training me just doesn\u2019t have a whole lot of time to spend helping me, which I don\u2019t blame him at all, but my biggest fear right now is that I\u2019m just not a value added to the company and I have no reason to be employed.

I was pretty useless my whole first year and even now I still feel like I am useless and only know just enough to get by on my responsibilities. I still have to ask others for help every step of the way.   For me, I had to take the initiative and ask anyone I could if they could teach me things. Most of the time, it was just 10 min a week. Find senior engineers/team members who can be your mentors and guides for any questions. I spent a lot of time just googling general processes and reading stuff (SOPs, manuals, specs, regulations) and walking around. Make yourself available and willing to take on any kind of work.

Its totally normal during on boarding (your first 3 months with a company) and as a new employee (your first year at a job) to be comparatively useless.  Part of your bosses job is to find you projects where this is okay, so don't feel bad.  Ask lots of questions from multiple people.  When I started my first job out of college, I had like 7 people I ran around and asked questions from.  Since I had multiple questions everyday about everything I wouldn't be quite the interruption if I was bothering multiple people.  Its part of learning, and learning how to utilizing the teams tribal knowledge is a skill and involve annoying people.  Try ask junior level employees questions they can answer so you aren't only going to senior people.  Most companies are too busy to train people, so you have to learn to train yourself.  Yes you are worrying too much in another year, you will be the one slammed with work, don't worry.  Keep your boss informed and do a good job on the work you have been provided."}

{"prompt": "How do the number of blades affect the characteristics of stand fans? I can't find a good quality resource for this. Traditionally, stand (pedestal) fans used three wide-chord (petal shaped) blades. These days I've noticed a shift towards 5 narrower blades instead. Motor power hasn't changed significantly (still on the order of 50-60W). The only subjective difference I've perceived is that at full power, a 5-bladed fan makes more of a \"buzzsaw\" sort of sound whereas a 3-blader makes a less defined whooshing sound.  Can a mechanical/aerodynamic/product design engineer explain the differences that blade count will make to a fan?", "preferred": "My guess is it's driven by marketing, not engineering. Big petal blades look old, many small blades look fancy and modern like a computer fan", "rejected": "From my understanding high blade count helps improve static pressure but that's not important for a room fan. High blade count is also noisier because you have more edges cutting the air. High blade count also cost more to make.. So i have no idea why that would be a thing for a house fan.  On the power draw side keep in mind the motor draw is not just the rated power but also includes the blade diameter, pitch, and count.  Curious to see what others say."}

I think it would end up a lot more tomato-ey than what you're looking for  It really shouldnt be a problem at all using just the barbecue sauce. If you need to thin it out add a splash of vinegar and a pinch of brown sugar + salt, maybe a squirt of ketchup and mustard. Not too much of any of that though, a little will go a long way.  Edit: Also its really not as difficult to make barbecue sauce as it seems. For the most part its ketchup, mustard, brown sugar, salt and vinegar.

I started my career as a Chemical Engineer doing exactly the same thing.  I was a batch guy, so I spent a lot of time watching batches.  Make it a point to tell the operators you are there to learn not to critique them.  Some get nervous when 'corporate' shows up and they think that they are being watched from afar.  If you have a process standard you should make it a point to go through that standard from beginning to end.  Go into the QA department, and look at all the testing.  Go into the weighing department and see how they do things.  Watch a process and check things yourself.  I always had my own temperature probe handy and a notebook to take notes.  I would offer to record the batch for the operator and ask them questions like \"why did you do it that way\".    On a side note don't be afraid to help, but NEVER start helping without offering.  This was told to me by an old-school operator that had one too many buckets spilled because someone thought he needed help.  My old boss beat into me the mantra, \"If it's not written down, it's not recorded.  If it's not recorded, it doesn't exist.\"  Your notes should be impeccable.  I once did a consulting job with a company where I was training their engineers and operators on a new process.  The young engineer came out and started freaking out because the product didn't look right to him.  He got on his phone and started googling (Don't ask me what he was googling, as this was pretty specific stuff).  I pulled the operator over and asked him, \"Does this look right?\"    \"Yeah man, it always looks like that\"  Don't be afraid of the soft skills and talking to the people that do that stuff every day.  Don't be that guy that sends emails when you can walk over and ask the question.    But, don't let the operators bullshit you either.  Sometimes their motives are self-serving and may not necessarily represent the reality the way you see it.  I once had an operator tell me that he wasn't doing anything wrong, yet the operation was clearly not working.  The product was coming out cloudy after a multi-step filtration.  So I pulled the filter press apart and noticed the pads had giant holes in them.  \"Oh yeah, if you don't do that it takes forever to filter\"  I was in the plant almost 30 years ago, and those skills still come in hand to me to this day."}
{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old: What is that temporary \"blindness\" you get when you stand up quickly after sitting or laying down for an extended period of time? Not sure if this is normal... Also is it preventable? It's very annoying", "preferred": "This is called \"Orthostatic Hypotension\". Most people have it in some degree or another, and some even faint. Tall people usually get the worst of it. It happens when your blood pools in your legs and doesn't go back to the brain fast enough, starving it of that precious oxygen. It can also happen while having bowel movements, peeing right after you wake up, standing still for long periods of time in hot, crowded places (see when teenagers pass out during boy-band concerts? Yeah, that's what it is), having your arms up for too long, or over-excerting yourself at the gym. These episodes can be countered by contracting your abdomen and exhaling strongly. Also a diet rich in sodium, and lots of water.  Not so fun fact: I knew an old guy who had heart surgery. One day he went to pee and died. His heart couldn't take it.", "rejected": "Normally when you move around, muscles in your legs assist in the venous return of blood against gravity from the lower part of your body.   When you are sitting, these don't work as hard, and blood can pool as you stand up, leading to a temporary decrease in blood pressure to the brain until those muscles get back on the job.  This can affect people to differing severity, and the severity can differ depending on how abrupt the transition is for a single person. Some people don't have any problem at all with it, some people can pass out momentarily.   Getting up slowly can usually moderate the effect."}
{"prompt": "Everything I read insists that you must rest a grilled steak for 10 min, but then the steak isn't hot when j eat it. I've experimented with tin foil the resting meat but I find it tends to further cook it, maybe even steaming it, ruining the crust I worked so hard on. Please help. Should I rest in a low temp oven, rest for less time...?", "preferred": "Rest for less time, and use a warm plate, but also, the \"rest\" is the time starting the second the steak leaves the grill and ending the second your knife hits the steak. If you pay close attention, you may find that your rest clock is starting a couple minutes after you actually pull it (once you've dealt with shutting off the grill, etc.), and that when it ends you're still gathering utensils, serving up side dishes, pouring a drink, etc. Meaning your \"10 minute\" rest has effectively become 15 or 20 minutes. I personally don't really time the rest at all - it's just the couple of minutes from the time the meat comes off the heat until I'm actually sitting down to eat it.", "rejected": "A rule of thumb is to rest it for half as long as you cook it and avoid using foil unless you are outside and it is cold. When you rest meat the crust will always get a little soggy, but it is really easy to re-crisp the steak by heating some of the leftover fat from the pan and pouring it over just before serving, alternatively if you are grilling and don't have leftover fat in the pan you can use the broiler setting on your oven for 20 seconds."}

She has a video on her instagram where she makes the cookies start to finish, if you want to follow along instead of reading her weird recipe lol  There's an alternate version of the recipe that's made with cake mix and less butter, if you want to try that instead. Also, I'm not sure how the cream cheese would affect it, but you could try to bake the cookies at a lower temperature (300F or 325F) for longer to give the cookies more time to set before spreading."}

I have fresh peaches that I want to incorporate into a birthday cake for my mother in law. I had the idea of making a dense, moist brown sugar and vanilla sponge and then laying fresh peaches and some kind of frosting between the two layers of sponge, then of course icing the outside and decorating and whatnot.   Would fresh peach slices be okay sandwiched in between two pieces of sponge?   I was thinking of making a lightly peach flavored buttercream by incorporating the juices of a peach and maybe a bit of \u201cpulp\u201d from mashing a few. Would this be too moist for buttercream? Should I make a different kind of frosting?   Interested and looking forward to hearing some thoughts and advice, thank you!!", "preferred": "I would cook the peaches down and make it into a thick jam, layered with a brown sugar Swiss meringue buttercream would be amazing!", "rejected": "You could also do a poke cake and soak the cake in peach juice!

{"prompt": "Is a Six Sigma certification worth getting for a mechanical engineer looking for their first job?", "preferred": "There aren\u2019t any nationally recognized Six Sigma courses.  Online courses cover the basic concepts and techniques, but you aren\u2019t likely to retain much of the information until you have applied it to a few projects.  Most large corporations create their own training programs and will pay for the classes.  You can get Lean certification from SME; that course is nationally recognized.  Many employers don\u2019t look for the certification, though, they look for the knowledge.  If you educate yourself on Six Sigma and Lean and can speak the language and show a good understanding of the information, you don\u2019t need to pay for any certifications.  I would recommend learning as much as you can about \u201cDesign for Manufacturing\u201d and \u201cDesign for Assembly\u201d.  I am a manufacturing engineer and often have to work with design engineers to modify their \u201cpaper-perfect\u201d designs so the product can be built in our shop.

{"prompt": "Trying to get crispy breakfast potatoes My wife has been on a huge breakfast burrito binge and we keep adding potatoes but we want to improve their exterior texture.  Insite they are coming out appropriately soft but we can seem to figure out how to get the outside nice and crispy.

I feel like it would clear the waste and everything else so why do people still die even if the dialysis is taking over the function of the kidneys or anything else?", "preferred": "The kidneys aren't just filters. That's a gross oversimplification. They are part of this complex feedback loop involving your brain, a bunch of glands, and other organs.   The easy way to look at is if you have too much or too little of something they tell your body how to react.  Too much sodium can rob liquid from your cells due to osmosis. Too little and your nervous system stops working correctly. So they have to balance how much fluid is in your body with these salts. That's just one job. They also have to help regulate other chemicals.  So just filtering is a stopgap at best. You are removing stuff from the blood that can become a problem and you can compensate for some of the rest with medications or supplements. But, part of the regulation system of the body is now gone. Dialysis is slowing the process of deteriorating functions.  Not replacing.", "rejected": "Don\u2019t you run out of veins eventually?

My understanding of how anxiety disorders are viewed by mental health professionals: total avoidance is not a successful treatment strategy. If this is some kind of documented ADA scenario, exempting a single student from speaking in public in a public speaking course is unreasonable. Don't do it.

{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old:Why can't we build an oil refinery in Canada to process the tar sands? Why does it need to be piped such a long distance?", "preferred": "Refineries are expensive. ~~Really expensive.~~ REALLY REALLY REALLY expensive.  ~~Smaller~~ Really small ones cost ~ $250.000.000; ~~Bigger~~ normal/small ones, go for around $ 1.700.000.000. German sources: (1)(2) if you need additional infastructure (pipelines, streets, electricity, ....) even more.   As comparison: the total cost of transportation of all oil transportatino done by Canadian companies is $1.300.000.000 per year source. That is less than the rice of a refinery. If you could save 10% (you won't be able to save that much!) by building a new refinary in Canada, it would take ~~10~~ 60 years to be equal. Also refinaries have high upkeep costs. So it would take even longer to break equal, I would guess ~~20~~ 120 years.  Also, the bigger the refinary, the cheaper the cost pre liter, in both construction and upkeep. So it makes sense to have a very small number of refineries.  Why is refining so expensive: You have to \"boil\" the oil and let it condense in different, exactly calculated places. Difficult enough, but oil starts to burn before it starts to boil... so it has to be compleatly without air. Crude oil is ugly, sticky, sometimes it isn't even really a liquid if you do not heat it... Crude oil comes in different types, so you have to adjust for each type. All that sounds difficult if you want to do it with very small amounts. Imagine doing it with GIGANTIC amounts.  Lastly, and probably **most important**: oil pipelines are one way only, and you can only carry one specific type of oil per pipeline. That means that you would have to build new pipelines/ships/streets to transport all the different kinds of oil that a refinary produces from crude oil. You wouldn't even be able to use the existing pipeline to transport the refined oil to the us, because that one is build to transport crude oil (and you won't refine all oil in canada).  So you would have to build and pay upkeep for even more pipelines than you have if you transport oil from canada to usa to canada.  **Short:** Oil refineries are expensive (~~1 bilion $~~ 6 billion $) and pipelines can carry only one type of oil in one direction, so you would have to build a new refinerie and several new pipelines if you want to refine in Canada.  Edit: /u/RinShiyu gave details with the capacity of refineries, turns out a refinery costs way more, about 6 billion...  Read his comment!", "rejected": "Hey all, lurker turned member here. Saw this and couldn't not put my two cents in.  I'm an LPG contractor for Calor in the UK, and I've had insight and heard a lot of details in a lot of meetings over the years.  Simple answer? Oil, as we are all so constantly reminded, is a finite resource. Why use your own when you can use other peoples first? That way, when they've ran out or newer fields become harder or more expensive to find and retrieve, you're already sat on your very own practically untapped reserve.  Here in the UK, especially where I live, we are on an absolute mountain of coal and natural gas, yet the recovery and refining is minimal. Imports, however, are the opposite. It's a case of keeping your own cards close to your chest until you need it.  Hope this helps, and hello Reddit :)  EDIT: Way to go, first post and i just realised I'd completely misread the question. Still, facts and stuff."}

There's really only two people I report two and they are both reasonable. They work with us rather than just hand down orders. * You get to do a lot more. Rather than being relegated to one little piece of a project, you get to work across the board, sometimes owning entire projects by yourself, which is great for creative freedom. * Very little hierarchy. There's pretty much engineer, and then manger, and that's it. So there's no pressure to \"climb the corporate ladder\".  Cons:  * Less organization. It's difficult to manage a lot of projects at once because we don't have any standardized way of doing so. Just verbal check-ins. * The workload can sometimes be very high to offset not having a larger team  Overall, I think I like the small company better. Even though I've never worked in a large one.

If you're applying for a role in my group with no engineering degree, I wouldn't consider you for an interview. Design engineering is more than CAD.

Certain jurisdictions may even have avenues for a non- engineering graduates to get licensed (generally need a technician or technologist diploma).  Some things you need to consider from an employers perspective:  1. It is a tough job to train engineers. There is a steep learning curve for even the best engineering graduates who have the foundational knowledge of the theory to learn the practice is engineering.  2. Hiring an entry level engineer is an investment for the company that the individual will pay off eventually. Without the engineering degree, the time until you get a ROI just increases 3.

{"prompt": "Why if I eat problematic foods do I get diarrhea so quickly after? Doesn't it take longer for the food to digest to cause issues?", "preferred": "Semi-related: Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't IBS almost like a mystery catch all thing?", "rejected": "The body gets diarrhea due to a chemical response from the stomach to the brain (from the white blood cells and other protectors that patrol your digestive system) telling your brain that the food you just consumed is either contaminated  or that you are allergic to it. Either of these scenarios sends your body into a dumping state where it tries to rid you of anything that can potentially cause you harm. While it us true that it normally takes several hours for the food to travel all the way through your body, the peristalsis reaction significantly speeds up and pushes all contents out of your digestive system as quickly as possible.  Either of these possibilities can be very harmful to your body. If it is pathogenic in nature and stays in  your digestive system it becomes more likely that the bacteria will find a way into your more delicate systems causing sickness and in some cases death. The response of diarrhea exponentially decreases those possibilities. On the other hand, allergic reaction is actually a confused signal from the body telling you that something is harmful when it actually isn't, so it is often best to just try to avoid the types of food that cause diarrhea as it can lead to very severe dehydration.  I hope that answer gives you the insight you were looking for."}

{"prompt": "Left with no alternative but to quit postdoc? My partner and I are both postdocs in well funded research institutes in similar fields - unfortunately they are both half way across the country from each other.  We have spent the last 4 years desperately trying to find positions close enough so we can live together again....and time is up. The biological clock is ticking and we should have started a family years ago.  I feel betrayed and angry with academia. Both institute have many \"happy couples\" at every level in the same building - it really feels like its just us who cannot be together. Even 2 jobs in the same city would mean the world to us.  We both have been offered contract extensions but I really don't want to take mine - why the hell should my reward for:  * Giving up every hope and dream I had - buy a house, get a dog, see my family more, start a family, have a social life. * Nearly bankrupt myself - double income means nothing if you have double bills PLUS the insane cost of travelling every weekend to the other half of the country. * Struggle to manage a research project without working weekends  Be to just do it again for another few years? There's no gratitude for the sacrifices we've made. If 2 academics with 24 years of degree/research experience between them do not deserve to live together and have basic human rights like a family, whilst still being employed - then SCREW this.   I've no desire to improve lives with research anymore after being treated like this continually and expected to be *grateful* for the opportunity.  My question for academia as a whole is:  We both are in the same position - our projects struggled to get going but are really starting to get moving now. If either of us quit now however then there is nothing to show for it (no paper, no reference etc) then it means quitting academia for good most likely?  Alternatively both our supervisors could be in a terrible position trying to salvage our work if we dropped it and walked out? What's to stop either of us laying down an ultimatum - give the other a job here or I quit. Or is this just cheap blackmail from seriously underleveraged postdocs?", "preferred": "I'm friends with a couple who each ended up with TT positions in cities that are a 5-hour drive apart.

Now he adjuncts regularly at the school his partner is at, spends a lot of time on hobbies, and seems happier than ever. I think every PhD grad, not just couples, has to think about what is most important to them and what their priorities are going to be to decide if slogging through years of contingent work is really worth it. It's unfortunate PhD students don't get more guidance on thinking through that decision. Instead academic culture implies that you should be willing to sacrifice everything else for your work. For many if us, it's just not worth it.", "rejected": "I am sorry to hear about your and your partner\u2019s struggle. Unfortunately you are far from being the only ones, I know of many people in a similar situation. In my case, my husband and I were working in academia in two different countries.

If you\u2019ve already tried that or don\u2019t want to waste more time, I guess one of you will have to quit his current position.

{"prompt": "Dumb Prank went too far (Ohio) Asking for my little sister, who isn\u2019t on reddit:  My sister was the victim of a dumb prank that went too far. Some of her buddies watched the movie *Scream*. They got one of those spooky masks and went to our house when she was home alone. One of them tapped on the window, and another rattled the door knobs. My sister didn\u2019t know who they were, so she locked herself in a room and called 911.  Anyway, the guys were still there when the police got there, and they ended up being charged with \u201cAggravated Menacing\u201d and since one of them had a real knife, there was an accelerated charge for that. Also, because my sister was 16 and all the guys were 18, it was considered child abuse??   My sister didn\u2019t want to press charges once she realized it was just her friends, but a magistrate (?) is pressing charges now. She doesn\u2019t want to testify, but they are making her.

Let her talk to the prosecutor and testify honestly, keeping it short and simple.  Yes, you can consult a lawyer about a civil suit to recover counseling costs.  I hope none of those \"friends\" is reaching out to her or threatening her, as that can be considered witness tampering.  Were they from her school?

While there would be growing pains a return of half of all life in the universe so suddenly, it could be utterly vital to the survival of countless species, both wild and civilized. Apart from suddenly having the bodies to restore supply chains, it would also restore a lot of resources that are living, like y'know ***food***.

It is, honestly quite lacking from a philosophical front but he is at least took effort on composing it, however does a rather poor job at defending it or confronting contemporaneous ideas and goes more along several long winded parenthesis\u2019s. It\u2019s ultimately a meditation on death from a suicidal person, and I haven\u2019t read most of it but seems to be mixed with bouts of very poor science, likely schizophrenia and more than a sprinkle of racism, so not something I would recommend without disclaimer.   Kierkegaard was also extremely pessimistic, however not from a metaphysical standpoint. He largely isolated himself from loved ones and friends in order to further his quest of martyrdom for Christianity although we can\u2019t say whether his pessimism was a cause or a product of this feat.   Honestly you won\u2019t find much outright pessimistic and good philosophy, presumably because philosophy is partially meant to aim and instruct how to lead a good life and anything that leads to emptying depression perhaps has made a poor judgement or at very least will be hard to garnish support.", "rejected": "Zapffe: \"surely to be counted among the bleakest thinkers of all times and places\"."}

You heart is a muscle and stronger hearts need to pump less often to move the blood around", "rejected": "Simply put with exercise your heart gets more efficient at pumping blood around your body, so when someone does regular exercise their resting heart rate is lower due to the heart not needing to work as hard to pump the same amount of blood as it would for someone who never exercises."}

{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old: Why is there such an emphasis on not consuming plastics and other harmful products rather than on their manufacture? The bottle of water (or other product) is already made and therefore it will become a waste product at some point.  Why the emphasis on not consuming it instead of pushing for the reduction of manufacture?", "preferred": "The simple answer: companies don't care, and you can't expect them to do so. Pollution is what we call an externality, something you do that affects other people without you receiving any impact of it. When externalities happen (good or bad), the market does not work well cause you are not considering what your actions cause on other people.  In this case, companies trash the environment and don't account for the fact that it harms other people. To fix this, they need to start accounting for it, by getting punished to do so. You can't expect them to turn down a bigger profit for the environment, corporations are rational, they don't have feelings. What we can expect is that if people are willing to punish them by consuming less of their product, they will start controlling themselves. Demand generates supply.  This is not really the final solution, it is more like a hotfix. The only real solution is to have an entity that oversees the efficient use of the environment, that punishes or forbids companies from misusing them. This is the role of the state. It is hard to imagine a final solution without a true democracy. Limitations to democracy like lobbies, lack of transparency and misinformed people are the real threat, not the companies.", "rejected": "Generally it is easier to sway the consumer than the manufacturer as very few large scale manufacturers will willingly lose profits making a switch in their manufacturing lines and the materials used for purely environmental reasons. However if consumers stop buying plastics then manufacturers will notice that plastic products aren\u2019t turning profits and will in turn switch to materials that consumers are willing to buy, getting the same result as pushing for manufacturers to change their products.  TL:DR it\u2019s easier to tell everyone not to consume and will get the same result in the end"}

{"prompt": "CMV: When public companies are convicted of crime (or accept a settlement) they should be disincorporated, or at least fined more than the profits they made of the criminal enterprise. Every time a company is issued a fine for criminal behavior, it's just accepted as the cost of doing business. Marginal profits are slightly diminished, or sometimes the fines are already anticipated and pre-allocated no differently than a simple bribe. What's the point of having laws at all, if the rich can just buy their way out?   The worst part is when the media describes the fines as huge, landmark, groundbreaking fines even though they still pale in comparison to the profits they enabled.   I know sometimes lawsuits can be settled without an admission of guilt, and that's just another loophole that allows white collar crime to continue unabated.", "preferred": "There are tons and tons of laws regulating corporations. They run afoul of them all the time - usually by accident, but yes, sometimes deliberately. If every fine has to be accompanied by disincorporation - in other words, the complete destruction of the company - then you don't really have fine as a punishment at all.  That's like saying that parking tickets are too small for rich people because it might be worth it for them to just park illegally and pay the fines - and that therefore, the resolution is that the penalty for illegal parking should be execution.  If parking tickets aren't doing a good enough job discouraging illegal parking, then maybe you need to tweak them a bit. But you don't need to jump straight for the maximum imaginable penalty. Same thing with corporate malfeasance.  Finally I'd like to address one other point, which is your deduction that if a corporation breaks a rule with the intention of paying a fine that this is necessarily a bad outcome. From an economic perspective, fines are indistinguishable from taxes. Just as a company may decide to continue performing a taxed activity, it may decide to continue performing a fined activity. It may very well be that the fine is set at an appropriate level - and that the fact that the corporation decides to pay the fine instead of obeying the regulation means that breaking the regulation actually does less harm to society than obeying the regulation.", "rejected": "A simple solution is to set fines as percentages of the company's ~~turnover~~ revenue. This way, the dissuasive effect is the same for all companies, no matter their size. This is also often suggested for personal fines, using a percentage of a person's income instead of a fixed amount. Apparently Finland does this to some extent.  As others have pointed out, reparation for any damage caused is distinct from and comes in addition to any punitive fines."}
{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old: Why does alcohol normally come in 750 ml and 1.5 L bottles, instead of 1L and 2L?", "preferred": "Everything I've read in this thread so far is wrong.

Thanks to their impressive naval fleet, the wine was brought from Bordeaux in 900L barrels, containing 4 225L \"barriques bordelaise\" (Bordeaux barrels), which later became the standard unit.   During the 18th century, England started mass producing glass bottles thanks to their coal, and were mesuring in gallons: 4,54609 liters. Now a little maths: a barrique bordelaise (225L) contains about 50 gallons (49.493). To make conversion easier and have round numbers, those were made into exactly 300 0.75 liters bottles. Those bottles were -and are still- sold in 6 or 12 bottle crates, containing repectively 1 or 2 british gallons.    This bottle size then stayed the norm for all kind of beverages.

{"prompt": "Why aren't you using a 3D mouse for CAD? I find use of a 3D mouse for my CAD work increases my productivity because it facilitates seamless subconscious manipulation of the 3D model.

Manipulation of the model needs to stop to select a feature or menu item. With a 3D mouse, a slight application of pressure from your non-mouse hand is all that's needed. Locking/unlocking rotation is a toggle with your thumb. With the fancier 3D mice, all sorts of functions or macros can be assigned to buttons.

All those other ticky-tacky things pop up and though I'm glad I made the switch, there's a lot more crying in the shower/screaming into pillows than I imagined.  I'd also say that there's still a lot of BS involved in this new job that I love as when I was full time at an advertising agency, it's just different kinds of BS. And I know a lot of people who were in advertising for the paycheck, wouldn't let themselves get emotionally wrapped up in it, and then go home and pursue all the things they love.

(besides baking). if it's STEM related, maybe you could do a masters in that field."}
{"prompt": "What is the secret to crispy pork skin? I've done a couple of pork roasts in my life and I feel like the end result is always different, I don't know if I should blame the pig or me for the various results.  A while back I made a pork belly roast. I wrapped it in paper wrap, then in tinfoil and put in oven for 3-4 hourse in 115 C. I took it out and removed the wrap and put in oven on 225*C for maybe 15 minutes and everything started to pop like crazy and the skin got super nice.  On sunday I made some pork knuckles. It was pre-brined, I simmrered it with a mirepoix and a rutabuga together with some all-spice and bayleaf. It was tender after perhaps 2 hours, I took it out and let it rest for an hour. Pat the skin dry and put it in oven for on 225*C for about 15 minutes. And nothing happened. The skin was just lethery. I raised the temp of the oven but that only burnt the skin.   I was so dissapointed. Next time I really want to succeed with the porkskin. What is the secret? What is it that the porkskin desired?", "preferred": "Dunk the pork in simmering water for about 10 minutes. This will gelatinise the skin.  Jab the skin all over with a jacquard, bundle of bamboo skewers, or a sharp knife. This is to put little drain holes through to the fat layer and let it run out.   Take out, drain and dry, then coat with a mix of 2 parts salt to 1 part baking powder. The salt draws out some more water and seasons the skin while a small amount of the baking powder will be drawn into the now-gelatinous skin to expand into CO2 later.   Wait about half an hour, then scrape as much of the salt mix off as possible. Rinse the rest off with cold water, then pat dry. Removing the salt and baking powder prevents overseasoning and the soapy metallic taste of too much baking powder. A quick rinse with cold water doesn't rehydrate the pork enough to matter.  Put in a hot oven (200c) to brown and crisp, or alternatively for pork belly, roast at 160c until cooked, then brown in a hot oven or broiler. Wipe the crackling occasionally if the fat is pooling anywhere.  The result is crispy light crackling that crunches perfectly when you bite it.", "rejected": "Seconding /u/coochiesandcream. You can also try basting the skin in frying hot oil. Just place the roast above a pan of 350F oil and use a ladle to pour oil all over the skin."}
{"prompt": "AskScience AMA Series: We're experts who study how wildfires affect micro- and macro-ecosystems. AUA! Wildfires in many regions are becoming more frequent and more severe.

{"prompt": "1year 5months unemployed Mechanical engineer graduate due low gpa and no relevant experience looking I graduated form a US state university last year with B.S. in mechanical engineering/aerospace concentration with a 2.784 gpa. I have applied for jobs using indeed and my school's career website. I have had 1 interview last month for a machinery and technical consultant, but i haven't heard from them. I think I screwed up my chances when I sent a thank you letter with a minor mistake-- I missed a word. I have suicidal thoughts throughout the year because most of my options (specifically grad school and entry level position) is dependent on having a good GPA or work/internship experience. I thought of going back to do a second bachelors in CS/Finance Tech but i already have 27k debt . i've done research on coding bootcamp, they seem unreliable. I worked in amazon warehouse for 6+ months at Amazon warehouse months but hated it. I was relieved when I was fired. I've thought of starting a business but with no money of viable business idea I am stuck apply for jobs. I have done a project in autonomous drones and have a little experience with python (mechies usually use MATLAB) and planning on learning about programming my any thing to with autonomous systems and AI. Where do I start and gain relevant experience to be hirable even after I do projects? I currently using cousera, udacity, Edx, ocw to learn. I would really appreciate your advice. I have also attached a copy of my resume.  https://i.redd.it/5ydzpfwmudu11.png", "preferred": "OK, long post ahead. There will be criticism but please don't take it personally. I was in a similar situation for about a year and I know how much it sucks. The suggestions are meant to try to unscrew your situation as fast as possible.  * The resume is bad. You've already gotten lots of feedback here. Try to focus more on things you've *done* rather than subjects you've learned. You barely devote a line per project. Projects need to be expanded with specific things done. Also get rid of the list of subjects: everyone has taken them. Any kind of volunteer/leadership positions you've had inside and outside of school should go in here as well. Your resume should fit the whole page.  * Did you do any side projects, not related to school? Anything neat you've done at home? Include those and expand.  * I'm mixed about the amazon warehouse job. On the one hand you don't want to look like you've done nothing for the past year, but it's an entry-level job that anyone can do. I'd probably leave it in but don't bother filling in the job description, no one will care about it.  * Use Jobscan to specifically tailor your resume for each posting. Try to put in keywords even if they aren't 100% applicable. Unfortunately most large companies use these filters to whittle down applicants so you have to game the system. Also lots of hiring managers will filter jobs based on nearby location first so they don't have to pay relocation. If you have a friend nearby the job posting, ask them if you can use their address on your resume.  * You will be asked about the gap. A lot. You need to have a credible narrative for it. I'm not advocating lying but stretching is OK. Did your family have any problems during this time that you helped with? Did you travel at all? Focus on those being at least partially the reason why you had to stay where you are and work in the warehouse at the time. Don't say \"I couldn't get a job\".  * Look at start-up incubators. These are well-connected to lots of start-ups looking for people willing to work for low salaries and long hours. Hiring is particularly hard for start-ups right now because they can't offer great salaries and the labor market is tight. Every medium to large city has them. They also usually host lots of events. Get in touch with someone there and start asking around.  * If that doesn't work, and you live near a university, ask around in the engineering departments if any professors need some part-time work done. Lots of professors need random work done but the graduate students are too busy to get to it and they can't pay a market rate(in my lab there was a high need for labview programs to control equipment and I was the only one in the building who was decent at it). The pay won't be good, but you'll at least be working and getting some experience and you can use that to get your foot in the door.  * Just to reinforce the last two bulletpoints: at this point you need *any* kind of engineering job, no matter how bad it is. A long gap like this makes you kryptonite to hiring managers, no matter the reason. Honestly at this point I'd stop applying at large companies altogether because there's better competition. They can easily get hundreds of applications per posting and you will get whittled out quickly. Focus on smaller places that likely won't even have an online application process. They might not even be listed on job sites (they will list it only on their website and not the job sites).  * Work your friends and contact lists. Every job I've ever had was through contacts. If they don't have anything now, keep them warm and ask later.  * Someone mentioned enlisting in the military. I don't have any experience with this and don't know anyone who has done this, but I imagine an engineering degree on a soldier/officer is valuable somewhere. It couldn't hurt to talk to a recruiter about it (don't believe what they say until they put it in writing on your contract though). You're extremely unlikely to see combat. After you get out the gap won't matter anymore.", "rejected": "More about yourself please. The things that you don't tell employers but they might be guessing, and the things that are shitty but real like race, overweight, age etc.   Where are you from and how willing to relocate?

{"prompt": "AskScience AMA Series: We are women scientists from the Homeward Bound expedition, recently returned from the inaugural voyage to Antarctica! Ask us anything! Hello /r/AskScience! Homeward Bound is a ground\u2010breaking leadership, strategic and science initiative and outreach for women, set against the backdrop of Antarctica. The initiative aims to heighten the influence and impact of women with a science background in order to influence policy and decision making as it shapes our planet. The inaugural 2016 voyage took place from 2 - 21 December 2016 and was the largest\u2010ever female expedition to Antarctica. We care about science, the concerns of others, and we think science can unite us towards seeing and managing the planet as our global home. **Ask us questions about our Antarctic journey, the Homeward Bound Initiative, and why it matters, especially now, for there to be gender equity in leadership. We'll be back around 2pm U.S. Eastern Standard Time to start answering!**  Answering questions today are 5 participants from the inaugural Homeward Bound expedition:  **Heidi Steltzer, Ph.D.** Heidi is an environmental scientist, an explorer, and a science communicator, sharing her passion for science with others. She is an Associate Professor at Fort Lewis College, Colorado. She studies how environmental changes affect mountain watersheds and Arctic systems and their link to our well-being. Heidi's research has been published in *Nature* and featured in the media, including the *New York Times*. Find her on social media and Medium.com @heidimountains.  **Anne Christianson** is a current PhD student in the Natural Resources Science and Management program at the University of Minnesota, researching the intersection between climate change, biodiversity conservation, and women's justice. She holds a Bachelor's degree in environmental policy from St. Olaf College and a Masters in Biodiversity, Conservation, and Management from the University of Oxford. Previously, Ms. Christianson worked in the U.S. House of Representatives writing and advising on energy and environmental legislation, for Ocean Conservancy advocating for science-based marine policy, and held the position of Vice President of DC EcoWomen, a non-profit organization working to empower women to become leaders in the environmental field. A 2016 Homeward Bound participant, Ms. Christianson was enthralled by Antarctica, and inspired by the 75 other women striving to create a global network of female change-makers.  **Dyan deNapoli** is a penguin expert, TED speaker, and author of the award-winning book, *The Great Penguin Rescue*. She lectures internationally about penguins, and is a sought-out expert on radio and TV, including appearances on BBC and CNN. A participant on the inaugural Homeward Bound expedition, she returns to Antarctica next year as a lecturer for Lindblad/National Geographic. A four-times TEDx speaker, Dyan's inspiring TED talk about saving 40,000 penguins from an oil spill can be viewed on TED.com. She is on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn as The Penguin Lady.  **Ashton Gainsford** is an evolutionary biologist and recently submitted her PhD thesis to the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University in Townsville, Australia. Her research questioned what constitutes a species, highlighting the importance of animal behavior to the outcomes of hybridization, a common and significant evolutionary phenomena where closely related species interbreed. Her research on coral reef fish using behavior and genetic tools provides novel insights into the ecology and evolution of species. She is passionate about the marine environment, women in science, and diving. She joined the Homeward Bound network in 2016 to build future collaborations and learn within a program aimed to elevate each woman's leadership abilities and capacity to influence in the future. This was highlighted in an article written for 1MillionWomen. Connect with her on twitter at @AshtonGainsford.  **Johanna Speirs, Ph.D**, is a climate scientist with specific research interests in climate variability and change, alpine hydrometeorology and Antarctic meteorology and climatology.  She works for Snowy Hydro Ltd. (a government-owned renewable energy company operating in Australia's alpine region), and specialises in understanding weather and climate processes that effect water resources in the Australian Alps. Johanna maintains an affiliation with the University of Queensland's Climate Research Group following her PhD on Antarctic meteorology and climatology. She wants to live in a world where quality science is used to make more informed decisions in the way this planet is managed. She thinks Homeward Bound is a pretty inspiring initiative to help get more women to the decision-making table.

{"prompt": "CMV: As long as they're both in the same, non-unlimited weight class, men and women should be allowed to compete against each other in combat sports. Combat sports such as mixed-martial-arts and boxing shouldn't allow gender segregation. The only acceptable segregation should be by weight class.  In these sports, the highest weight class is \"Heavyweight\", which has no upper limit. Men have significant advantages over women in reaching large sizes, and unless an unusually large woman decided to enter the fight game as a career choice, I don't see it happening.  But, every weight class below that has rigid maximum requirements, either you weigh X or less, or you don't compete. If one competitor is allowed to bring significantly more mass into the fight, it's an unfair advantage.  There's room for variety in this. A taller competitor at one weight class must be leaner and have less muscle mass than an opponent at the same weight. A tall fighter must have a different fighting strategy than a short fighter. The tall fighter will have a reach advantage, and the short one will have more power.   I've had this discussion before with others, male and female, and I got three contrarian points:  * Women have more dead mass than men do, mainly breast tissue. I've got no reply to that in normal cases, but these are professional fighters. Body fat levels, which closely relates to breast tissue size, are very low.   * Men would have other advantages not related to body mass...how? It's not like a pound of male muscle is stronger than a pound of female muscle. I have read where men are generally capable of faster reaction times. I say again that these men and women are fighters, if their reaction times were \"average\" or worse they shouldn't be in the ring. Even if one fighter's reactions are \"great\" and the other's are \"good\", that's no reason to cancel the fight.  * Segregation by gender roles is just commonly accepted and no one would watch the fight. I think there's some truth to that...until the women win a match or two. After that...gender identity in 2016? People will care about it.  _____  > *Hello, users of CMV!

This is well proven in studies. Men have a higher ratio of fast-twitch muscle fibers which translates directly to strength.", "rejected": "Have you considered that female fighters might not want this for noncompetitive reasons? With two separate leagues, there is effectively more opportunities for just women to get into the spotlight and make a career of fighting. If they have a league  for just women then women have a better chance of being seen in a male dominated area. The alternative would be that women get ousted by more competitive men and that career potential lowers substantially. What's more, there is nothing wrong with wanting to watch high end male on male, female on female fights. There are different dynamics that can be present in both that will not be present in a mixed setting."}

There also is an ad hoc body, on which I sit, that hears students complaints on all such matters.  Most of the time, it is a 2 way street to TBF.  The student is not really up to snuff as far as graduating, but the PI really should and could do more to focus them and get them on track.  Some of the time it is the PI trying to get out one more paper, or whatever.  Of these times, the PI often is genuinely shocked that their view that the student wouldn\u2019t want to spend X more time to get a high impact paper is not also the choice of the student.

I will be here from 12:00pm - 2:00pm PST (15 ET,20 UTC) to answer your questions\u2026AMA!", "preferred": "In 2011 I visited Magdalena island to walk amongst the penguin colony there. While most of the penguins seemed pretty chilled out there was this one who waddled up to me, and latched onto the leg of my pants with its beak. It then shook its head from side to side, similar to how a dog shakes a toy, whilst simultaneously slapping my leg with its wing. It kept this up for a couple seconds until it left me alone only to waddle up to the person next to me and repeat the process.  I have struggled to come up to a reason why this penguin was doing this. This was sometime in December and there were chicks with their fluffy feathers around yet other (presumably mothers) didn't seem to mind us walking by them which to me rules out that this penguin was trying to protect its young.   Would you happen to know what might motivate a Magellanic penguin to do this?", "rejected": "Why are penguins so clumsy?"}
{"prompt": "How is it that the standard time for a PhD in Germany is 3 years whereas in the US it can be as long as 10 years? Are they treated equally?", "preferred": "The only people who say that a long PhD is worth more are people who do long PhDs. Ultimately do your PhD and GTFO - it's not the last thing you do, but rather should be the first thing you do.", "rejected": "I took 8 years to get a PhD in art history because I worked full time in museums (curator then director) while writing my dissertation. I was a candidate after 2 years of course work and another year for qualifying exams, dissertation proposal and foriegn language requirements. 5 years to write my dissertation was not my plan but I was glad it was an option as I needed to work full time to support my family. So I didn't get screwed, I just took advantage of the time table that was available to me. I moved all across America during those 5 years. No regrets."}
{"prompt": "Dear academics, what are the worst press articles about scientific studies you've ever read ?", "preferred": "Any scientific press release or announcement that contains the words \"cure\" or \"revolutionize.\"  Sure, occasionally a medical breakthrough does cure something, and occasionally a scientific discovery truly does unleash a revolution in human understanding.  However, 99.9999999% of science proceeds incrementally, so words like \"cure\" and \"revolutionize\" almost always indicate exaggeration and hype.", "rejected": "All of them.  The press does a terrible job of disseminating any scientific study because they are writing it at a 5th grade level and summing it up in 500 words."}

Any advice is welcome.", "preferred": "Bake bread!  It\u2019s the cheapest baked good and requires very few tools (honestly, you don\u2019t really need much but a bowl, kitchen towel, and a wooden spoon to start out).  And if you get good at it, you can give it away as gifts - people looove a good homemade, crusty loaf!  Any breakfast items as well, really: biscuits, pastries, cinnamon rolls. Even croissants are relatively inexpensive to make and don\u2019t require fancy tools. In a pinch I\u2019ll use a wine bottle as a rolling pin!", "rejected": "Most baking can be made by hand. Try focaccia. If you like it, you can look into sourdough focaccia. Toppings; anything you fancy - try just rosemary and salt to start. I usually add thinly sliced garlic to that, and/or thinly sliced olives, chopped up sun-dried tomatoes. You can try meats, other herbs and spices. Main thing is to let the dough rise."}
{"prompt": "CMV: \"Healthcare can't be a right because then doctors would be made slaves\" is a ridiculous argument (Note, you can replace \"healthcare\" with basically any other social program or facility, be it education, housing, food etc, the healthcare bit is not the important bit, just one example where this argument is made)  **Argument I see made:**   If healthcare is a human right, that means the government **has** to give it to you, which means if no doctors wanted to work (or not enough doctors), the government would have to **force** a doctor to treat you, which is **slavery**.   **My issue with this argument**:   There are many, for one, it's solved incredibly easily by just saying \"rights can't violate other rights\" or something, isn't that literally already in the Bill of Rights in the US?   For two, this doesn't seem to happen with any other rights, you could justify a lot of horrible shit with something like the right to life, or right not to be tortured. Should we tap the phone of every single person all the time in order to stop any possible rights violation happening to someone? Well no of course not, that would violate other rights, so we understand it's not a good response to the argument.   For three, there are countries with national healthcare systems where doctors are not enslaved.   And for four, \"human rights\" are just goals we try to reach, no human right is 100% achieved, people still get murdered, tortured, enslaved, sometimes by the government in cases like George Floyd, it's not like there is some magic force compelling us to push for these rights with 100% of the power we could, I think if healthcare was a right, and we ran out of doctors, people would be understanding to the government saying \"sorry we can't help there literally are 0 doctors left they are all busy\". I find it unlikely in this scenario people would start rioting to get the doctors enslaved to help more people or whatever.   **Disclaimer about my own beliefs on this matter:**   Personally I do dislike sayings like \"healthcare is a human right\". For one it's wrong, it's not (talking US here mainly), the proper statement would be \"healthcare *should be* a human right\", but even that I don't like as it leads to dumb arguments like this, and people get really nitpicky about \"positive vs negative rights\".   Nothing *is* a right inherently, we just all agree some things should be guaranteed (like not being tortured or enslaved) so we make them rights. \"universal healthcare\" means the same thing as \"healthcare as a human right\" and just sounds less strange as an argument and stops a lot of weird responses like the one I'm against here. Anything could be a right if we want it to be, but we don't have to call everything we want people to have universal access to, a right. So I'm not super attached to the saying \"healthcare is/should be a human right\", I just think this response to it is very stupid and find it surprising it comes up so often.", "preferred": "A \\*right\\* can not require the resources of another person.  You can not legally require resources of one person to another.  I don't mean that in an idealic sense.  I mean that in a legal sense.  In the court room.  In order for it to be a right, it must be defended in a court of law each time it comes up.  Because resources can not be a legal guarantee, it can not be defended in a court room.  Rights are legally upheld.  You can not legally force A PERSON to fulfil a litigation any time it arises.", "rejected": "This is just a classic clash of definitions. A right in the classical liberal sense is a negative right: something you're born with that can't be taken away. The argument being made on the other side is that if we treat positive rights the same as negative rights, then that creates a contradiction where other people can violate your rights by not actively serving you."}

{"prompt": "Is pregnancy between the ages of 35 and 40 really a considerably higher risk? I've always heard that pregnancy over ages 35 (often called  Advanced Maternal Age) is significantly more dangerous for both the woman and the baby, due to the higher risks of miscarriages, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes and decrease in fertility rates (as said here, here and here, for example). But, I watched this video, from \"Adam Ruins Everything\", which provides evidence that the risks of getting pregnant between the ages of 35 and 40 don't increase as much as warned by the majority of doctors.  So, what's the truth about pregnancy after 35? If women could have babies until they were 40 without taking any more risks, it would be better to their careers.", "preferred": "To answer your literal question: risk is higher with age, but not considerably. Risks for the embryo (mostly genetic, because of lifetime exposure from parents), and risks for the mother with an older body (as would be to start a new sport with older age, risk of lesions and/or cardiovascular increases).  Take into account that is not the same if it's the first pregnacy or a second or more. First pregnancies have higher risk also.  Finally for the individual woman age is a fixed variable, you can not choose or change your age. What you can change is the care during the pregnancy, according to risks.", "rejected": "Pregnancy after 30-35+ also increases risk of certain developmental defects such as aneuploidy related conditions (where the number of chromosomes in the fetus is abnormal) like down syndrome (3 copies of chromosome 21 instead of the normal 2). Most aneuploidy events are incompatible with life and lead to a miscarriage, since its vital to have the proper number of most of our chromosomes. One leading hypothesis as to why this occurs is because women develop all of their egg cells in utero while they themselves are a fetus, and these cells are 'frozen' in a specific stage of their cell cycle until they are selected to be ovulated. Due to this, the proteins which hold those cells together are believed to degrade/lose functionality in key regions after 35+ years in the ovary which may lead to improper chromosome segregation prior to fertilization.

{"prompt": "[Economics] How true are these statements about the US economy and the Federal Reserve?

Only god can make something out of nothing. Fiat currencies a prone to inflation and hyper inflation. Money needs\ufeff to be an I owe you for gold, not gold itself.", "preferred": "As a libertarian, let me try to qualify some of these statements, at risk of adding some sort of balance to this discussion.  >It does not take a genius to\ufeff figure out the the Fed is bad, and benefits only the elite.  To understand why central banking and fractional reserve lending are bad requires a good understanding of Austrian Business Cycle Theory.  In a nutshell, artificial credit causes entrepreneurs to over-invest in capital goods because interest rates do not reflect the actual preference of consumers to save for the future.  These malinvestments are revealed in the bust phase of the boom-bust cycle.  A central bank doesn't \"smooth out\" business cycles, it exacerbates and enlarges them by providing even more fuel for the bubble phase.  There's a lot of resources out there about this, I'm sure they do a better job than I can.  >America, after the first central bank was abolished, ...  It is true Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson were staunch opponents against central banking.  They had seen the levels of debt the Bank of England had run up, and were committed to not inflicting the same thing to America.  Regarding the actual history of events surrounding the Federal Reserve Act, it was shady passage indeed.  A good book about the Federal Reserve's creation is The Creature From Jekyl Island.  >Gold is real wealth, not theoretical wealth  These are pretty vague terms.  It's better to say that gold is a better store of value than fiat paper, but it is not a better medium of exchange.    >Any Fiat currency is mathematically bound to\ufeff collapse  I haven't seen a \"mathematical\" proof to this one.  What is \"mathematically true\" is that our debt-based fiat system *requires* an exponentially increasing money supply.  That might be as benign as 2% nominal inflation, or as bad as hyperinflation.  It's up to the central bank's management of the money supply.  However, the system is not stable under 0% inflation or any amount of deflation.  If you also consider Cantillon effects of inflation, that is its tendency to distort the economy toward the sources of the new money (i.e. politically connected and financial sector), then wealth will concentrate in the those sectors and starve the real economy of resources.  If the central bank follows this with even more credit creation, as it is doing now with ZIRP and QE, we might conclude that the system is indeed headed for inevitable collapse.  Not surprisingly, ZIRP and QE have so far failed to restore unemployment to pre-2008 levels.  But in any case, this is not a mathematical \"proof\" of collapse, it's just an argument that central bank policy doesn't work.  >A nations wealth should be determined by it's value in resources, trade and business worth, not by the regulations of a central bank. Only god can make something out of nothing. Fiat currencies a prone to inflation and hyper inflation. Money needs\ufeff to be an I owe you for gold, not gold itself.  This is a bunch of nonsense.  What *is* true that he hints at is that hyperinflation cannot happen *without* a central bank.  So gold, if nothing else, is at least a protection against hyperinflation.", "rejected": "Economies have had boom and bust cycles way before the creation of any central bank. The FED's job (among other things) is to make sure that those bust cycles aren't as bad as they could potentially be. Had the fed not acted as it did in 2008, we would have faced soup kitchen lines longer than the ones during the Great Depression. Having an independent, stable central bank is a social good.   The world runs on fractional reserve banking and that's a good thing! It stimulates the economy and increases growth and wealth. Now, you may argue that it creates money out of nowhere, but what it actually brings about is deflation. This means that your money now has more buying power than it did before. A little inflation is good because it encourages spending instead of sitting on your pile of money, it also makes sure that there isn't too much deflation; too much of either one is a bad thing.  As for the gold standard: gold is, in itself, a commodity. That means it's worth as much as laws of supply and demand say it's worth. It's subject to bubbles driven by what people are willing to pay for it. But it's a bad currency because, simply, it's completely detached from output. Here's a simple model for understanding why. Imagine a closed economy with 100 people and a fixed supply of gold. Say output over 25 years doubles (a perfectly reasonable assumption if that economy grows 3% annually), but the supply of gold stays fixed. Now you've got twice as much output chasing the same amount of gold, so prices deflate (by half). Wages do the same thing. Now imagine for a second that you took out a loan in year 1 for 5 pounds of gold. Now, in year 25, the nominal value of your principal is the same, but the real value of the loan is double, plus interest. Given that kind of deflation, no one's going to be too willing to borrow in gold. Instead, they'll spend as little of their gold as possible and sit on it, waiting for it to appreciate. But if everyone's doing that, then where does the demand for goods and services come from? The simple answer is: from nowhere. Instead the gold standard discourages credit, depresses demand, and makes the money supply contingent on something as random and unpredictable as the amount of gold that is mined in a given year.  Central banks like the Fed do away with that problem by tethering the supply of credit to the output of the economy. If output goes up 3%, the money supply should roughly keep up. If extra credit is needed to stave off a panic, the Fed can provide liquidity (like it did in 1987 and 2008). If there's too much credit swirling around and too much money chasing too few goods and services, the Fed can cut the supply of credit by raising interest rates (like Paul Volcker did in the early 80's). Can the Fed screw up? Of course. It's run by people, but compared with the vagaries of the gold standard, it's an infinitely better approach.  Edit: Spelling.  Edit2: Could the libertarian downvote brigade explain why I'm being downvoted?"}

{"prompt": "CMV: No matter the situation, people seem to all be inherently hostile and accusatory. Heya everyone, I admit this may or may not count as a proper \"view\" but I wanted to give it a shot here anyway because its been bothering me more and more as I see more instances of it.               To describe it breifly, it seems that everywhere I go, everywhere I look, there are always people being extremely hostile and accusing others of being certain things when to me it seems that there is nothing that justifies that level of reaction. If it was limited to a couple small instances, I could dismiss it as just a loud minority, but it happens so much that it really feels like at least 50% of everyone is like this.             Its one thing to respond with hostility when someone else says or does something that is clearly malicious, bigoted, etc.... but the cases that bother me are not that at all. A lot of the times the so called \"Bigot\", \"Coward\", \"Ignorant person\" etc is just a normal person trying to ask a genuine question or hold a normal conversation.           For example, I saw someone ask for advice on how to handle their roommate who was mistreating their cat, and I could tell that OP was genuinely trying to get help, and one of the top comments was someone accusing OP of neglect because they didnt immediately go in fire and brimstone on their roomate. It just feels so needless and aggressive, and by virtue of it being one of the top comments it is clearly a popular view.                   Another time, I saw a thread made in response to ab image where a woman on twitter says \"90% of women are pretty and 90% of men are ugly. Sorry.\" and a guy responds with \"We are both in the 10%\"            Seems pretty ok so far. The woman made a baseless and rude claim so someone responded with disapproval. The comments in the thread, though... were filled with people trying to genuinely justify what the woman said with stuff like \"Yeah most men are pigs who dont clean themselves etc etc\" which then sparks more arguments which then turned the thread into a hellhole. I saw that in the morning and it just left me feeling quite dejected for the rest of the day.                  I know that the stories Im giving are a bit anecdotal, but I hope it gives you a clearer idea of what Im bothered by. These are just recent examples of a trend that I have been seeing for as long as I have had the internet. I just... dont really understand why everyone is so aggressive and hostile. Maybe I am still young and kinda naive (Just turned 19) but it just really bothers me and honestly makes me hesitant to tell people about my worldviews or anything even remotely controversial out of fear that I will become the next punching bag.            Besides that, seeing all these heated arguments spring up where I think stuff could have easily been discussed normally or even not needed to be talked about at all really bothers me. I dunno why, I know it has nothing to do with me, but seeing it still makes me feel so... sad?               If this really is just how people are, thats alright. I'd be quite dejected and perhaps lose some of my faith in humanity, but I can still live normally. I'd just be very selective with who I talk and open up to.

{"prompt": "[Wednesday] Where do the Addams families moralities fall? I just finished the new Wednesday Addams show on Netflix, and I\u2019m a bit confused by what the Addams consider morally right vs wrong.   For example Wednesday spends a lot of the show trying to solve the murders and prevent the destruction of the school, yet she attempted to kill a pool full of highscool boys in the first 10 minutes.   Or how the family and others view Gomez killing the other student. Even the family members seem as if they don\u2019t want to kill people and that the students murder is wrong, yet the dad seems disappointed that nobody thought he was capable of committing murder in the first place.   So I guess my question is, is there a consistent set of morales the Addams family has?", "preferred": "The Addams have a morality based on what they can survive. Uncle Fester survives more electric shocks than a typical human would, Wednesday enjoys being tortured, Morticia keeps carnivorous plants that nibble people who don't establish dominance, and so on. They simply have the naivety to believe that everyone can survive what they do.  Using that as a basis, Wednesday was just tormenting the boys at the start of the series as retribution for bullying her brother. Every one of them was a highly experienced swimmer who saw her approaching. The only one who failed to escape the piranha was the one who was too stupid to know to run. She may claim murderous intent afterwards, but she did something that every member of her family would have survived.  In contrast, stabbings, falling gargoyles, and monster attacks would be fatal to an Addams so are known by them to be wrong.  As for Gomez wanting to be thought of as capable of murder, not even being considered capable of it is him being told that his family believes that when the chips are down he would probably let them die rather than do what is needed. Being such a loving man who cherishes those he holds dear and wants to do right by them, that would hurt. It's not even machismo. It's just wanting his family to think that he would be there for them.  So in the end, their morality is based on their experiences and beliefs as everyone else's is.

{"prompt": "CMV: Auto Insurance should be required to cover the full amount of medical bills of crash victims up to about $8 Million. In most US states, auto insurance is required to pay out $25,000 to crash victims. This is a ridiculously small amount, considering the cost of healthcare in the US. According to the CDC, crash injuries in 2012 resulted in a total of $18 Billion in medical costs.\u00a0   $25,000 is also a very low valuation for a human life. According to a few US government offices, the value of a human life is somewhere between $7 Million and $10 Million. I don\u2019t think that these numbers are sacrosanct; I am completely open to any valuation that\u2019s within a factor of 10 of one of them.\u00a0   In Denmark, auto insurance is required to cover 121 Million Krone, which is about $16 Million.

It will help to cover expenses for a family that has lost the income of an earner. It will also force insurers and drivers to care about preventing traffic deaths.   The obvious downside of this policy change is that driving would become more expensive, and some people will be priced out of it. However, the increase for most drivers would be relatively small. There are [228.2 Million licensed drivers in the US. There are about 40,000 traffic deaths each year in the US; at a valuation of $8 million per person, those would cost $320 Billion. The average cost per licensed driver would be (320 Billion + 18 Billion) / 228.2 Million = $1481.16 per year.\u00a0   The insurance companies already know which cars are relatively safe and dangerous, and which drivers are relatively safe and dangerous. If a dangerous driver has had a couple of DUIs and a bunch of moving violations, their premiums should reflect their probability of killing or injuring a human being whose life is worth $8,000,000.

{"prompt": "How do you grate cheese? I always get cheese all over the counter, and my shoulder is usually sore before I'm done. I'm fairly sure my technique is off. Help? I have a rectangular cheese grater with a handle on it.  The 1/2 of the grater closer to the handle has larger holes, then there's a long slicer thing in the middle, then small holes at the end furthest from the handle.    I like to make home-made mac & cheese with a pound of freshly shredded cheddar.  I've tried using the bags of shredded cheddar, but the flavor or the melt is always off.  For some reason, it has to be freshly shredded.  (I'm open to suggestions of how to make it not suck with pre-shredded cheddar, though.)  That being said, my technique for shredding the cheese is evidently terrible.   I put a cutting board down on the counter (to act as a mobile platform for moving shredded cheese).  I then put the end of the cheese grater at the far end of the cutting board (for support), such that the handle of the cheese grater (in my hand) hovers above the other end of the cutting board, the purpose being that the cheese that drops out of the grater lands *on* the cutting board.  Once the level of grated cheese is as high as the level of the grater, I scrape it off into a bowl until I'm ready to start its melting, a movement that's much easier when scraping from the cutting board.   I have a few problems, though.    The blocks of cheddar that I'm shredding/grating are approximately the same width as the grater.  When I'm sliding the cheese across the grater, if I go perpendicular to the grater, the block of cheese inevitably crosses over onto the slicer thing in the middle.  If I go parallel to the grater, I get very, very small shreds and have to shred hundreds of times to get the block grated all the way.  So, how do I grate the cheese in the most efficient manner vis-a-vis size and angle?  In addition, I somehow end up with cheese shreds that land a foot away from the grater.  I'm not violently flinging the block of cheese, nor am I gesticulating with the grater, so how the hell do these little strips of cheese end up all over the counter?  More importantly, how can I prevent cheese from flying all over the place?  Lastly, though probably a consequence of the first problem, I invariably get a sore shoulder (left, the hand holding the handle of the grater) from grating this pound of cheese, and my forearm gets tired, too (right, the hand holding/sliding the cheese).    Obviously, I'm doing something wrong, but what?  And how can I improve my cheese-grating technique?  Feel free to ask any questions if something up there's not clear enough.   **TL;DR** I suck at grating cheese; help me become better?", "preferred": "I use a good-quality (i.e., chromed) box grater so the cheese (or chocolate, or whatever) ends up inside.

Rovelli is kind of a big name in his field, but outside that not many people know about him for anything but a couple of popular science books.

When I first applied for aero, I was also considering mechanical but decided against it mainly because the course was more competitive (also slightly higher entry requirements), and I wasn't so sure about the design side of it.

Similarly, I think a lot of people will look at that degree and think, oh, Aero, they'll want more money, or they'll move on after a year because they're looking for something more.

{"prompt": "CMV: Most people hate cats for irrational and trendy reasons. I'm a cat person so you know where my bias is heading. Often times I here people say they hate cats but I've never heard really any good reason to hate cats. The only one I can really understand is that they're allergic. But other than that, cats are pretty easy to maintain and take care of especially compared to dogs. Whenever someone says they hate cats they always use vague terms like, \"cats are evil\", or \"cats are just mean\". I think what people don't understand is that cats don't love unconditionally like dogs do. From my experience if you treat a cat with love and take care of it as you should cats can be the most love able creatures on the planet. With dogs however, you could literally be abusive to a dog as long as you feed it it'll still obey your command.  That's why I think majority of people say they hate cats. Because cats aren't going to blindly follow all your commands like a dog would so therefore they aren't as programmable as dogs if that makes sense. Each cat has its own unique personality and what it likes.  Cats also don't attack people like dogs do cats for the most part just mind their own business and don't require much attention. Cats are much more hygienic than dogs, cats don't bark all the time and disturb people, cats overall don't really bother anyone.

He is on my side and maybe he could help or contact someone for me, but I don't want to get him in trouble because maybe my parents will do something bad to him to, beat him, etc. I am able to make this post because I have an old iphone of my dad's, he doesn't know I have it. There is no service, only I'm connected to wifi. If anyone finds it they will take it away and I will be truly alone. I have to be careful.   Someone please tell me what I can do.

With the collapse of communism, people have come to dismiss Marx as an irrelevance, but this is wrong. I don\u2019t have much time for Marx\u2019s utopian vision of socialism nor his labour theory of value, but his understanding of capitalism was superior in many ways to those of the self-appointed advocates of capitalism. For example, when free-market economists were mostly against limited liability companies, Marx saw it as an institution that will take capitalism on to another plane (to take it eventually to socialism, in his mistaken view). In my view, 150 years after he wrote it, his analysis of the evolution of labour regulation in Britain in Capital vol. 1 still remains one of the best on the subject. Marx also understood the centrality of the interaction between technologies (or what he called the forces of production) and institutions (or what he called the relations of production), which other economic schools have only recently started to grapple with.  http://hajoonchang.net/economists-who-have-influenced-me/", "rejected": "I suggest Economics as Ideology to get a better picture of where the field of economics is today.

{"prompt": "Will real-time FEA/CFD solvers eliminate the need for dedicated simulation engineering roles? For some context, I'm a mechanical engineering student who will be graduating in a year and have been starting to narrow down what area of engineering I would like to go into.  I was starting to think engineering analysis would be it.  FEA, CFD, that sort of thing.  This article on engineering.com, however, has me a bit worried.  It describes ANSYS's new real-time solver, which is admittedly pretty cool, but seemingly does away with the need for an engineering analysis department.  Obviously its not that simple, but as I'm trying to plan the trajectory for a 30-40 year career, I  can't help but worry about what the emergence of real-time solvers means for engineering analysis departments.  I don't want to start pursuing something that will  be obsolete in 10 years.  So my question for you all is: do you think real-time solvers will replace traditional engineering analysis roles?  My reading into FEA and CFD is that they require a lot more than just defining your loads and pressing a button, but as simulation tools become more and more advanced, do you see the need for engineering analysts and dedicated FEA/CFD engineers going away?", "preferred": "No, not anytime soon. Discovery live is basically all marketing right now from what I\u2019ve seen. It looks cool and impresses people who aren\u2019t familiar with FEA or CFD, but it is literally nothing more than colorful fluid dynamics that serious analysis software users aren\u2019t going to use as is.  For example, last I checked, the FEA solver would just assume everything to be bonded. Results are different while using different GPUs due to the fidelity. No idea what turbulence model the CFD solver uses. All this stuff is literally hidden despite being important decisions for the users while setting up an analysis model. And that\u2019s the problem, it\u2019s practically garbage in garbage out by design.   I\u2019m sure it\u2019s tempting to a lot of non technical managers who are expecting designers who aren\u2019t trained in FEA/CFD to push a few buttons and get meaningful results.

I am looking for the perspectives of academics.  I have a complex medical history, and I take multiple medications to manage my health. The university are aware of this. In 2015, the police caught me at the airport in Australia headed for the UK with opioids. I had a prescription, but it wasn't on me. They charged me with unlawful possession of a controlled substance. I went to court with a lawyer, and the charge was withdrawn.  When I applied to become a provisional psychologist, my application was significantly delayed because I had to declare my medical history, incase it was considered an 'impairment'. They were not, however, concerned by my criminal history once they understood the circumstances. I am now a registered provisional psychologist.  I also applied for a Working With Children Check in October last year. They wrote to me and asked me to explain the charges. They said I had no proof that I had a prescription, so they were going to reject my application, but my lawyer and I decided to hire a forensic psychiatrist. He wrote to them, and said I am no risk to children, and I sometimes take opioids to manage severe pain, but I am not addicted to opioids. We sent the report in July, and have not heard from them since.  The university have forgotten about the WWCC, and have organised a placement as a provisional psychologist. I contacted my lawyer, and she said it is illegal for me to commence the placement. WWCC are not answerable to anyone, and are unwilling to provide a timeline.  I think I need to tell the university, but I am nervous. I am worried they will think I am addicted to opioids. I am worried they will think I am lying about my criminal history - because, really, how are opioids related to working with children? I am also worried they will think the reason my registration took so long to process was because of my history. Ultimately, I am worried I will lose my place in the course.  What are your thoughts?

Tongs will help with this, and you can even use chopsticks. Grab noodles, do a bit of a shake, then drop them back down. Keep picking up clumps of noodles along with other items then drop them back in. This does 2 things: 1. breaks the noodles apart and 2. Mixes the ingredients into the individual noodles.  Stirring noodles leads to exactly the situation you described.

Full details at the link, but I'll try to summarise.  It looks at the absolute minimum energy required to make a single bit state change in an ideal computer - not something that practically exists. We can approximately assume that each change increments our counter by one (technically, you'd need multiple bit changes for carries, but we can ignore that since the numbers are absurdly large anyway).  The conclusion is that all the energy released by a supernova (minus neutrinos) would be enough to count 2^219 values. That is approximately 10^85 values.  Therefore, you would need the energy of approximately 10^15 or a quadrillion supernovae to count to 10^100, or a googol, at an absolute minimum with a theoretical ideal computer.  We can consider that completely impossible within any known or even most assumed possible computers.  And all those are just for a googol. A googolplex is 10^(10^100) (10\\^(10\\^100) if it's not rendering correctly), so much higher than 10^100 I'm not sure how to express the difference."}

Am I living in fear because I brush my teeth everyday and floss a few times a week? Am I living in fear because have a smoke detector and a fire extinguisher in my house?

Am I living in fear because I get blood work done at the doctor every couple years? Am I living in fear because I wear shoes when walking around town? Am I living in fear because I where a helmet when I ride my bike?  Idk. I really don't. I'm just trying to live life. I'm not holed up in my home surrounded by hand sanitizer and jars of piss. I just want to put a piece of cloth over my mouth AND NOSE. It's actually really nice in the winter for staying warm and in the summer it's not as bad as people try to make it out to be.  I'll tell you one way I definitely don't live in fear. I don't keep a gun in my house or walk around strapped 24/7. Is wearing a mask more \"living in fear\" than people who are armed to the nines just in case they get attacked? (Something millions of Americans do.)  And guess what, all the things I mentioned that I do to keep myself and my loved ones safe have strong empirical evidence to support that they make you a safer person and increase the chance that I can live a long healthy life. Gun ownership, however, greatly increases the probability that you or a loved one gets shot.  I'm just try to have a common sense routine that keeps me safe. It really doesn't interfere with my life. I go to work, I go to the store, I hang out with friends and I have like 4 or 5 concert tickets already bought for this summer and fall. I just do some of those things with one more article of clothing than I use to  It makes me think about an old joke line about George W Bush. 'George Bush believes on Wednesday the same thing he believed in Monday no matter what happened on Tuesday.'  Something happened last year. And it was awful. If that doesnt make you want to change something I don't know what to tell you.  Flu deaths were down by an order of magnitude. Masks save lives, full stop.  Imagine if we already had, say, 70% of the population wearing masks casually out in crowded public space before covid started to spread. Imagine if most people already had a personal store of masks in their house before this started so that they were prepared to mask up immediately. It might not have gotten off the ground at all.  Plus its fashion. It's another way to Express yourself. They can be colorful and fun.  WHEN the next pandemic comes and we handle it better than covid it's going to be because of people like me. Wearing a mask is more effective at stopping me from spreading my germs to others than it is at keeping germs off me anyway. So it's more of a common courtesy to others than it is me being afraid.  Wear a mask save a life. That's it. That's not living in fear. It's just applying common sense health practices to your routine", "preferred": ">Wear a mask save a life. That's it.

For my brand of choice, I've gone 10-15 minutes longer - almost twice the listed bake time! But it works.

{"prompt": "Update on Robbie from Cherri Good morning. My name is Cherri. I was Robbie's volunteer doula with the hospice program. I am posting here to honor his wishes in providing this message board with an update after his passing. I am not familiar with this app, but Robbie gave me a little tutorial. Please forgive any mistakes :) Robbie had initially wanted to pass while conscious, however, he was having increased difficulty breathing Sunday morning. He received last rites from our chaplain and was sedated with midazolam, at his request, at 3:05 pm. He remained asleep and appeared comfortable. Agonal respirations were noted by the nurse at 6:14 pm and suppressed with morphine. The physician called time of death at 6:27 pm, Sunday, November 15, 2020. Robbie's passing was peaceful and without pain. Robbie spoke often of the kind messages he received on this board. I know they brought him comfort. His final posting was incredibly poignant and moved even our most seasoned staff to tears. He was a quiet man. I think his voice was his words. It was honor to attend to him in his passing. I was attracted to hospice because not everybody breaks a bone, not everybody has heart disease, but everybody dies. It is an honor to be with others as the undergo this universal journey, and it was a particular honor to attend to Robbie, who had no family or friends by his side. I am providing some images on imager that Robbie wanted shared with this board, one of him young and healthy, the other a final handwritten note.

They expressed regret at the news of his illness and passing. We are sharing his final posting with them as well. One last thing before I go. First, Robby expressed many concerns about his suboxone. As the opiate epidemic continues to ravage our communities, we see more and more patients entering hospice on suboxone and methadone. I want those of you with opioid maintenance to know that you will never be judged by our staff, and your medications are not a barrier for care. Our organization consults with a pain specialist physician specifically for these cases. We will never let you die in pain. Never! I hope this posting provides some closure for those of you who have been following Robbie's case. These fast cancers are always sad, but Robbie faced his passing with dignity and grace. He was truly a wonderful man, and he lives on in our memories.

{"prompt": "Have you ever felt that the company was the one that failed the interview? I've seen lots of posts here about interviews where the candidate felt that that the interview went badly, they did X or Y wrong, and wanted feedback on how to improve in the future.  How about the opposite? Has anyone had an interview where they felt the employer was the one that completely blew it? If so, why?  I'll start. I am a senior staff scientist at my current employer, and a subject matter expert in a couple of specific areas in my field. A few years ago I got an email from the owner of another local company, who said they saw my resume online and they had an opening they thought would be a great fit, and would I be interested in talking? I visited their website and saw that several of their business areas indeed lined up with my particular skills. I wrote back and said sure, and an interview was set up for a week later. I showed up on time, expecting that I would be meeting with the owner and their chief engineer to discuss their business areas, my background, and the position. Instead, I was met by a middle manager, who took me to a small conference room. We sat down, and he said \"ok, so this is the position\" and described a job where I would sit in a shared space with 6 other people taking data outputted from some simulation and making powerpoint slides. I asked that there might have been some mistake, maybe HR had mixed me up with a junior candidate,  and I said I had been contacted by the owner to discuss a position that was a good fit for my skill set. He said no, and reached into a folder and handed me a copy of my resume. I realized immediately that this was some sort of body shop, they just wanted seats filled to charge contract dollars. I told they guy that I was currently a senior staff scientist, the position was completely inappropriate for someone of my background, and that I didn't appreciate them having deceived me and wasting my time. I got up and walked out. I was there less than five minutes.", "preferred": "Oh yeah. I had one company who (when they saw my resume) got very excited because I have credentials and experience and they responded asking me to interview 30 min after I applied. I'm pretty desirable in this field because most companies have a place for an educated, mid-range staff geotechnical engineer you don't have to train much. The position was for someone a couple steps below me and their posted salary range included my desired number. Note, their posting also noted \"EIT a plus\" which I have.   They almost immediately ask me what salary I want. I quote them 10% more than my current salary (this is the top figure of their salary range!) and suddenly, \"Oh, that's outside of the range we were expecting at this position, we're going to have to talk to management about it.\"  ...I mean... were they expecting to pay me like a technician and get an engineer? Yikes.  Bonus reason they failed the interview- they regularly drop technicians in the winter time and they tell them that the job is year-round. That's not actually uncommon for a set up, but most companies are honest about potential winter layoffs and tell you up front.", "rejected": "Yes absolutely, I have a rule now. If I believe the interview process was not rigorous enough (aka they would hire almost anyone), I walk away. These organizations usually have lots of waste and overhead and I don\u2019t want to work there."}

{"prompt": "Feeling like I am in exile, how did you cope moving to a small city for an academic position? I know this applies to anyone having to move for jobs, but in academia jobs are especially scarce so I wanted to ask here.  I am in my 30s and I am from the largest, most lively city of my country. Very pretty, always something to do. Then I moved to another country for my PhD, lived in the capital for 7 years. Again, very lively, parks, events everywhere.    After searching (and failing) for a permanent job for so long, I finally found one in a smaller city. Its a great job, the university has great reputation in my field, I have decent colleagues. It makes sense to stay here at least a few years and aim for promotion.   But this city is just so plain. I have visited it before with friends but living here alone is a completely different experience. There is nothing historical or beautiful, its just concrete everywhere. When I look at their best restaurants or new cultural events, its just so pathetic.   I know I should be grateful for finding a permanent academic job but I just feel like I am wasting my life here.   Anyone in a similar position? How did you cope?", "preferred": "I never learned how and am currently working on getting out of academia.

The only way to find out which you are is to get out and meet people, build up a friend group, and slowly try to discover what\u2019s in the area. Every place has a least something to recommend it.  But if you\u2019re as unhappy as you\u2019re indicating, it may also be a time to start thinking about your priorities and what you\u2019re really willing to compromise on. Academia demands a lot more sacrifices than most careers, and some people will never flourish within its confines. It took me way too long to realize that I was one of them.", "rejected": "TBH, I haven't really had any problem with it. I grew up in similar communities, so rural small town life suits me well. The only part that's really a drag is that getting to and from the airport is a real time investment.

The best advise is to \"grow where you're planted.\" Start finding activities and building your support community."}
{"prompt": "How would I [34M] know if I felt pain differently to most people? I know how this sounds but please hear me out. I'm wondering how I can find out whether I feel pain properly? The concept that I might not know what pain feels like is freaking me out a little...   My partner of 15 years has always said that I have a high threshold for pain, and on the flip side I've always thought they were super sensitive to rough textures, hot/cold temperatures, et al, that I wouldn't find painful or uncomfortable.  The first time that actually made me think I might not feel pain like other people is every doctor's reactions to my appendicitis symptoms (or lack of) last year.  - Appendicitis, No Pain - TL;DR: I ignored a painless tickle in my tummy for 2 months, and it turns out my appendix had torn. I didn't need any pain meds post-surgery.  Long version - Just over a year ago I went to the GP (Australia) because I had a recurring, funny tightness in my abdomen, and for around two months prior it had felt particularly tight/ticklish or sometimes throbbed whenever I walked for more than 20 mins.  The doc asked me lots of questions, and thought that because I would feel some spaced-out throbbing that it was probably my gallbladder. Doc ended the consult with a physical examination, and after applying pressure to certain areas of my stomach, he suddenly said he would like me to go and get an ultra sound for appendicitis - which I thought was oddly specific, but rolled with it. I didn't have a fever, high blood pressure or any other symptoms.   Becuase I hadn't had breakfast yet, the imaging place was able to see me straight away with the referral from my doc. The radiologist did an examination, and then told me they needed to get a doctor. The doc came in and told me take a CD of the images and go straight to the hospital. They didn't tell me that they thought I had anything serious, so I thought I was just going to the hospital for a more detailed scan or something? It was a nice day, and I had walked 2.5 kms from the GP to the imaging place, and I felt fine so I walked 2 more km to the nearest hospital.  When I arrived at the hospital, things went very quickly - I was told that I would be going in for surgery as soon a room opened up, unless a gun shot victim came in (comically unlikely in Aus), and before long I was wheeled into surgery.  Afterwards, I was told that my appendix had a tear that was plugged with puss. None of the nurses or doctors could believe that I didn't have any pain before the surgery. Follow up consultation with my surgeon after 6 weeks resulted in the same reaction. He told me that he'd seen patients with a similar appendix to me unable to walk due to pain, and said that it was a \"miracle\" (literally his words) the my GP picked up on it.  I was discharged the morning after surgery with prescription pain killers, which seemed extreme as I felt uncomfortable for sure, but not uncomfortable to the point I'd need medication.  All this got my partner thinking about my medical history, and weird things like when I went to the doctor thinking I had a rash, but it turns out I'd been burning myself in showers that were too hot.  When I think of times that I've hurt myself, I would describe the sensations as throbbing, tightness, tingles or a heavy pressure - which people have told me is crazy.  So.... What is pain (??), and would I know if the way my brain interprets pain is off a bit? And if I am a bit different, should I be concerned?", "preferred": "I am like that too. I\u2019ve broke my leg, hopped on the other, had surgery and felt no pain. I like to do my dishes while listening to music, and I\u2019ll finish and sit on the couch and notice my fingers have glued shut covered with dried blood because I\u2019ve cut myself while washing knives and haven\u2019t noticed. I\u2019ve let strep go unnoticed, I\u2019ve let really bad cavities go unnoticed, and when I was little I was constantly covered with injuries I can\u2019t recall.   My surgeon advised me to consult a neurologist, and turned out physiological I am totally fine.   Here\u2019s what he told me. Pain is both a physical reaction and an emotional reaction, and I, and perhaps you as well, have a really low emotional reaction to pain. I do feel pain and know when I\u2019ve hurt myself, but there\u2019s not a strong negative emotion connected to pain. For example, if a doctor gave you a pain stimuli with you eyes covered, you can tell you\u2019ve been hurt and where. Perhaps for someone with high emotional response, they are anxious about the next stimulus, they want the experiment to stop. If you have low emotional response, you are ambivalent to being hurt again, and you forget the painful experiment sooner. You may not be afraid of pain.  You maybe more insensitive to negative stimuli in other aspects of your life. For example, if you have an argument with someone, the other person felt more negative about the exchange than you did. For example, I like to bake, and I regularly forgo the proper protective gear and end up burning my hands and wrists. It\u2019s not I didn\u2019t feel the zing to being burned, I just didn\u2019t care for being burned, at least not enough to put on mittens lol. Again I don\u2019t know if this is your case, but if it were it should fairly obvious in other aspects of your life. People regularly comment on my very even temper, and my seemingly endless patience. The neurologist actually referred me to a psychiatrist, but I haven\u2019t cared enough to visit lol.", "rejected": "There\u2019s something called substance P that goes to the area when you feel pain.. maybe you don\u2019t get a whole lot of that. I\u2019d go see a neurologist for any nerve conductivity issues."}
{"prompt": "The Roman Empire during the Crisis of the 3rd Century experienced 26 claimants to the title of the emperor within a span of 50 years, fragmentation into 3 separate states, and foreign invasions. How would an average citizen living in Rome (or other cities) have experienced this period?", "preferred": "Ok great, something in my wheelhouse. The so-called crisis of the third century has six parts. We need to understand each of them, and relations they have with each other, to understand what was going on and how people would have experienced it. Here are the six parts:  1) A changing climate regime. The Roman Empire had grown up in the midst of the Roman Climate Optimum, a time with excellent climate for the Mediterranean agricultural system (focused on three major crops--wheat, grapes, and olives). This allowed Roman culture to spread--wine was grown in England, something that is extremely difficult and rare, and has only recently been replicated due to our increased temperatures. The climate was also quite stable. As a recently published paper on Hellenistic Egypt has shown, stable climates can be associate with less unrest. This changed in the third century, destabilizing the economic base of the empire.  2) Changing disease regime. The Empire experienced its first massive pandemic in the 160s CE, what is known to historians as the Antonine Plague. It was probably smallpox. Some form of fever, possibly something like Ebola, followed in the 250s. This is known as the Plague of Cyprian after the Christian bishops whose letters provide the best evidence for it. These diseases were new, and devastating. The Roman world knew disease, but its diseases were seasonal and local. None reached pandemic scale.   3) Foreign invasion. A resurgent Sasanian Persian Empire sought revenge for past defeats on Rome. The new dynasty was aggressive and defeated several Roman armies. Newly formed confederations along the Rhine and Danube frontier invaded the Empire from the North, and raided as far as Spain.   4) The need for local autonomy in defense led to political fracturing and splinter empires, like the Gallic Empire and the polity based around Palmyra. Local legions who wanted to serve the emperor and local aristocrats who wanted someone to respect their needs started raising their own emperors. This led to civil war. This was especially bad in the two decades between 250 and 270, which can be seen as the heart of the crisis.   5) Spiritual breakdown followed as the systems that upheld the authority of the emperors collapsed. Who thinks that the emperor is divine when they keep getting killed? Who thinks the gods care when there is no rain and terrible new diseases come. Christianity rises in popularity, but is blamed by many for causing the crisis. In the 250s, the first systematic persecution of Christians begins. This has the paradoxical effect of strengthening Christian communities, which had already begun to gain attention by the charity work they were doing in the cities. The persecutions are just enough of a threat to make christianity stronger but not enough to kill it off.   6) There is a revolution. Rome had for a long time been ruled by an alliance of the Senatorial aristocracy of Italy and the urban elites of the Eastern Mediterranean. This collapses as it turns out that these guys aren't particularly good at what they do. More and more power falls into the hands of the army, and especially the officer core, which is primarily dominated by tough Balkan soldiers. People like Aurelian, Diocletian, Constantine, and a bunch of dudes whose names start with Max- of Cons-. This continues all the way up through Justinian. From Diocletian to Justinian, 82% of the years of the Empire the Emperor was of Balkan stock. They reorganized the state to defend their homelands.   So how does this make people feel? Well, it depends where you are. If you are in a major city you are primarily concerned with barbarian invasion and pandemic disease. We know that in the 270s the first walls go up at Rome in hundreds of years--the so-called Aurelian Wall. We have to remember that at this point Rome has a population of ballpark a million, which is huge. It relies on the Empire to feed it, so any disruption to the systems that brought in the grain from Egypt would have been terrifying, and the arrival of the grain fleet every year was marked by huge celebrations. Much of the importance of the city was changing in this period, however, and fewer and fewer emperors would have spent less and less time there. The centers of action were elsewhere, but if you lived in the city of Rome you would have still thought you lived in the center of the world and the local politics--senators vying for local office, disputed election for the bishop of Rome--would have taken up a lot of your attention. Many times you wouldn't be aware that someone new had been created emperor because by the time they started minting coinage and it got to you they would already have been killed. In general, it would have been bad--but the really bad years were basically 240-270, and that is both long enough for things to get really bad and long enough to get used to it. In cities that weren't Rome, the crisis meant that many cities that were artificial and supported by elites who wanted to play at urbanity for cultural reasons would have disappeared. Walls were built all across the empire, sometimes in great haste and sometimes with great care, but always surrounding small areas of what had once big large cities. The urban fabric shrinks.   If you are in the countryside you might care less about disease (smallpox, e.g., is hard to transmit unless you have crowds) but the climate instability would threaten you, as would the armies (both Roman and 'barbarian' that ravaged the countryside). If you were an elite, you basically worried about getting caught up in power politics and getting killed. Huge numbers of Senatorial families go extinct around this time. If you are a Christian, you worry about martyrdom--but, perhaps, you also seek it. It is a crown to be won, an athletic contest for the ages, you against Satan and the torturers of the Roman state. Basically, it is extremely difficult to generalize, other than to say that it was a period of intense dread. We can see this especially in the ideology of the restored government of the Tetrarchy. Coins bear inscription like \"securitas rei publicae\" (national security). Panegyric speeches talk about how peasants saw soldiers coming and were terrified, but then realized it was the legitimate emperor and ran to greet him, thanking the gods (the speeches I'm thinking of are from the 290s, so traditional Roman gods still play a role).   We can get another sense of how people felt from the letters of Cyprian. Here he is talking about the weather and other things, in a letter from 252 CE:   \u201c Now the world itself speaks and, by the proof of skidding events, testifies to its own decline. In winter, there is not enough rain to nourish the seeds. In summer the warmth that usually roasts the crops is gone. Nor are the springs so joyful in their temperateness, nor the autumns\u2019 trees so fertile in fruit. Fewer casings of marble are ripped from the exhausted, worn-out hills. The mines have already been emptied: they bring forth less and less gold and silver, as the poor veins grow poorer with every passing day. Farmers dwindle and disappear from the fields, sailors from the sea, soldiers from their encampments, innocence from the marketplace, justice from the courtroom, harmony from friendship, skill from industry, discipline from morals... \"...The wars continue unceasingly, our anxiety is doubled by bad harvests and famine; our strength is broken by raging disease, the human race is devastated by the decimation of the plague...\" \" ... And in your contempt and stubbornness, you wonder and complain that the rain falls rarely, that the land is blighted by dust, that the exhausted soil scarcely produces a stringy shoot of wheat, that the driving hail mutilates the vine, that the hurricane uproots the olive tree, that drought stills the source, and a pestilent breeze corrupts the air and a great disease rots away at mankind.\" \"...On all sides they scramble, they steal, they grab: there is no disguise for crime, no hesitation. Each man rushes out to rob, as if it were legal, as if it were obligatory, as if anyone who did not pillage were provoking his own loss and expense.\"  Now of course Cyprian has his biases, but it gives some sense of what it was like.

{"prompt": "CMV: Rather than try to separate athletes by gender, sports and athletic events should have various \u201cclasses\u201d (like weight classes for boxing) and all athletes regardless of gender should compete in their particular class. Gender classification of athletic events is not only pointless, but difficult to enforce. Consider athletes like Caster Semenya who are women but have testosterone levels \u201ctoo high\u201d to compete as a woman in certain athletic events, not to mention the controversy and debate surrounding whether transgender athletes should compete as men or women.  I believe the solution is simple. Rather than attempt to divide sports by gender, sports should be divided into various classes where all people should be able to compete regardless of their gender.  These classes would be analogous to weight classes in boxing. Except instead of weight, one could maybe use height or leg length for something like running. Or perhaps a more athletic-based metric like mile times.  The purpose would be to remove the subjectivity of a person\u2019s sex or gender from the equation and simply focus on different athletes of similar abilities competing for greatness.", "preferred": "This would result in the entire sporting landscape being completely dominated by men, even more-so than it already is.   Women's national soccer teams get beaten easily by 15-year old boys at club level. A WNBA team would get destroyed by the average high school team.   The *only* reason why women get any spotlight in the sporting landscape is because we have women's-only competitions. Not a criticism whatsoever, it's simply a fact that our evolutionary makeup gives men an enormous advantage in the realm of sports.", "rejected": "I think it poses all the same issues.

{"prompt": "Explain like I'm five years old:Is there truly such a thing as a \"fat gene\"? If so, does that mean people can become obese if they eat a normal amount of calories?", "preferred": "The overwhelming majority of obesity is caused by overeating.   The general rule is that if you consume more calories than you burn, your body stores those calories as fat. To loose weight, you need to burn more than you consume.   Human metabolism is largely the same in all people. If you eat 100 calories, and I eat 100 calories, both our bodies will process that food with the same biochemistry. If we both have similar body types and similar life styles, we'll both stay at roughly the same weight. Its true that there is slight variation in metabolism. Metabolisms vary by about 10% between individuals, but this effect is quite small.   That being said, there are genetic factors in obesity, but these are not due to metabolism. We've identified genes which control appetite, and these cause some people to feel more hungry that others, and leads to overeating.", "rejected": "For every general trait like being tall, being strong, or being fat, there is rarely a single gene deciding that, but rather a lot of genes that are influencing that trait, some of them more strongly than others.  Basically every gene that deals with your metabolism will affect, in one way or another, how easily you put on weight.  Some people might have a lot of small genetic factors, others might have a large one.    Also, there is no real \"normal\" amount of calories.  Because every human body is different, every human's metabolic needs are different.  Some people might be the same general size but one of them has a slightly higher metabolism, and that person will gain less weight from the same amount of food."}

{"prompt": "CMV: the body autonomy argument on abortion isn\u2019t the best argument. I am pro-choice, but am choosing to argue the other side because I see an inconsistent reason behind \u201cit\u2019s taking away the right of my own body.\u201d  My argument is that we already DONT have full body autonomy. You can\u2019t just walk outside in a public park naked just because it\u2019s your body. You can\u2019t snort crack in the comfort of your own home just because it\u2019s your body. You legally have to wear a seatbelt even though in an instance of an accident that choice would really only affect you. And I\u2019m sure there are other reasons.  So in the eyes of someone who believes that an abortion is in fact killing a human then it would make sense to believe that you can\u2019t just commit a crime and kill a human just because it\u2019s your body.  I think that argument in itself is just inconsistent with how reality is, and the belief that we have always been able to do whatever we want with our bodies.", "preferred": "Well, except this is not the body autonomy argument at all, so you're battling a strawman. There are two key aspects to the bodily autonomy argument as it pertains to abortion:  (1) The fetus, even if it is a human being, depends on the mother's body until viability (around the 3rd trimester). The fetus should not get to use the mother's body for sustenance without the mother's consent. As stated below, we do not grant any person this right, *even if their situation is our fault*. Parents are not legally coerced to donate organs or blood to their kids, even if its due to a hereditary condition. If I run someone over, I am not legally bound to donate blood to him. If I die, you can't harvest my organs without my explicit consent or that of my next of kin. Why is that, if not because being in charge of my own body is something we hold sacred?   Addendum: I should note that we already follow this logic when it comes to miscarriages. We don't launch a police investigation or charge mothers with criminal neglicence or manslaughter if it turns out something they did induced a miscarriage. I checked: We don't currently charge a mother criminally if, say, it turns out she smoked, drank or did hard drugs during pregnancy. Even though it can kill the child or result in malformations or being born addicted. This is how much we allow mothers because they carry the child in their bodies.   (2) Society doesn't get to force a woman to carry a baby to term. That is effectively hijacking the woman's body against her will, in a situation *where there is no alternative*. Once the pregnancy reaches viability, it is possible for us to extract the fetus and not hijack the woman's body. Hence, that is what we do, and the baby becomes a ward of the state.  So yeah, no, body autonomy is a pretty good argument for abortion being legal. EVEN if you think abortion is immoral, you should recognize the state should not get to force a woman to be pregnant for 6-7 months against her will.", "rejected": "Bodily autonomy stems from the right to privacy, in essence private ownership over one's body. None of this applies to the other scenarios.  >You can\u2019t just walk outside in a public park naked just because it\u2019s your body  Public exposure is not private.  >You can\u2019t snort crack in the comfort of your own home just because it\u2019s your body  Actually, you can. It is illegal to possess crack, but it is legal to be high on crack in the privacy of one's home. Anti-drug laws target the substance itself rather than one's body.  >You legally have to wear a seatbelt even though in an instance of an accident that choice would really only affect you  It would only affect you in a single vehicle accident, but if you have passengers or are in a multi-vehicle accident your body flying out the window absolutely affects other people.  But more to the point, seatbelt laws don't really infringe on one's ownership and decision-making over one's body."}

I was reading Rawls's *A Theory of Justice* and I realized that I was taking almost an hour just to get though something like 10-12 pages (of this kind of text). I had to keep going back and rereading sentences I had already read to understand it, just because of how dense it was. If you were to hand me a novel, like *A Game of Thrones*, I would be flying through the pages.

They've tested dozens and dozens of nuclear bombs throughout the years, and I'm confused why that hasn't messed our world up?", "preferred": "Nuclear weapons are devastating but in the context of the planet earth, they're not really that significant. All the nuclear weapons denotated all at once, won't even shift the planet's orbit or cause the world to break or anything. The earth is far far bigger than human's ability to affect it.   These weapons can destroy lots of human lives and make many areas uninhabitable for a number of years and that could significantly reduce the number of human, animal and plant life on earth. There are theories that it could result in a climate effect called nuclear winter but that is still (thankfully) not put to the test.   Testing, although more common 50-60 years ago, weren't that numerous to pose any danger to the \"world\". Even the largest single detonation probably has an effect of two hundred kilometers in diameter, which is not small but it isn't at all significant compared to the land area of earth (millions of square kilometers). The vast majority of nuclear weapons are tens to hundreds of times less destructive than the largest, the Tsar Bomba. A modest nuclear weapon has a destructive radius of perhaps tens of kilometer which is far smaller than a medium sized city.   That said, there are very few above ground tests in modern times. In fact, there are have been very few in total since the early 1990s.", "rejected": "Initially, they tested them out in the open, and that does indeed create environmental hazards and effects. The sites that were used for testing are still radioactive today, and many people were exposed to harmful radiation downwind of the test sites.   In 1963, the Limited Test Ban Treaty was created to ban nuclear tests aboveground, and allow them only underground. If you test weapons underground, and totally contain the radioactive smoke and debris, then it doesn't contaminate anything other than the hole it is in. That is a much smaller amount of contamination to worry about. The reason for the treaty was that people were getting concerned with how much additional radiation was being added to the air of the world.  Almost all nuclear states since then moved to underground testing. Since the 1990s, nobody except North Korea has tested any nuclear weapons, but even they tested them underground."}

That said, make the batter as directed, including your baking powder/baking soda. You can portion and bake the cake batter directly from the fridge, just try not to agitate or stir it too much while portioning. The leavening starts working initially due to the wetness of the batter and any acidic ingredients to help it along, so you'll end up with flatter, denser cake if you break up the little bubble structure that has been achieved after the rest in the fridge. You may have to add a few more minutes to the baking time to compensate for the cold batter, but it should bake up just fine!", "rejected": "The bakery I work at refrigerates batter all the time, with leavening agents added as normal.

{"prompt": "Why do all of my breads taste \u201cbread-y\u201d and very flat? I\u2019ve been baking a while but more recently have gotten into making things with yeast. I\u2019ve found that a lot of the plainer yeast breads that I\u2019ve made (challah, bagels, rolls, etc) have the same flat kind of taste. I can\u2019t quite explain it but it tastes very bread-y (not like raw flour though), almost a little bitter. I use SAF instant yeast and it\u2019s relatively new so I know it\u2019s not because of bad/old yeast.   I have two theories on what could be causing this but I don\u2019t know enough about making breads to know if either is right. My first thought is maybe I\u2019m not letting it proof long enough for bulk fermentation. Since it\u2019s instant yeast I usually let it go for about an hour and not much longer so maybe it doesn\u2019t have enough time to develop flavor? The second is that since it\u2019s winter where I live and my indoors is usually in the high 60 deg F, I proof it in a turned off oven that starts at about 130F or so. Could the heat be messing up the rise/flavor development?  Initially I thought this taste issue was specific to a challah recipe I used but I recently made bagels and while they had a perfect texture, they had that same exact flat taste as when I made challah and I\u2019ve also noticed this when I made burger buns. Would love any insight, because I feel unmotivated to keep making breads when they all have a weird taste that is not even an expected taste of bread. Thanks!", "preferred": "Of you want more flavour to your bread, 1 make sure you are adding enough salt- use a recipe that tells you how much in grams and expect the amount to be much higher than you think. Apart from the fermented flavour salt is the only thing that flavours all of that flour. 2 proof your bread in the fridge overnight. A slower rise will produce more complex flavours. Also the brand and type of flour you use could play a role but I\u2019d start out with the first two then experiment with fancy flours", "rejected": "What recipe are you using"}
{"prompt": "How horrible is the market for professors I have read that it harder to get tenure than to be an nfl player. I was specifically looking at history, I am a guy who spends way too much time watching youtube on strange historical topics and documentaries.

Data from the American Historical Association and the annual Survey of Earned Doctorates show that the production of new Ph.D.s in History has been about 3x the number of advertised full-time teaching positions in the US (including non-tenure-track jobs) for many years year. COVID made that worse. Combine the massive oversupply with the steep decline in undergraduate history majors-- down 50% at many schools over the last decade --and it's pretty easy to conclude that it's simply no longer a viable career option for anyone but the lucky or the elite.  Case in point: at my modest liberal arts college we've had the pick of the crop in new hires for 20 years at least, always getting 200-300 applicants for TT positions and all of our faculty are from top-ten programs in their fields. Starting salaries are in the low 60K range, which is actually not bad if you look at the AAUP salary data for similar institutions, but it's ridiculous if you compare it to other professionals with similar educational attainment.  With an MA in history you wouldn't even qualify for adjunct work teaching a single course at a time at most schools-- there are big pools of experienced Ph.D.s out there still looking for work.  It's been many years since I've encouraged even our very best undergraduate history majors to pursue a Ph.D. in the field. Unless you're already wealthy and are treating it like a hobby it's almost certainly going to be a costly disappointment. There are other paths to careers in history-- the AHA's career page offers some examples --but if being a history professor is your goal I'd strongly urge you to reconsider given the current market conditions as things are only going to get *worse* going forward as the looming demographic cliff dooms many schools to closure and what market remains will be flooded with formerly-tenured faculty who have lost their jobs and are desperate for work of any kind, any where.  All the while graduate programs will continue pumping out \\~1,000 new History Ph.D.s each year who join the ranks of the underemployed historians from previous cohorts.  When the Chronicle of Higher Ed is running headlines like \"Will Your College Survive the Demographic Cliff?\" and the news is full of stories about school slashing their humanities and fine arts departments I'd suggest there hasn't been a worse time to get a humanities Ph.D. since the mid-1970s...and it's not likely to get better any time soon.", "rejected": "The odds are very very long.

{"prompt": "CMV: Buying a new car is a fundamentally poor financial decision. I've worked in design in the auto industry for almost 10 years and regularly have people asking me all sorts of questions about cars.  The long answer to almost every question is \"it depends on what you want.\"  The only question that I've never heard a good alternate side to is whether or not to buy new or used.  Edmunds says that a car's value drops by 9% when its \"1 minute old\" or in other words, is owned for one minute. http://www.edmunds.com/car-buying/how-fast-does-my-new-car-lose-value-infographic.html  In other words, if you buy a used car that's 0-1 year old, you stand to get almost every feature of a brand new car, sometimes even the new car smell, for 9% less than a car bough new off the lot.  You can even work with a dealership to find exactly what you want (model, year, mileage, features, etc.), have it shipped to the closest dealership, and still save money compared to a new car.  You can even pay the mfg's dealership to do a rundown to see if the car has any issues before you buy it and still play less.  From what I can tell, the only thing you gain by buying a brand new car is knowing that no other person owned it.  For a $30,000 car, you're paying $2,700 to have that feeling.  For the sake of clarity, we're talking about a daily driver that still under warranty.  Not a super car where warranties and values can be much more fickle or where a person can do thousands in damage by bumping a curb.  I think my view is affected by my job.  I see a new model years before it comes out.  I see the 10-20 people who sit in it and drive it short distances.  I see the number of times its touched before it even gets to a dealership where it's regularly touched.  The idea of it being fresh is greatly diminished.  Maybe I've just been conditioned to see cars as the practical and disposable contraptions that they are.  Anyway.  I'll stop there.  I'd love to have my opinion changed.

For some people buying a new car is a reflection of their own lives, i.e. they do it because it makes them *feel* good. That $2700 is exactly that, a premium paid for a feeling. I know you think it doesn't make much sense, but it's the *feeling* of owning something that drives the luxury goods industry too - it's a very common feeling. I believe that a person's financial decisions are based on how they define value in their lives, some people just don't share your view regarding an object's \"value.\""}

Towards the end of the night, they got into a fight, which continued until they got home (they lived together). During this fight a shard of glass or mirror punctured her trachea (still don\u2019t know the truth as to how this happened, but that\u2019s a different story). ___ They had her in the ICU for two days. While in the ER, her lungs stopped working and they put her on a ventilator while in the ICU. Her kidneys started to act up, so they kept her for a full week. I visited her and gave her a care package, we walked around the ward a bit, and she was in pretty good spirits although she got winded easily. Externally, it looked like her injury was healing well. ___  On December 23, she came back to work for a half day. She had subcutaneous emphysema and was retaining water weight for some reason. We took a walk and she got very lightheaded at one point. She was supposed to leave at 2, but she got lightheaded again and said she was going to wait a few minutes before driving, I gave her some water and pretzels. About 10 minutes later, I heard strange gurgling noises coming from her desk (we sat across from each other with a divider in between) so I ran over. She was bent over her desk shaking and barely breathing, her pupils were dilated and she was unresponsive. She also lost bladder control at one point. She fell out of her chair as I was calling 911, and when on the ground she was only breathing 1-2 breaths per minute (agonal breathing?), her face and tongue turned blue and then grey, and she was clenching her jaw. I stayed on the phone with 911 while two of my coworkers started chest compressions. Once the paramedics arrived, they took over, started manually breathing for her, and hooked up an AED (I think), and the first time they stopped CPR she flatlined and wasn\u2019t in a shockable rhythm. It took them forever to find a vein that worked, but they finally got one and gave her epinephrine 3 times that I noticed along with sodium bicarbonate. They also intubated her. I don\u2019t know if this is standard, it seemed strange to me, but they worked on her for over an hour, maybe even an hour and a half - every time they stopped compressions she would flatline, but after the first time her heart was in a shockable rhythm so they shocked her several times. They were unable to resuscitate her, and told us that she died of kidney and respiratory failure. ___ If any additional information is required, I\u2019ll do my best - not sure if I covered everything. I requested a copy of the autopsy report from the county ME but they said the case was referred to a justice of the peace, so I have to contact her directly (and if there\u2019s an active investigation she may not release the report).
