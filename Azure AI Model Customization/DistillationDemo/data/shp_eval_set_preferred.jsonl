{"item": {"input": "How did Hitler become Hitler? I know my question seems very broad or even obvious but what I am trying to figure out is how Hitler convinced a nation that genocide was for the greater good? I know their was fear mixed into it but was there a social stigma already in place that made it possible for Nazi's to follow suit so easily? How does a single man convince a nation that genocide is not a big deal? How did Hitler do it?", "output": "Nazi education is often very lackluster because it focuses too much on Germany itself and too little on the actual mechanics behind Nazi ideology and fascism which can come about in pretty much any shape or form and in any country.  Probably the best description comes from the NSDAP member Carl Schmitt who describes how fascism works.  According to Schmitt, fascism works by creating order through an eternal enemy. So establishing a strong identity by fabricating an ever-present other. The fascist state must be in a constant state of war with the other. This war cannot ever be a metaphorical 'war of minds' or something but a very real, concrete war that speaks to the primitive fears of the people. Creating an atmosphere of constant fear for survival among the people is essential for the fascist state. This fear manifests in hate towards the other and cruelties being inflicted on the other which, in turn, provokes fears and violent reactions by the other which then provokes even more cruel reactions. Therefore a fascist state will always culminate in genocide and war and can never, ever be peaceful. Peace being the one constant normative goal of all political philosophy, fascism fails miserably in this most important aspect. And so it can never work. What the other was for the nazis you already guessed: The Jews. Today's nazis like to create more abstract ideas such as 'deep state' or other conspiracy theories but the mechanics work the same and we can see today that the fear is getting more and more real and guided towards actual people. But not only nazis can be fascist. Something that nobody really seems to understand is that ISIS and other islamic extremist groups are, for all intents and purposes, also fascist. Here the other are the kuffar. They capitalize on fear of the other by comitting atrocities which provokes violent reactions to justify more atrocities.  Additionally, the notion that Hitler was the only man responsible, putting everyone under some kind of diabolical spell is wrong. There were a lot of people who made Hitler what he was."}}

I\u2019m writing this from a place of good faith, so I would hope you respond as such. I\u2019m not religious, but I\u2019m extremely sympathetic to many religious peoples and groups. I think they are a force for good in America, and in many parts of the world.   I have a few points, just a few.  A: Community Organizing and Involvement B: Charity and Donation C: Common Morality   A: This is my biggest point, and it basically boils down to the idea of a central community building or area which can be shared and used for the will of the people. This has numerous benefits to the people, because the face to face human interaction of people who may disagree over politics, law, and the world can help make the situation much more amicable and respectful. People become less separated from each other because there is always a time of the week where you come together, sing songs, talk about life, and unite around something that are all parts of your life. This space can also be used for things unrelated to the church, such as picnics and clubs.  B: Religious organization all across the world, and specifically in America are some of the biggest givers. They donate in large amounts, to lots of different causes and people groups, no matter the time or situation. These donation aren\u2019t always related to faith either, and can range from helping your local homeless shelter to giving aid to Syrian refugees. This has demonstrably helped many people all over the world, and religious organizations are vital to thousands of non profits all across the globe. This isn\u2019t much of a arguable point, since you\u2019d be hard pressed to find someone who hates charity.   C: This is probably the main point you may disagree with, but I think a common sense of moralities is important for a society to function. Obviously they would have to follow the laws, but having act better because of some eternal force combing us all together is , I think, a good thing.   Common arguments against this are absolutely the bad religion has done before and arguable does today.

To me, it's \"normal sweet\", most of the time, but it seems that for most people from the UK or AU (where else?) are disgusted by this level of sweetness. So I am wondering why this is the case. Are desserts in these other countries not normally this sweet?   When I think of dessert, it's something that *should* be very sweet, but also eaten in small amounts, and enjoyed in moderation. Certainly not something you eat every day. So I also wonder if desserts are typically eaten more often in these other countries? Is it an everyday thing? Do you eat larger portions?  I'm really curious to hear from people that have experience with both US-based desserts, and UK-based desserts. I don't know anyone here in the US who has ever reduced sugar in recipes by huge amounts, or complained about something being overly sweet.

The issue is that our diet (not just the US, but the US and Canada certainly are worse than many European countries when it comes to this) has a ton of added sugars, even in foods we wouldn\u2019t consider a dessert. Between that and soft drinks and sweet desserts, you build up a tolerance and it actually takes more sugar to taste equally sweet.   The game changer for me was when I was 13 I was training seriously for a swim competition, and removed all added sugars for about 3 months. I didn\u2019t cut out all carbs, but no dessert,  jams, honey, etc.   I had never realized how sweet berries were - even after about a week and a half, fruit tasted entirely different and like a dessert on its own. It takes surprisingly little time to recalibrate your taste buds, or at least begin to, and while I have not cut out sugar permanently, that was the beginning of understanding why other countries have desserts that are delicious but super subtle compared to the US variations.  As an example, I still love cake but I\u2019ll use a Swiss meringue buttercream with about 70% of the sugar it calls for.

Here's a free copy of the latest book, \"The Book of Broken Promises: $400 Billion Broadband Scandal & Free the Net\", which we put up a few weeks ago because few, if anyone actually bothered to read how the calculations were done. They were based on the telco's annual reports, state filings, etc.-- and the data is based on 20 years of documentation-- Bruce Kushnick http://irregulators.org/bookofbrokenpromises/  I've been tracking the telco deployments of fiber optics since 1991 when they were announced as something called the Information Superhighway. The plan was to have America be the first fiber optic country -- and each phone company went to their state commissions and legislatures and got tax breaks and rate increases to fund these 'utility' network upgrades that were supposed to replace the existing copper wires with fiber optics -- starting in 1992. And it was all a con. As a former senior telecom analyst (and the telcos my clients) i realized that they had submitted fraudulent cost models, and fabricated the deployment plans. The first book, 1998, laid out some of the history \"The Unauthorized Bio\" with foreword by Dr. Bob Metcalfe (co-inventor of Ethernet networking). I then released \"$200 Billion Broadband Scandal\" in 2005, which gave the details as by then more than 1/2 of America should have been completed -- but wasn't. And the mergers to make the companies larger were also supposed to bring broadband-- but didn't. I updated the book in 2015 \"The Book of Broken Promises $400 Billion broadband Scandal and Free the Net\", but realized that there were other scams along side this -- like manipulating the accounting.   We paid about 9 times for upgrades to fiber for home or schools and we got nothing to show for it -- about $4000-7000 per household (though it varies by state and telco). By 2017 it's over 1/2 trillion.   Finally, I note. These are not \"ISPs\"; they are state utility telecommunications companies that were able to take over the other businesses (like ISPs) thanks to the FCC under Mike Powell, now the head of the cable association. They got away with it because they could create a fake history that reporters and politicians kept repeating. No state has ever done a full audit of the monies collected in the name of broadband; no state ever went back and reduced rates or held the companies accountable. And no company ever 'outed' the other companies-- i.e., Verizon NJ never said that AT&T California didn't do the upgrades. --that's because they all did it, more or less. I do note that Verizon at least rolled out some fiber. AT&T pulled a bait and switch and deployed U-Verse over the aging copper wires (with a 'fiber node' within 1/2 mile from the location).   It's time to take them to court. period. We should go after the financial manipulations (cross-subsidies) where instead of doing the upgrades to fiber, they took the money and spent it everywhere else, like buying AOL or Time Warner (or overseas investments), etc. We should hold them accountable before this new FCC erases all of the laws and obligations."}}

People kept telling me that was normal so I pushed through as I am a single working Mom and noticed her behavior was spiraling, more and more aggressive. Yelling, shaking her finger, hitting, pushing...I felt really uneasy but thought I was being paranoid as toddlers can be little buttholes but I decided to buy a recorder and send it to her daycare. I never expected to find anything. The recorder went on all day and within the first three hours there is a recording of the daycare teacher screaming at her to clean up, that she wont eat if she doesn't clean up, you can hear my sweet baby saying \"Okay Mimi!\" (what she called her teacher) so sweetly in the background. Then you hear 5 whacks/hits and my baby starts screaming and what sounds like her jerking my daughter. My daughter starts screaming for me and the teacher says \"Mommy aint coming, she aint coming to get you.\" etc Obviously I cannot SEE the hitting and while it sounded like a harsh \"spanking\" my daughter came home with a swollen eye.   &#x200B;  I haven't listened to more of the recording. I am livid, heartbroken, I feel as though I failed my daughter. I wanted to turn them into CPS, the Police, everywhere but now I am seeing that my initial recording may get me in more trouble than the lady hitting and berating children. Does anybody know the legality of the recording? Is my daughter the one party that is consenting? I am her mother can I consent for her? I did find a case where a mother was charged for something similar but the recorder was located before the child ever took it home, the charges were eventually dropped. I just don't want them to hurt anymore children. Is there anything I can do with this tape or are my hands tied?", "output": "Take pictures of your child's eye and call CPS. Even if the recordings are illegal, having a black/swollen eye is not okay. Also if possible take some sick days while you are finding a new daycare. Don't send her back there please and find a daycare with cameras so if something ever happens to her again they can watch the video and charge/fire the teacher. Paying more for dsycare is worth your baby not having behavior problems from being verbally abused"}}

Our allies abroad may not be aware of this, but Americans surely are: American citizenry exists in Four legally codified castes - felons, immigrants, Territorial Americans and Full Americans.   The only two legal differences between a documented immigrant and a Fully Incorporated American are that 1). If an immigrant commits a felony in America, they can be stripped of their citizenship and deported. 2). Is eligibility to run for the Presidency, which is also not what I'm here to discuss. The first applies to this conversation, the second does not.   Territorial Citizens are fully American citizens on Incorporated soil, but their own communities are not places in which they are fully eligible for federal representation.   The biggest difference in rights however, is between Americans convicted of felonies and Americans who have not been. The definition of a felony is vague in America and many misdemeanors are felonies...based upon the whims of the judge and former records (Jim Crow policies) - but effectively, these crimes, however they are defined in ones state, locality, or federally will leave an American struggling to get a job, unable to vote, often for the rest of their lives, unable to own a firearm (not here to discuss whether our 2nd Amendment Liberties fit in our modern society so would prefer if we kept that discussion to a minimal) and depending on the judge/state, various other requirements, like regular monitoring during \"probation,\" which is effectively a game of catch and release.   My stance is that limiting the rights and opportunities of people with felonies after their sentence (including probation) has been completed is immoral, arguably, tyrannical, and a relic of our enslavement culture, so we should reenfranchise, return gun rights to, and cease deportations of former citizens and limiting jobs available to convicted felons unless credible basis for a persistent threat to our election systems, the safety of others, or other institutions can be established (affiliation with a terrorist or international criminal organization, election meddling, etc...)

If a person preys on the vulnerable, why not limit their interactions with vulnerable people?   If the prison system was genuinely configured to deliver rehabilitation, and prisoners remained confined until they were found to be reformed, I could see an argument for fully restoring their freedoms immediately. But I don't think it can credibly be argued that that is the case. Prisoners are released after serving their sentence. The great majority go on to reoffend, often in exactly the same way."}}

But here goes: My dad is insane and I think me and my family may be in danger and we\u2019re not sure what our options are. So a brief rundown: the past 8 years my dad has had random spikes of psychotic behavior and it\u2019s gotten worse and worse over time. This year, and specifically the past few months, it has gotten worse exponentially. I\u2019m pretty sure he has an extreme case of paranoid schizophrenia and possibly other debilitations. There have been several times that police have come to our house because of calls related to his behavior, but without evidence for an obvious crime, there\u2019s never really been much success there. Especially since he seems to be able to flip off his craziness like a switch when police show up\u2014 then we end up looking like we made the whole thing up.   A little more background, his father fought in Vietnam and had exposure to Agent Orange (suspected, I don\u2019t know the specific details) and ended up becoming very violent and disconnected later in life. My father\u2019s oldest brother has also been diagnosed with schizophrenia and is currently in the state hospital for murdering their mother (my grandmother). My father\u2019s second oldest brother is currently in prison for attempted murder, which he had tried to convince my father to help him with. To put it bluntly: there is a family history of psychopathic tendencies and murder on my dad\u2019s side.  Lately, my father has been getting increasingly crazier. He says he sees spirits jumping in and out of animals and people, he calls it a gift from god. He\u2019s also been watching a lot of murder documentaries and has been making weird comments about murdering people. He told my mother that he needed to kill this guy he suspected of stalking my mother, or \u201cat least cut his legs off\u201d so he can\u2019t stalk her anymore. And then the other day he told my mother that the shows he\u2019s watching are making him want to attempt murder. Specifically, he said he\u2019s been wanting to \u201ctake a hammer and bash someone\u2019s head in\u201d.   At this point, we don\u2019t know what our options are but I fear we\u2019re in a lot of danger.

{"item": {"input": "Why aren't airplanes dimpled like golf balls? Golf balls have dimples to create air pockets, which reduces wind resistance. Wouldn't a dimpled plane be more aerodynamic?", "output": "There are two main components to aerodynamic drag: pressure drag and skin friction. Pressure drag is due to pressure differential between front of an object and its wake region (back of the object). Skin friction is due to drag between object surface and fluid molecules.   Due to shape of a sphere, large portion of golf ball's drag comes from size of the wake, or the pressure differential between front and back side of the ball. Turbulent flow (caused by the added dimples) inherently results in higher skin friction on the ball, but it also reduces the wake size for the ball significantly by delaying flow separation. So in the case of a ball, the reduction in wake more than makes up for the higher skin friction due to the dimple. Another factor often overlooked is spin of the ball. Golf balls (when hit correctly) all have back spin, so the Magnus effect comes into play and creates lift for the ball, allowing it to stay afloat longer. The dimpled surface allows longer flow adhesion over top of the ball compare to smooth ball, so it increases the Magnus effect for larger lift.   In the case of a plane, its shape is already aerodynamic, so the wake size has been minimized from its shape. ~~Creating turbulent flow across~~ Air flow across surface of planes is also mostly turbulent already, so adding dimple to its surface does not significantly reduce wake size. But it does increase skin friction, and result in overall higher drag.  Edited for better accuracy."}}

{"item": {"input": "CMV: Dating and finding a relationship is easier for the average woman compared to the average man Now, this isn't a post to bash women or how dating is easy for women. It's about how when you compare the experience of the average woman compared to the average man, it's easier for the woman to find dates and a relationship.  Let's start with an example from my personal life. Last year some friend of mine broke up. So far the woman has gone on multiple dates with three different dudes one after the other. Essentially when she decides that she doesn't like one guy she just moves on to the next one in less than a week. While my male friend hasn't had a single date so far and that's not due to a lack of trying. Now even though at the end of the day they are both still single, the women at least go on dates which mean she has a higher chance to find someone compared to the man who hasn't been on a single date.  This brings me to my first point. The average woman has a lot more options compared to the average man. I remember reading a survey that said that on average women are asked about 12 times a year compared to asking less than 1 guy out. And when we introduce online dating it gets even worse. On average a woman has a match rate of 30% while a man has 0.013%. This means that statistically, women have a lot more opportunities to meet the one compared to a man. More options are better than fewer options.  My second point comes down to the average dating strategy. The average woman is a lot more passive than a man, in the man is still the one doing the asking out and trying to impress the woman. This means that women have the option to just passively exist and they just pick and choose from their options. In addition to that, they always have the option of becoming proactive and going after the guys they want if they don't like their options. Compared that to the average guy whose only option is to actively go out looking for women and initiating stuff, since if he just stayed and waited for women to approach he will remain single.  And finally, there is the problem that till about the age of 54 there are just more men than women.", "output": "I contribute it to two factors working together; **(1) horniness** & **(2) objectification**. Firstly, let's make it clear that I am not making a claim that men are not more or less horny than women, just horniness in general. Secondly, men do not experience the bullshit that women have to go through due to their gender their whole life. This makes some men trivialize and act without sensitivity, which is *not* attractive.  **Horniness** \\+ **Objectification** = **A bad formula to get a girlfriend.**  **A bad formula to get a girlfriend** = **More men getting denied.**  **More men getting denied** = **More men trying to get with women.**  One could say that \"*women have more choice when it comes to picking men\"* but I'd argue that it isn't an abundance of choice, it's a lack of any good choices."}}

If there\u2019s any difference in the quality, I\u2019d like to know.", "output": "Short answer: yes  Long answer: some jobs don\u2019t need college.  It can help you get a leg up or make connections, but it isn\u2019t needed like most jobs where it is a liability if you don\u2019t have a degree or a certification showing you know the tools and procedures.  You can get a job as an assistant baker and work your way up to being a pastry chef.  It takes longer without college but you can still get there.  Community College is great.  It\u2019s cheap, sometimes free like in your case, and I\u2019ve found that Community Colleges are there to help you rather than there for your money.  I went for my business degree at my local Community College and loved it there; much more than CIA which I went to after for Baking and Pastry.  My Community College had a culinary program and very little baking courses.  I specifically wanted to own my own bakery so I knew I wanted to go and specifically get a baking degree so I\u2019m now $50,000 in debt, BUT own my own successful custom cake business at 24 years old.  My only regret is the debt.  If my Community College had a baking and pastry degree, I would have gone for that.  Going to a bigger, more expensive school gives you a higher chance at getting where you want to be faster, but you have the debt.  It\u2019s something you have to look at what you are willing to give for what you are going to receive.  Going to a Community College is a smart investment because it\u2019s less debt and you are still learning from professionals in your chosen field.  You may get passed up for other candidates when you first graduate, but in this field, experience matters more than degree.  You may get passed up for a pastry job and have to take a job as an assistant baker, but after some time as an assistant, you can reapply as a pastry chef somewhere and they are most likely going to choose you over a recent graduate from a baking and pastry school.  Experience shows you can do the hours, do the work, and want to expand your skillset by upgrading.  Getting a degree means you were in classes and learned how to use different techniques.  They don\u2019t always have the same long hours standing like the actual job.  Some of my classes we sat down for two hours to take notes after 5-6 hours of baking.  That doesn\u2019t happen in the real career.  Plus, colleges have become degree factories.  Not everyone that graduates actually should be in the field which is why they would rather take someone with experience over a degree.  I would recommend you go for the Community College  degree and try to work in a restaurant as either the pastry chef\u2019s assistant or as a prep cook and get cozy with the pastry chefs.  Let it be known you are interested in being a pastry chef in the future and want to learn as much as you can in the industry.  And a tip, when you are learning something from someone as their assistant, if they show you a technique and you\u2019ve seen it done other ways, only comment on it if you like their technique better.  You are there to learn from them and their method is how it goes in the kitchen until you are their equal.  Even when I graduated from CIA, I was a baker\u2019s assistant.  The head baker was self taught and an amazing person and baker.  Her method of piping royal icing was different than how I was taught and how I like to do it.  I did not say anything and wasn\u2019t planning on saying anything until she asked me if I learned another way while making conversation and I told her the truth and it ended up she learned from me.  HOWEVER, I would never correct someone above me without them asking me my opinion.  Sorry for the long comment, I hope this helped at least a little"}}

{"item": {"input": "CMV: The Argument for Student Debt Cancellation is Ridiculous and Flawed I want to make an initial disclaimer that I absolutely agree that college is way too expensive in the US currently and something needs to be done about it, however I feel that proponents of student debt cancellation consistently put forward arguments that are unrealistic, hypocritical, and brazenly self-interested, while masquerading as public interest. I want to discuss a few of them.  &#x200B;  **1.** **It is unfair and predatory to target high school students with these loans when they don't know what they are getting into.**  I somewhat agree, but I also think the simplicity of this argument ignores some realities. The people that sign these student loans are legally adults, and should be held accountable for that. I get that they are facing societal pressures of people telling them to go to college, but as legal adults it is their responsibility to know what they are getting into. I would support increased education for high school students about loans and debt, but absolving an entire demographic segment from responsibility for their debt on the basis that \"they couldn't have known\" is frankly ridiculous and feels like a cop-out.; 18 year olds are legally able to join the military or buy a home. If we want to absolve 18 year olds of their student loan debt, we would need to have a much bigger conversation about whether 18 year olds can legally be considered adults at all.  &#x200B;  **2. Student loans should be dischargeable through bankruptcy**  Sounds good in theory, but this ignores a fundamental principle of how bankruptcy works. If a business declares bankruptcy or if you can't make payments on your house or car, the bank can seize the business's assets or your house or the car. But if you can't make student loan payments, the bank can't exactly seize your degree or education.  &#x200B;  **3. We should cancel student debt because it would spur economic activity**  I'm not sure whether more consumer spending is even what we need right now in the high-inflationary economic environment in the US, but in any case, the argument has been present in so many political debates in recent political history, where one side asks to be given more money/spending power with the assurance that this economic activity will translate to the rest of the population in some way (Trickle Down Economics anyone?). It has always sounded to me like pro-cancellation arguers are just asking to be given more spending power, while hiding behind an argument that it's actually for the public good. Furthermore, I feel that undermining the principle of how debt works in our society by outright cancelling such a large amount of it would have enormous economic consequences and this would would outweigh any potential economic benefit (i.e. the debt can only be cancelled if the US government agrees to assume all of it, which would be incredibly expensive, or if they just order it to be written off, in which case no lender would ever have faith in the future that they can lend money and be assured of getting it back; at the end of the day, someone has to pay). If the Fed or the government really wants to spur economic activity, they can do so through targeted economic policy like stimulus packages or interest rates that wouldn't be nearly as haphazard or dangerous.   &#x200B;  **4. People who have paid off their student loans that are critical of student debt cancellation for others are wrong**  I have seen this one a lot. People who have paid off their own loans are critical of student debt cancellation (IMO justifiably so),because they feel that they worked hard and sacrificed to pay off their loans and are now being penalized by missing out on a hypothetical debt cancellation bonus. The counter-argument often offered is that these people are being selfish and that this is the price of progress, and we can't just not take progressive action simply because some people may miss out. An example that I have actually seen put forward on Reddit is that: if we hypothetically invent a cure for cancer, we can't just not use the treatment on current cancer patients, even if people who have already died of cancer may have missed out on this new treatment; we have to strive to progress as a society and cannot cater to the \"bag-holders\" who may have missed the wagon. This doesn't make sense to me, and again seems incredibly self-interested. A more applicable analogy to the cancer example would be if tomorrow we cap annual tuition for college at $5k for all future generations and leave all current student debt holders as the proverbial bag-holders; doing this would immeasurably benefit future generations in a sustainable fashion and allow equitable access to education, but current student debt holders would be the ones stuck paying the \"price of progress\".   &#x200B;  My personal stance on this issue has always been that we should lower interest rates so that people can actually pay off the debt, and focus our valuable political capital on policy action that tries to regulate or lower college tuition costs and expand access to college through these lowered costs, rather than cancelling student debt, which to me feels like a Band-Aid post-factum solution that doesn't address the root cause. I would love to hear what everyone else thinks!", "output": "In your first point, the argument says \"X is *unfair*\", and your entire counterargument is \"But X is *legal\".*  This is entirely missing the point of the argument. Yes, everybody knows the entire process of getting people to sign up to student loans was legal. The point is not that it was illegal, but that it was unfair.   Saying something should not be changed *because it is legal* is, in large part, absurd. The entire question of \"should this law be changed\" is the question of whether we should change the legality of something. Countering any such question by saying \"but it is legal\" is an empty argument."}}

Looking forward to your questions, ask us anything!", "output": "I always hear how only 5% of the total energy in the universe is in ordinary baryonic matter, 25% is dark matter, 70% dark matter (or thereabouts)  What of light? Does it not contribute to the total budget, and does it not exert a gravitational force along with the ordinary and dark matter, can enough of it all together not create blackhole? What then is light's contribution? Or does it not have a gravitational effect unless all together like a kugelblitz blackhole and so each star is gradually lowering the amount of gravitational force of its galaxy and in the universe as a whole with each photon it produces?  Which then brings me to the next part of the question. Does the expansion of the universe, as it stretches out those photons and gravitational waves, does it actually mean they have less energy? Or is it the same amount of energy just stretched out over a longer wavelength? And if so, is light's contribution to the 'energy budget' of the universe (and it's gravity) being continually weakened as the universe underwent inflation and expansion.  Anotherthing I've wondered, about the CMB. Given how its light has had to pass through 13B years worth of vast clusters, filaments and voids, getting stretched and distorted and lensed before reaching us, how is it worked out that the CMB has true 'hot' and cold spots, and not just distortions given the intervening matter (or lackthereof) which isn't yet fully mapped?

Those timelines are incredibly divergent in many crucial ways, not just aesthetically. People being alive or dead, marrying others or not, destroying cities or not, killing villains or not, etc.  Either way though, the meta answer is that there's no consistency between these stories, and different writers have different levels of familiarity with each other's work. Different writers also care less.   However, the *in-universe* answer is that time is convoluted, and there is more than one Terry McGinnis and his neo-dystopian Justice League Beyond. There is more than one Batman Beyond, more than one possible Prime Earth future, and even more than one Beyond continuity that we've seen -- Future's End was all about *a* Batman Beyond coming to the present, even if at the time it was... you know, *the* Batman Beyond.  It's weird and vague, but just imagine that Terry is an archetype of a future that might come to be. Most Terries are going through slightly different versions of adventures, and most are known to share experiences because that's just how that reality works. You can kind of assume every Superman has gone through an X number of events until a certain branching point.   For instance, there was a Batman Beyond that had a Robin. There was another that didn't. There was one that died, there was another that didn't. These are real comics and episodes you can look into.

Recently, I stumbled across the opposite scenario. I found a population of the most active supermassive black holes out there. These black holes are so active that we normally would not expect their host galaxies to be intact and forming lots of stars... and yet, they are!

{"item": {"input": "How to help a friend struggling to swim in the deep end of academia? Buckle up, this requires a lot of background. My friend Hanna is in her mid-thirties. We met in graduate engineering school, were TAs for the same class and became close friends over time. I am not and have never really been in academia - got my MS and peaced out to industry. I'm struggling to understand how to help her because of my lack of knowledge.  She seems to become unhappier the more she sticks around academia, but is determined to stay in academia. Her dad was a professor and she loves teaching - whenever she used to come back from office hours, her eyes would just light up with joy. She'd always get the best, most ridiculous ratings on our TA reviews by the students.  She took about 6 years to finish her engineering PhD at a top university. Her advisor seemed a bit strange (rambled a lot, was disorganized, took three years to even read her second paper). If that person was my boss, I would have moved jobs because it seemed stressful and there was a lot of agonizing over things maybe not in her control? She had a fair number of papers when she graduated (3 with 1 more in process). She never seemed super happy writing papers and did not bug her professor as much as I would have for not reading her 1 paper.  She got a post-doc at another very good university. 6 months in and she was unhappy again. Similar to her first professor, this advisor seemed to ramble a lot, work odd hours. At least she got another paper published? But she would call being very stressed or unhappy about how things were running so I suggested maybe this post-doc wasn't the right fit. There was no teaching associated with this role.  She got another post-doc, this time at a top university. She gave the other professor 5 months notice that she was leaving. She was promised the ability to work on the research she wanted to work on. The new professor seemed very nice and from what she described, seemed to have more structure than the last two.   Well, it's been almost a year, and she is still very unhappy. I visited recently - and it just happened that her lab was going out to lunch so I joined - and the professor (her advisor) seems more chill (but still very rambly) but very oddly unprofessional? The professor spent most of lunch talking more than everyone else, and complaining to the lab manager about a small part of his job.  Hanna did not get what she promised from her advisor - she has not gotten to work on any of the projects she wanted to. That said, I know Hanna. She dislikes writing grants and I think might let opportunities like that slide by (or she certainly doesn't search them out). I also know that she's not super forceful in trying to communicate what she wants to work on, and she hasn't made specific plans to get there. I wish I could she say she was happy going with the flow - but she is specifically unhappy jumping on every odd task the advisor asks her to do. And there's no teaching.  And she will not quit. She's told me she's not sleeping well, and while she sat at her at-home desk when I visited for 8 hours, at least 2.5 of those hours were spent surfing the web or looking at youtube. She has mentioned being depressed (we don't really talk about specifics) but I know she's in therapy once a week.  She took one of these figure-out-what-you-want career paths with my and other friends' encouragement, and I desperately hoped this was it, she'd figure out that academia is making her unhappy and decide to do something else (probably teach?). Instead, she decided working at a smaller university with less research and more teaching is what she wanted to do.  I really want to support her. I've put together lists of universities she can look at, have offered to help review her research and teaching statements, and have tried nudging her to come up with a timeline for completing materials. She hasn't done the timeline thing. She never does. She has done some informational interviews, which I think is good. I've tried to encourage her to do some of these outside of academia - she's done a few, but frustratingly just with previous lab mates.  She also doesn't network. In my industry, that's just about the most important thing you can do. She is very introverted, and covid definitely hasn't helped get her going to events and just meeting other people in academia. I've tried to push her to do this, but she doesn't budge.  I've been very critical of Hanna here, but she is brilliant (like was valedictorian of undergrad and got almost perfect 4.0 in grad school), very caring and thoughtful, and I think is an amazing teacher. She is not the most organized and for some reason will not put things on a calendar to go do. She does not like writing grants, is on the fence about papers, and enjoys talking to the people she is close to and that's about it. Judging from all of her advisors who I could not stomach working for, I don't think she's great at judging character.  She seems more unhappy now than she has in a while (probably about as unhappy as she was when she changed post-docs). She thinks she needs to stay in her current post-doc another year while she applies to positions at small universities. I'm really worried about her - I know a job you despise can make your life miserable and lead to depression. She may already be there. I want to help her.  -Should I push her to leave academia? -Should I continue to push her to get on top of the small university applications? -Does she really need to stay at this post-doc another year if she wants to pursue an faculty position? -Would it really be the end of her academic career if she took an industry job for the next year? -What should I be doing to support her? -What advice do you have for her that I should pass along?", "output": "I think your friend tells you this stuff because she wants to vent, not because she wants you to solve her problems.

My grandparents agreed to having her move in with us. Recently they started to worry more and more about furniture being destroyed. They just told me that the only way to keep her with me is to declaw her front two paws. I am in shambles. I have always been against declawing.. do any you guys have declawed cats? Do they change afterwards? I just really need some guidance. When they told me I had to do this I immediately went to the bathroom and bawled my eyes out. Lala is my bestfriend and I don\u2019t want her to be in pain.", "output": "Declawing is not the answer. It\u2019s entirely possible that, like many people, your grandparents don\u2019t understand the severity of the procedure or the common repercussions. MANY people mistakenly think that declawing is just removing or cutting off the nails, and that a cat will be good as new. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s an AMPUTATION of the last bone in each toe. Feel your fingers - it would be like amputating the last bone that you feel that starts right above your fingernail. It\u2019s barbaric, it\u2019s outdated, and many cats suffer life long issues because of it. Many people who have declawed cats will say that their cats were not negatively affected by it, but they just don\u2019t notice the subtle signs.   Declawed cats are more likely to BITE (and a cat bite is almost always worse that a scratch)  They are prone to early onset arthritis, because being digitigrade animas (animals who walk on their toes), amputating that last joint shifts their weight back onto their big paw pad, which changes their stance, which leads to chronic back and joint pain.  Declawed cats often suffer litter box aversion. How will your grandparents like it when the cat starts peeing or pooping on the rug?  Declawing isn\u2019t always straightforward, and complications can arise with the healing process, or even years down the road. I\u2019ve seen cases where the process was done incompletely, and a nail began to grow again, under the skin until it eventually pierced the skin.  Because declawing is NOT the answer to stopping or preventing a cat from scratching, and it is cruel and barbaric, many veterinarians no longer perform this service (in my 10+ years as a veterinary nurse, the only doctors I\u2019ve known who would do it were in their 60s/70s and ready to retire. NONE of the young vets would do it). And, in many countries it\u2019s illegal, and in parts of the US as well.   For people who argue that declawing keeps a cat from being surrendered to a shelter, I implore you to work a few months in a shelter and keep a tally on how many declawed cats are surrendered due to house soiling, biting, early arthritis, or other behavioral complications.   Please find some literature and share it with your grandparents. The Paw Project has a lot of resources. Also, you can cover furniture with blankets (that\u2019s what I do). They also make adhesive that doesn\u2019t hurt fabric that you can put on the corners of furniture that prevents a cat from causing damage (it\u2019s called Sticky Paws). You can also provide appropriate areas for the cat to scratch, like various scratchers, and reward her for using them. You can also apply nail caps. Less ideal, but you can confine the cat to certain areas of the house."}}

Also vaguely relevant is this fascinating blog post which mentions a gay conservative christian who simply *didn't realise straight people exist* - they saw gay people as weak willed pleasure seekers who had given into temptation, because to them homosexuality seemed very appealing and tempting, and they assumed that everyone else felt the same way. As such, they did think homosexuality was a choice - a choice in the same category as adultery or drug abuse, where you do something you know is sinful becsuse it feels good."}}
{"item": {"input": "Possibly overdosed on a MAOI. Having amphetamine-like effects 24/7 now + severe tachycardia&hypertension when eating chocolate - what should I do? **TL;DR:** A study said ethanolic Garlic Extract is a MAOI, I started eating 6-7 cloves of garlic daily for this effect (today is day 8). On days 3 and 5 I ate chocolate, and both times my heart rate shot up to ~130 BPM and blood pressure to ~150/85. Past few days, I've been feeling a 24/7 amphetamine-like drug high - focus, irritability, heart palpitations, high resting heart rate (85-90 BPM). Last time I ate Garlic was 24 hours ago, yet I still experience these symptoms. I fear that the MAOIs in garlic are irreversible - if so, could it possibly take 2-3 weeks for my symptoms to resolve (until new MAO enzymes are made)? What is the appropriate treatment until symptoms resolve? (Been taking Oxazepam after the chocolate-tachycardia, but can't take it daily because of withdrawal concerns).  ****  Age: 24  Sex: Male  I have been reading a study saying garlic has antidepressant effects in rats, and that it works by MAO inhibition, with comparable potency to the clinical MAOI Imipramine. Because of this, I proceeded to eat 6-7 cloves of raw garlic daily for 1 week, for the antidepressant effects.  I did feel stimulant-like, mild-antidepressant effects already on the first day, so I kept eating such amounts of garlic for a week. However, on Day 3, I had an incident where I ate chocolate, and got a mild version of \"hypertensive crisis\" - my heart rate shot up to 134 BPM, my blood pressure to 148/86 (my usual: 100/60). I immediately took 20mg oral Oxazepam and my vitals normalized. I didn't link it to the garlic, and so on Day 5, I ate chocolate and the same thing happened again, and Oxazepam helped me again.   Today I finally made the connection. The last time I ate garlic was 24 hours ago. Looking back, I realize that in the past few days, I've had pronounced amphetamine-like effects that lasted the entire day, every day, for at least 3-4 days. Focus, irritability, heart palpitations/\"flutters\", high resting heart rate - most of the effects. I took Adderall in the past, and I currently feel very similar to how the Adderall made me feel.  This makes me very concerned. My high resting heart rate (85-90 BPM) gives me a lot of discomfort, and the palpitations are worrying. Since I know many MAOIs can be irreversible, my biggest fear is that the MAOIs in garlic are also irreversible. In this case, does it mean it will take a few weeks for my symptoms to resolve?

{"item": {"input": "First Year PhD Student Increasingly Disillusioned This is a throwaway account and I will try to skirt around any information that would identify me. I am in the US. I apologize for the length of this post but I am at my wits' end.  ___  I went to a very prestigious high school and, due to financial reasons, had to lower my gaze from the elite universities that most of my classmates ended up attending. I went to a pretty good public university on a full scholarship and did my best to never look back. I started as a CS major due to interest in high school. I got a research position in my second year (which I held for the rest of my undergraduate career), but found myself increasingly pulled towards mathematics and theoretical CS over the more application-oriented curriculum.   After some deliberation, I moved over to majoring in physics. (Actually, I felt I was so deep into the CS major that I might as well finish the degree, so I double majored.) For many reasons, I enjoyed the subject much more, but I was behind my classmates and my grades ended up \"suffering\" (A-s and some B+s, low in my eyes) for it. I caught up fast enough to have a good GPA in upper-level courses, but I did not have any room to explore graduate courses or electives due to my double major. I ended up finishing in ten semesters, which required taking multiple summer courses and a few semesters with course loads that made my advisors sigh. I had room for exactly only one elective (analysis) and one graduate physics course (QM).   I very often felt insecure about my non-extraordinary setting. I really want to say that the school doesn't matter, and that a committed student can be great anywhere, but the world has seemed to disagree with me on every single occasion. To try to keep a level ground, I periodically messaged friends studying physics at Ivies so that I could self-study material at a more sophisticated level. I have also worked through a general undergraduate math curriculum as I lean heavily towards mathematical physics. As of now I am still self-studying math, currently algebraic topology (Hatcher), next functional analysis (Conway).   My Physics GRE was something like 75%th percentile, which disappointed me greatly. I kept my head up and did not hold myself back when applying for PhDs. I did extensive research and applied only to schools I felt strongly towards, one of which was my undergraduate university. One of my advisors mentioned a very competitive scholarship for a full-ride to a English university, so I also applied for the Master's-equivalent there. That was my giant reach, and I was optimistic that my hard work would translate better through my essays than through my grades and raw data.   I was eating lunch with my friend when I saw the email that I wasn't chosen for the scholarship (after getting to the final round). I made a stupid excuse to him and went to the lab room where I put my head down and cried until I fell asleep. The truly awful part was a line in the email saying (paraphrased) \"Everyone who got to this stage is such a good candidate, this is probably the first time you've been turned down from something like this,\" after spending five years battling uphill so hard.   In the end my choice was between a PhD at my undergraduate institution, and admission the English school with no financial assistance. Because of COVID (and money, like always), I went with the PhD. I am in my first semester and the feelings of inadequacy get worse every week. I am still trying as hard as I can, but I feel like I am at an insurmountable disadvantage in my position and that a career in academia is completely doomed. Conversations like this recent one in r/math (which I frequent) constantly reinforce the idea that I am on a sinking ship.

However, the ratio of applicants to job openings is not in my favor, and I am nowhere near the top of the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 pile.

Saying platitudes like do not give up and continue the fight is futile: it is your decision and only you could know what's best for you. But I honestly believe that it is possible to get a job of your (I stress current) dream even after graduating from a public university.  Getting a position in academia, especially in what seems to interest you the most (theory), is hard and I do not think there are any prospects of becoming easier. Definitely getting a degree from one of the first tier universities helps a lot, but it should be taken with a grain of salt. Just a degree from say Princeton or Harvard does not guarantee a professorship. I personally know several people who didn't get a position (for several different reasons) after a PhD at an ivy league university.   One of the biggest advantages of the best schools -- apart from being surrounded by (on average) the best people, not only professors but more importantly other students -- is having access to the network of people, and it is not in a bad and corrupt sense. On average a professor in Harvard has more friends (or just colleagues with whom they are on good terms) than say a professor from a third tier university. It is not to say that there are no good public universities at the same time. I do not know what your university rank is but from what you told it seems that your professor is not isolated from the world.  The danger of staying at one and the same place is that the longer you stay there the more it is considered to be against you, unless this is Harvard or akin to that. It would mostly be viewed that you stayed there for the lack of options and not because this was the best place for you.   In order to have better chances of getting a professorship one must stand out from the crowd (of equally or even more competent people) in some important aspects. Doing research which does not attract interest from the community (which is mostly the case for average universities) will not help, visibility could be crucial.   So choose a topic of your research accordingly, look at what interests not only you but what also is of interest to other people. If you cannot get a support for working on the subject at your place try contacting professors from other universities. It is not guaranteed that every single one of them would be happy to start immediately working with you, but you'll never know without trying.  Lastly, maybe try opening up your mind. I do not mean it in an offensive way, but focusing only on physics (theory) may not be the best strategy."}}

Often times I here people say they hate cats but I've never heard really any good reason to hate cats. The only one I can really understand is that they're allergic. But other than that, cats are pretty easy to maintain and take care of especially compared to dogs. Whenever someone says they hate cats they always use vague terms like, \"cats are evil\", or \"cats are just mean\". I think what people don't understand is that cats don't love unconditionally like dogs do. From my experience if you treat a cat with love and take care of it as you should cats can be the most love able creatures on the planet. With dogs however, you could literally be abusive to a dog as long as you feed it it'll still obey your command.  That's why I think majority of people say they hate cats. Because cats aren't going to blindly follow all your commands like a dog would so therefore they aren't as programmable as dogs if that makes sense. Each cat has its own unique personality and what it likes.  Cats also don't attack people like dogs do cats for the most part just mind their own business and don't require much attention. Cats are much more hygienic than dogs, cats don't bark all the time and disturb people, cats overall don't really bother anyone.

Moreover, if you do it anonymously, then it will really seem like it was an aggrieved party, and might cause some blowback from the professor onto the student.

Are these students getting preferential treatment in their classes? Are you being threatened for knowing? Or are you just wanting to call out a bad actor?

The reason why conservatives hate cancel culture isnt because they necessarily disagree with whom is being canceled( i thought pepe was a goner years ago) but because only select individuals decide who is allowed to stay and who is allowed to go. lets take Future for example, one of the most popular rappers alive right now and certainly of 2015-2019.  one of his most popular songs is called \"mask off\" the lyrics in the chorus are \"Percocet, Molly Percocet\".   my problem with cancel culture is if we agree that Pepe is contributing to rape culture surely future is contributing to the opioid epidemic no? but the gatekeepers do not ever hold rappers  to the same degree that they do this cartoon skunk and if you ever try to bring it up they dismiss you.

It's a company moving along with the times and recognizing that certain things are just not acceptable any more.   Like you're literally comparing an animated skunk made for kids cartoons to a mumble rapper that raps about decidedly adult topics.   One is a cartoon that doesn't exist, the other is an actual person. Hell, we have whole ass abusers and rapists out here making music not being 'cancelled' in any meaningful way. How long did it take for people to actually acknowledge that R. Kelly was a disgusting man? And people still listen to his music and attribute him as one of the best R&B singers/songwriters. Michael Jackson has been accused of allegedly touching children and Thriller still hits the top streaming charts every year.   If cancel culture was real, then PewDiePie wouldn't be one of the top YouTube channels. Jeffree Starr would be out of business. The Kardashians would be bankrupt. The Paul Brothers would be irrelevant. Donald Trump wouldn't have Almost become president again.

The Second Sex, in particular, has suffered from bad translations!  I've done some searching, and I can't seem to locate a version in the original French online (and I don't have a physical copy handy).  But my guess is that this sentence suffers from some of the translation defects mentioned in that link - an excessive effort to reproduce the sentence structure and rhythm of the original French, without capturing the meaning of the original.  The good news is that this overly-faithful translation provides a fair number of clues what the original French might be.

And \"themselves\", most likely a translation of \"elles-m\u00eames\", supports this, which I try to lock in by adding the word \"complicit\".  Finally, the English clumsily implies that women are in bed while showing support for  \" the public worship of virtue\" - so I moved \"public\".  I was half tempted to replace \"\\[the\\] bed\" with the more explicit \"intercourse\", to step back a bit from the French tendency towards metaphor and guard against Anglophone literalism (\"what's mysterious about the bed?\") but decided against it.   &#x200B;  I don't see in this excerpt any indication of the idea that \"women are inferiors who tempt men to sin\" - just that women are even more eager than men to deny in public the existence of private sexuality."}}

{"item": {"input": "Is ABET Accreditation Important? Hi, I'm a high school senior in Turkey and I am trying to decide which university I should prefer after my university exam. The highest-ranked university in the exam is Ko\u00e7 University. However, its engineering programs are not accredited by ABET. The programs are accredited by another organization named MUDEK and the organization is a part of the Washington Accord. It says on the internet that if a member of the Washington Accord accredits a program, it is counted as accredited by ABET.   Is ABET accreditation important after graduating? Would the mentioned situation create a problem, or did you experience something like this?", "output": "Hi there! I am currently going through the process of getting my license without an ABET degree. I have a CEAB degree (Canada). CEAB degrees are on the Washington accord as well and because Canada is the neighbor, many states directly say they accept CEAB.  To become an engineer in the USA, you need to go through NCEES. You will need to take the FE exam in your 4th year of engineering (so you have the fundamentals down) or right after graduation. Most likely to take the FE you will need to get your education verified which costs $350 USD for NCEES to do, but once they do it, you never have to do it again and you'll never have to provide transcripts again because its on NCEES. You do the education verification once you graduate and have your transcripts and proof of degree so you can send those in. You will also need course catalogs (the things that say the details of every course) for each year of study and the courses you took, so its best to save those from your schools website each year because finding archives of the course catalogs afterwards is painful (at least it was for me). Once you have your education verified, you take the FE and then the PE. Now here's the fun bit, every state has a different procedure for the process of becoming an engineer. Some states require you have your education verified by NCEES if its not an ABET degree, other states will accept ABET and CEAB, and some even say that if its on the Washington accord your good, but, and I just found this out, if you are in a state that accepts a not education verified degree and you move to another state that requires it, you'll have to do the process, so you might as well just do the process anyways if you don't know where you'll end up or if you ever think you'll move states. While my current state doesn't need my education to be verified, I am doing it anyways so that if I ever move, which I can see occurring in my lifetime, I will not have to go through the process of getting everything with my transcripts etc sorted out as honestly its a huge hassle. Another thing with the PE and different states is the whole procedure going from graduate to \"EIT\" (Engineer in Training) to licensed engineer. Some states require that you pass the FE and submit an application to be called an EIT after passing the exam and then require you to get 4 years work experience before you are allowed to take the PE exam which is basically the FE exam but slightly harder - it contains pretty much  everything you learn in undergrad with math and conceptual questions, but, funniest part ever, no ethics subject on the PE (this to me is the most important trait in an engineer and they could care less it seems). Other states don't have the EIT registration part but have a 4 year experience requirement before you take the PE exam and some states just have \"decoupled\" it entirely and you can take the FE and PE whenever. To get the license and stamp, however, you have to have 4 year of experience no matter what state your in. Hopefully that makes sense.   &#x200B;  I highly recommend if you plan after your degree is completed that you move to a US state that has a decoupled system. Take the FE and PE as soon as you possibly can while you still have the information fresh in your mind because after 4 years, it gets really rusty and these tests are basically just math tests that you have to pass, they don't really care about how good of an engineer you are. While it sucks that when you \"finish\" you aren't done with school yet, its way easier to just focus on two tests than 6 at a time (I had 6 courses each semester at my school and it was hard, but I worked hard and graduated at the top of my class!). and its way better to not have to relearn everything 4 years later.   &#x200B;  Check out this link to get an idea of what states accept what in regards to education:  https://www.sru.edu/documents/academics/online-learning/Engineer%20Licensing%20Requirements%20by%20State.pdf  Here is the NCEES page you'll need to eventually make an account on.

Spend time on this website as its your guide to success in the USA engineering world.  https://ncees.org/   If you have more questions, feel free to contact me. I know this is a wall of text, but I hope to inform others how it works when coming from abroad. I tried to learn all of this when I was still in university, but no one really could tell me all the information I needed to know. Even now while actually going through the process of figuring it out, I still get conflicting information from my state and NCEES and others, but hopefully me above experience helps you and many others that stumble across this post."}}

Why do Academic philosophers seem to operate in hermetic communities and discuss topics with little or not application to practical life? Why aren't they making an impact?", "output": "I think this implied idea that Socrates is radically unhermetic is on quite shaky ground.  You can find lots of different estimates for the population of Ancient Athens, so I\u2019ve picked a reasonable hovering number at about 120,000 people, within an Ancient Greek population of less than 10 million, spread out over an enormous area (far larger than Modern Greece) covering various city states and islands with highly variable relationships with each other, and different political structures. So that\u2019s roughly the population of modern London covering huge chunks of the Mediterranean coast and Black Sea, and in so doing therefore much of the world as then known to the Greeks prior to Alexander\u2019s conquest. So that\u2019s Athens itself with a population about half of the Borough of Lambeth (big up) within an Ancient Greece the populational size of a London spread across the aforementioned Mediterranean coastline and Balkan Peninsula, accounting for a significant chunk of the then known world.  Socrates was only one of a number of people satirised by Aristophanes, who associated him with philosophers *generally* (including the Sophists to whom we now consider him opposed), and in so doing thought of him as a ridiculous character with nothing to say worth listening to. He was of the wealthy citizenry, never knew slavery (slaves making up as much as half or more of the population), and was able to pursue the leisurely pursuits of what we would now call the urban upper middle classes, such as philosophy, without financial impingement. So he was a wealthy citizen in a small borough of London, hanging out with the other wealthy citizens, some chunk of whom never so much as bothered to work out what he thought in the first place before ridiculing him, who was eventually put on trial and executed during a time of significant political disquiet because he was perceived as offending the sensibilities of important people in the borough.  This isn\u2019t a final answer to your question, and covering Socrates\u2019s posthumous influence just isn\u2019t within my power right now, but it should shake up any perception you may have of his being a sort of beacon light that shone through all of Athens and therefore the world in his own lifetime. He\u2019s not even, I dunno, Lenin. See his interaction with a slave in *Meno* (a fictional dialogue, sure, but a representation of him as a character by Plato): he calls the slave boy over to demonstrate that an untaught slave has knowledge of mathematics, he doesn\u2019t immediately start preaching the radical reformation of the social world to the masses."}}
{"item": {"input": "CMV: Ceaselessly Hate-Sharing the Posts of Our Political Enemies Does More Harm Than Good I'm from the US and personally lean pretty far to the left, so my Reddit feed includes several left-leaning subs, and some days it feels as though my feed is dominated by reposts of tweets from Ben Shapiro, Matt Walsh, Stephen Crowder, Charlie Kirk, Marjorie Taylor-Greene, Lauren Boebert, etc. I like to laugh and gape at the dumb things they say as much as anyone, but at a certain point it feels like the sheer amount of signal boosting we do of extremist and troll voices does more hard than good.  First, I want to acknowledge the one positive that occurs to me (there maybe be others) -   1) **It gives us a window into the opposition's thinking.** However stupid these beliefs may seem to me, they're held by millions. And while some of these people are just troolish pundits - Crowder, Kirk, Walsh, etc - others are actual members of the US's national governing body. So however much I might cringe at what they're saying, it might also be important for me to hear it so I know what I'm up against.  But I personally just feel that the downsides are stronger -   1) **It feeds the troll.** These people go out of their way to post the most incendiary possible version of their beliefs specifically to garner attention, both good and bad. They want to rile up their base, but also to rile us up. All press is good press if you're a scumbag, and they seem to take pleasure in our frustration/horror/mockery. And even if we're just reposting a tweet, inevitably that's going to lead more people to the original tweet.   2) **It makes us believe that everyone on their side agrees with them.** In the same way that delving into abortion statistics reveals that the conservative (and liberal) rank and file have far more nuanced views than their most extremist flank, I find that talking to just about any conservative is more complex (and genuine) then the gotcha jabs and distorted statistics and extremist takes that people like Greene and Shapiro post. Yes, plenty of people agree with these crazies, but plenty don't.   3) **It makes us dumber.** Some of our beliefs might really benefit from some scrutiny. Some of our positions might be opposed by real evidence or persuasive rhetoric that's worth hearing out. But we'll never believe that as long as we mostly share and engage with the stupidest voices on the opposing side. I don't believe in a false equivalence, or endless devil's advocates, or needing to defend every belief, but I do think we can end up more smug or arrogant than we deserve if we only engage with moronic trolls.  4) **It makes us defined by our opposition.** This one's a bit more nebulous, but we know we live in a time of record \"anti-partisanship,\" where more people than ever before vote to stop the opposition's agenda rather than to advance their own. This usually encourages a type of legislative paralysis where we end up celebrating the status quo, because the goal was \"beat them and stop negative change\" instead of \"enact positive change.\" I think we'd just be healthier if we spent more time upvoting those we support and trumpeting their words and deeds rather than trashing those we oppose.   Anyway, that's all. I'm excited to hear the thoughts of others.", "output": "In the case of mainstream liberals (Republican and Democrat voters), you're right. Those people are building an ideology of contradiction, voting against policies instead of for them and building a belief set over opposition rather than reform.

First, because it opens the door for pointing out the bourgeois tactics hidden beneath PMC rhetoric, things that may be obvious to journalists, historians, and experienced leftists but not to younger people stuck in the Matrix. Second, because it shows solidarity among a minority, which helps people feel like they're not insane for eschewing rhetoric that demonizes their way of life, values, or even existence."}}

For example, the statement \"the Cold War would have been WW3 without the fear of nuclear fallout\" is a slippery slope because it assumes that the existence of nuclear weapons was the only factor preventing a third world war, without considering other potential factors that could have played a role.  3. **Hasty generalization:** This is the fallacy of drawing a conclusion about a group or category based on insufficient or unrepresentative evidence. For example, the statement \"there hasn't been a war between the big Nuclear states or World Powers since the invention of the Nuke\" is a hasty generalization because it assumes that the absence of war between these countries is a result of the invention of nuclear weapons, without considering other factors that may have contributed to this absence of war.  Now, let me try to answer to what you wrote:  1. The use of nuclear weapons in Japan killed hundreds of thousands of people and had long-lasting effects on the affected areas. Additionally, the decision to use nuclear weapons raised ethical concerns about the use of such devastating weapons, and has been the subject of much debate and discussion. Furthermore, the use of nuclear weapons in Japan may have set a dangerous precedent for the future use of these weapons, which could have had catastrophic consequences for humanity. Therefore, while it is possible that the use of nuclear weapons may have prevented a larger loss of life in the short term, their long-term consequences should also be considered.  2. It is not accurate to say that the existence of nuclear weapons was the only factor that prevented World War III. There are several reasons why this statement is incorrect:  - The presence of other military alliances and global superpowers: The Cold War was not just between the Soviet Union and the United States, but also involved other countries and military alliances, such as NATO, which played a role in preventing a full-scale global conflict.  - Economic and political relationships between countries: The Cold War was not just a military confrontation, but also involved economic and political relationships between countries. For example, the United States and the Soviet Union were both part of the United Nations, which provided a forum for diplomatic negotiations and conflict resolution.  - The role of diplomacy and international negotiations: Despite the tensions and confrontations of the Cold War, there were also efforts to avoid a full-scale conflict through diplomatic negotiations and international agreements, such as the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which aimed to limit the spread of nuclear weapons.  Therefore, while the fear of a nuclear conflict may have played a role in preventing a global war, it is not accurate to say that it was the only factor, and other factors such as the presence of other military alliances, economic and political relationships, and diplomatic efforts should also be considered."}}

{"item": {"input": "CMV: Parents who have no custody over their children should not be required to pay child support. So this comparison came up in another thread and I thought it was apt.   If a parent or parents decide they do not wish to keep their child they can relinquish it to the state and not be involved in its life.  The adoptive parents, assuming there are some, don't receive monthly child support checks from the biological parents.  We recognize that a biological parent who has no involvement in their spawn's life is not financially responsible for that child if they don't want to be.   This changes if only one parent wants responsibility but the other does not.  If Parent A says they have no interest in a child, but Parent B says they do, Parent A ends up paying Child Support to Parent B.  My argument is that for Parent A the decision is the same in both cases.  She or he is not involved in the child's life and has no custody.  The decision is the same on their part and therefore the result should be the same from that decision: they aren't financially liable.   The onus of raising a child should be on the parent(s) raising it, and not on the biological parent(s) who have no hand in raising the child.  _____  > *Hello, users of CMV!

If that's not the case, the next best thing is that the child has two parents who want to raise them, and are capable of giving them a good environment with some help. Since we don't hold any non-parent responsible for the existence of a child, there is no third party to look to for support; the state will step in rather than jeopardize a child's well-being.  If that's not the case, the next best thing is that the child has one parent who wants to raise them and needs no assistance.   If that's not the case, the next best thing is that the child has one parent who wants to raise them and needs some assistance. Since we hold both parents responsible for the existence of a child, the state would prefer the other parent provide this support if they are able, rather than distributing that burden to taxpayers.   If even that isn't the case, the next best thing is that the state takes custody of the child. This is preferable to leaving the child to be raised by someone who doesn't want them.   Child support isn't something a parent pays in return for access to their child; it's something they pay because the child has needs that must be met and our system isn't organized to have taxpayers pick up the tab for them."}}

Now, I\u2019m not arguing that those factors don\u2019t play a major role in election outcomes. My argument is rather that they do, and that fact is ridiculous. People shouldn\u2019t vote based on who is like \u201cthe everyday guy\u201d, or who has character. They should vote for people based on what they stand for, and how equipped they are for the job. I think that the reason at least many people care so much about what a candidate is like is because they are uninformed about what their candidates stand for, and so they go based on gut feeling and personal impressions as opposed to actual items of importance. I understand that personality is important to an extant. It helps politicians win over other politicians, and is helpful for anything involving negotiation. But it shouldn\u2019t be prioritized above the actual policies, and the fact that likeability is seen as more important is a major reason why we have so many political issues in America. _____ > *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

I'm going to work with this point right here. To be quite frank, I think politics in America are worse than they've been in a generation.   And why is that? Well, I'll point out that our leaders (Trump, Pence, McConnell, Pelosi) are historically unliked. We haven't had such unpopular leaders in a generation, either. Hillary was unliked as well. How long has it been since someone who a majority of people liked held power? That would be Barack Obama, a couple of years ago.   So it doesn't make a lot of sense to me to say the push to likability is creating political issues in America. If anything, I think the problem is that people care so much about their party winning they're willing to support politicians they don't particularly like. And sometimes, the reason someone is unlikable is that person has massive character flaws that render him unfit to lead. But that's all I'll say on that."}}

{"item": {"input": "Explain like I'm five years old: All these articles talk about the housing shortages and rising rents. Explain to me where all these people lived before! No article reports on this side and I\u2019m confused.", "output": "Typically you have people at various points in their housing lifecycle. Young people renting apartments, then buying condos or starter homes, having kids and upgrading to a family home, then downsizing to a retirement home when the kids move out and they get older, then perhaps into an assisted living or nursing home.  COVID threw those progressions off \u2014 old people stayed out due to outbreaks in assisted living facilities; empty nesters didn\u2019t want strangers in their homes or want to travel to shop for retirement homes in Florida and Arizona. And perhaps their single adult children decided to move home rather than be stuck alone in an expensive apartment in a shut down city.  But at the other end you had various people wanting to move up to the next housing stage because they wanted more space. So people who might have planned to buy a house in a year or two jumped into the hunt for a starter house or their upgrade to a bigger house when parents were working from home and kids were remote learning. So something like 3x as many people wanting to buy as usual, but half as many looking to sell as usual created a bottleneck in the housing market. If seniors don\u2019t downsize, then people in starter homes can\u2019t step up, and that means nonstarter homes for those wanting to buy their first homes.  Apartments are going up for a few reasons. One, people are returning to cities as vaccines are available and city life is more available. The rent deals to be had when people chose not to renew and moved back home with mom & dad in the suburbs last year are gone. And inflation means higher costs to maintain and keep up apartments, higher utility bills, causing landlord to raise rents to reflect cost increases.  And both home sales and rental apartments were affected by COVID causing delays in building, as things like permits and inspections took longer, building material shortages and skyrocketing prices, labor shortages all meant fewer new housing until being built to replenish obsolete ones, growing population of adults, etc."}}

Now, let's look at why glitter should not be available to the general public:  1) It's a pollutive nuisance - glitter can't be recycled, and using it on regular paper materials means those can't be recycled either. Glitter can make its way into waterways and from there via fish directly into the food chain. There are already record levels of microplastic contamination discovered in tap water.   2) It's a health hazard - glitter can irritate your skin, or make its way in to your eyes and even blind you. The British Medical Journal has urged doctors to look out for patients complaining of swollen eyes and vision loss after a 49-year-old woman was almost blinded after glitter rubbed off a Christmas card into her eye. It had formed into a clump, causing a lesion. According to Frank Kelly, a professor of environmental health at King\u2019s College London, \"[Glitter] could deliver chemicals to the lower parts of our lungs and maybe even into our bloodstream\".  3) It's dangerous to have around the house - the fact that glitter is sold to everyone willy-nilly means that parents buy it for their children, who are not the sturdiest of creatures at the best of times. Knock over glitter once, and your home is no longer hospitable. Vacuuming or sweeping can never collect all the glitter, and once you knock it over, it becomes an actual menace/hazard: babies and pets can ingest the glitter, it gets all over everything, and all members of the household will transport the glitter throughout the house, extending it's reach and range.  Glitter should be treated similar to any other chemical hazard which can cause drastic pollution, poison food chains, cause physical damage to multiple different systems of the body, and similar to some chemical agents and weapons, are extremely hard to purify an area once glitter begins to spread.

Certainly we associate femininity with the female sex, but that's exactly the reason why it affects men as well. The modern face of feminism is one that attempts to break down societal gender constructs, i.e. femininity = woman, masculinity = man, while empowering both men and women to rise above them.   I am a man but I've been an ardent femininist for my entire life, and it pains me to see ridiculous and often ill-informed opinions on one of society's most prevalent issues. Men seem to feel threatened by feminism, as if empowering women means to de-empower men. This is not true in the slightest! Any legitimate, academic discussion of feminism acknowledges that gender constructs affect men to a great degree, and I've yet to meet a single educated feminist who would disagree. I understand that there are radicalists in every movement out there, but fringe opinions do not affect my beliefs.  The men's rights movement (which I truly hope only exists on the internet) is unnecessary. Men have held positions of power for millennia - is it really necessary for us to feel better about being a man? Where feminism seeks to tear down the ideas of being male and female, men's rights activists (or should I say, soapbox preachers) seem to do nothing but boost male egos.

Much of what they have done has been a vast improvement, because women certainly did have a lot of problems that needed to be addressed.

(No one wants to make it fair by making things harder for girls.  They just want more done to help the boys.)  There is a presumption in divorce cases that the mother gets custody.  If a father gets custody, people assume the mother must have done something REALLY bad to forfeit it, because everyone just accepts that she \"should\" have it by default.  Mary Winkler murdered her husband and got away with it.  Claimed he was an asshole and that made it okay.  Try reversing the genders and see how that would have played out.  Domestic violence affects men, no one cares, they are supposed to \"man up\" and just deal with emotional and physical abuse.  Men get dirty looks and the cops get called when they play with their daughters in public, because there is a presumption of wrongdoing.  If a man paying child support loses his job, it doesn't matter: his child support payments aren't adjusted.  (Fuck deadbeat dads, seriously, fuck those guys, but this is fundamentally wrong, to MAKE someone a \"deadbeat\" by requiring the impossible, no matter how much they WANT to support their children but have reduced income?)  Rape in men's prisons.  It's treated as a joke or just punishment.  No matter how evil a person is, no one deserves rape.  No one.  Imagine if people joked about female rape like they do male rape.

Then there are the areas of \"female privilege.\"  These are areas where feminism is actively putting men down.  A woman has the privilege to call a man a creep and he will be shamed by women and by many men as well (the MRM calls them \"white knights,\" I personally don't like that term though).  A man is guilty of being a creep until he proves himself innocent.  There are indeed many creepy guys in the world, but justice is not served by having women be able to wield this \"thought-terminating clich\u00e9\" like a club.  They can silence dissenting opinions anytime they want to, by calling a man misogynist, or creepy, or whatever.  They are just considered right by default.  That's not okay.  False rape accusations.  There have been documented (as in caught on video) cases of women accusing a man of rape for petty or vindictive reasons, when he never even TOUCHED her so much as with a finger.  But these criminals are usually not prosecuted.  Feminists actively deny this is any kind of a problem.  They actively condemn the prosecution of women seeking to have men falsely imprisoned.  Men are just considered disposable.  Hillary Clinton said \"women have always been the primary victims of war.\"  I, personally, am lucky to live in a nice area, where I usually don't get shat on for being a guy.  Never got dirty looks when playing with my daughter.  Never got called creepy.  Have no plans to get divorced.  I do worry sometimes about pissing my wife off though, knowing that my happy life is based on her sufferance: if she WANTED to, she could divorce me tomorrow, take my house, and make it so I could hardly see my children again.  I don't fear her doing that, but it's unsettling to know that she COULD.  That the system, with all the guns, would side with her no matter what, because she's a woman.  That I'd have to have incontrovertible evidence to overcome the bias inherent in the system.  It happens.  It happens all the time.  I was giving a speech once, and I was using domestic violence as an example.  In my example, by the pronouns I used, it was a woman assaulting a man.  Everyone laughed.  No part of my speech was funny.  But the juxtaposition was to people, because \"everyone knows\" that domestic violence is men hitting women, so when the pronouns made it clear it was a woman attacking a man, the response was to laugh.  I don't need the MRM to boost my ego.  That has precisely nothing to do with anything.  My ego is nice and healthy, not too big, not too small, I think.  But the system is stacked against men in a lot of ways, legally and socially.  A lot of the ways don't affect me personally, but I hate INJUSTICE, and so I care about men's rights.  I've never had the cops called on me for taking my daughter into the bathroom at Toys R Us, but THAT HAPPENED to a man.  And people actually tried to remove her from him.  If the wife wasn't there to stop them, what would have happened when the man tried to fight back?  This shit is real and it happens and I hate it.  \"Men have held positions of power.\"  So what?  I'm not in a position of power.  MOST men aren't, and most men have never been.  The men in charge are a tiny group.  The majority of us are peasants.  Feminism doesn't care about me.  At all.  At all.  And if I say that, you know what I get?  \"Why SHOULD we care about you?  You have Male Privilege.  Stop whining!\"  Oh, whining.  Another thought-terminating clich\u00e9.  Another way to shut a person up, and not have to listen to the content of their words, no matter how calmly stated.  You know, I wouldn't mind having my feelings discounted by people, if they had the balls to admit that's what they were doing?  But it's when people SAY they care about equality and tolerance and helping others and sunshine and roses but it's all bullshit, because we don't have to care about THAT GUY because he's a creepy whiner and needs to man up, that is what really pisses me off."}}

He refused to get out of the car or acknowledge me. A few moments later, a police officer arrived. The other guy jumped out of his car, shook the officer's hand, and said, \"Thanks for coming, Dave.\"    The officer took his statement, and didn't say a word to me other than to ask me for my insurance card. He went back to his patrol car, walked over to me, and handed me a summons.    He said, \"You're receiving a citation for failure to yield. You can pick up the police report in 3-5 business days at the police station.\"    When I informed him that I had a green arrow and the other vehicle had, in fact, gone through a red light, he chuckled and said, \"The other driver is a Captain on our fire department. He's driven our engine safely through more intersections than you've ever seen. I don't want to hear it.\"    I replied, \"But I have...\"    He put his hand up in my face and said, \"You're not getting out of this by lying to me.

It says that when I questioned I did not dispute the other driver's account of the accident and was issued a summons.    What I was trying to tell the officer was that I have a dashcam that captured the entire accident. I rolled my windows down as soon as it happened so the audio is fairly clear. It shows us both stopped at the intersection, me entering the intersection with a green arrow, the other driver gunning it into the intersection (it doesn't capture the crash as it was from the side), me getting out and attempting to talk to the other driver, audio of the other driver calling the officer Dave, video of me giving the officer my insurance card, and then video of him handing me the summons and refusing to listen to my side.    The other driver has already filled a claim against my insurance. When they called and asked me what happened, I told them the truth and that I have the whole thing on video.

In Scotland, 95% of people on public transport and in shops wear masks. In England, about 2% seem to. The point of bringing this up, is to make the point that if we want people to wear masks, we do basically need to tell them they have to, as most people are too stupid to do it without the government telling them to.   As for the mask mandates themselves, I have never heard a good argument against them. I often hear people say things like \"oh so should we have mask mandates for the flu then\", I don't see how this is a counter. I would be happy to wear a mask for a few months in winter when the flu is most prominent, and if there is a particularly bad flu strain, then telling people to wear masks seems justifiable even if only to reduce money spent in healthcare, not to mention that hospitals often get overwhelmed in winter.  Other arguments I hear are \"muh government telling us to do things bad\", to which the obvious response is seatbelts and not being allows to drunk drive, both of which are things that have small chances to negatively affect other people or you, which you can't do.   There are medical exceptions, which I do think should be allowed, although maybe with a slightly higher burden of proof than we have now.

I have a set of recipes that I like, but they always call for heavy cream, which requires a drive to the store, limited selection of sizes, and doesn't get much use outside of said recipes in my home.  Conversely, my corner store 2 blocks from my house carries light cream, half/half and every other ingredient I would otherwise need for a basic recipe.  Can I safely substitute light cream or half/half (at different ratios) for the heavy cream, or is there some other chemistry involved that will affect the end result?  Example:  Depending on your sources,  * Heavy cream is ~36% fat. * Light cream is ~20% fat. * Half/half is ~12% fat. * Whole milk is ~3.5% fat.

Men and women play very different roles in conception, and, because of that, there\u2019s unfortunately never going to be a completely equal way of dividing the rights and responsibilities. With that said, pregnancy and parenthood are two very different things. Pregnancy is something only women have to go through. Parenthood is something both the man and the woman experience.   **In terms of pregnancy:**  Pregnancy is a women\u2019s *health* issue, and *only* women have to deal with the health impacts of pregnancy and childbirth, so only they have the ability to \u2018opt out\u2019 of it. Parental responsibilities, while they could be seen as a health issue in an abstract manner, are applicable to *both parties* once the pregnancy is over.   Here\u2019s what I mean when I say it\u2019s a women\u2019s health issue:   There\u2019s the obvious example of pregnancy threatening the mothers life, but that\u2019s not the main issue. Women, in general, even when controlling for known life threatening situations that were identified before birth, are 14 times more likely to die in childbirth than they are during an abortion.   Even if carrying a child to term does not result in death, pregnancy and childbirth takes a **massive** toll on women\u2019s bodies, and women should have the ability to do something before it takes said massive toll. I mean, pregnancy is 9 months of weight gain, fatigue, wild hormones, nausea, heartburn, constipation, peeing every 5 minutes, skin stretching, etc. and those are just the most common side effects of pregnancy. Then, obviously, childbirth is excruciatingly painful and risky. Then, after giving birth it\u2019s basically like recovering from surgery for 6+ weeks, combined with risks of other issues like postpartum depression. This is not something all women have the desire to go through, and even for those who do want to go through it, they might not want to go through it right now, and since it is their body, it is their decision to make about their health.   **In terms of parenthood:**   When there is a living breathing human being outside of the woman\u2019s body, things become a little more equal in terms of rights and responsibilities. And they are\u2014 if a woman relinquishes all parenting rights to a baby they just gave birth to, the father can still chose to raise that baby & sue the mother for child support.   So again, since men and women play very different roles in conception, there is never going to be a perfectly equitable way to determine rights and responsibilities.

{"item": {"input": "Explain like I'm five years old: Why have manual transmissions become replaced by paddle shifters and such? What are the benefits in terms of performance?", "output": "From my point of view in the 1980s manual transmissions had three major advantages over automatic transmissions:  1)Manuals were faster.  The automatic transmissions weren't slow but they did not allow for shifting at the highest RPMs, where an engine usually makes its highest horsepower.  This was borne out over and over in the testing records of the various car magazines.  2)Manuals gave more control.  Downshifting when I saw some stupid nonsense approaching gave me more options to do something with just my right foot: slow down with engine braking, maintain the same speed at a higher RPM, or accelerate out of the trouble by picking a line and threading the needle before it closes.  Until the Porsche Tiptronic came along, manually moving between an automatic's gears, like going from D to 2, was rough and harsh on the transmission.  Notice none of those options involve hitting the brakes, which before ABS could be a real problem.  Skidding would mean going straight into whatever you were aiming at when you hit the brakes.  As I became a better driver more advanced moves like double-clutching and speed shifting became options.  (Although I spent way more time trying to learn it and practicing and getting in trouble than I ever did getting *out* of trouble with those tricks!)  3) Manuals are less expensive all around.  The car itself was always cheaper if it had a manual, and not just because manual transmissions were cheaper to make.  Manuals usually came with a no-frills baseline package that drivers like me recognized as lighter weight and easier to fix.  That would include hand-cranked windows and a crummy radio you were likely to replace anyway.  There was less mechanical complexity in a manual, so it cost less to maintain and far less to fix, although nobody wanted to have to replace a clutch.  Steadily over the years much of that has changed.  Car brakes are awesome now and allow for control while emergency braking.  Total game-changer, that one.  Performance transmissions are computer controlled to shift at ideal points, far quicker than a human can throw a lever like a gearshift.  They will furthermore refuse to risk blowing the engine in a mis-judged double-clutch down two gears.  Manufacturing tolerances are so much better that a complex system like an automatic transmission can last the life of the car.  And the power.  Modern cars have lavish amounts of soupy torque and soaring horsepower that one could only dream of in the 1980s.  Sometimes far more power than a normal driver can manage with a manual transmission--that was part of the art of mastering race cars, and while many of us wanted to be that, we were not.  Sometimes it's just far more power than *any* manual transmission can manage.  If I could hop back into my tiny 1.6L Miata and toss it around the mountains like a toy, I surely would and to hell with safety.  But in the real world I would have to think rather seriously now about how a manual transmission is right on the verge of *giving up* safety, performance and control, instead of *increasing* it, like it so obviously used to be.  And I guess that right there underscored some attitude difference between drivers which I'm sure still helps define the automatic/manual divide.  Some drivers wanted to have more points of control so that they could be more in the moment of driving.  Others wanted to put less effort into (and pay less attention to) driving.  And looking back the ones I considered \"lazy\" weren't wrong.  They were coming to terms with the modern reality that for most people your car is sitting around in traffic, waiting.  Why would you want to row your car to work and back every day?"}}

Fryer oil is neutral in flavor.  It breaks down quickly, and smells like shit when it does. Fryer oil lasts longer.  It has more of a tendency to bubble over. Fryer oil has anti-foaming agents in it.  It polymerizes well, which is great for cast-iron. Shitty for deep fryers. Fryer oil comes off easily with a little degreaser.  It's expensive. Fryer oil (used to be), cheap.  It coagulates at low temperatures, so there is a greater than zero possibility of ignition when firing up from cold in certain models.

If you're just looking to add in the brown butter flavor I'll share a little trick I came up with back in my chef days: make brown butter normally, but add in powdered milk as well. When you're making brown butter it's the milk proteins that actually brown, so the milk powder will work in the same way and brown as well. You can then strain it off and use it as an ingredient, which adds an amazing flavor to practically anything."}}
{"item": {"input": "Why do socialist revolutions tend to result in totalitarian dictatorships? If you look at the USSR under Stalin, China under Mao, Cuba under Castro, or even going back to the French Revolution and Robespierre, it always seems like socialist or communist revolutions result in a totalitarian strong man seizing power and causing terrible oppression and suffering to the people that live there. Why is that? Is there something fundamentally wrong with the political philosophy that lends itself to this? Or is it because these revolutions will oftentimes go too far, and try to erase the social and political systems that have maintained order in those countries for hundreds or even thousands of years (i.e. getting rid of the monarchy and religious institutions at the same time and replacing them with entirely new and untested systems and ideologies.) Or is there some other reason? Has there ever been a communist country where this didn't happen, and the government functioned reliably for a long time and the people enjoyed a high standard of living?", "output": "Social scientists often draw a distinction between *political* revolutions, which seek to change the government, and *social* revolutions, which seek to more basically transform social relations.  Theda Skocpol makes this distinction in her book *States and Social Revolutions*, which continues to be the most widely cited book on revolutions.  The classic example of the former is the American Revolution, where primarily the government changed, and the later the French Revolution, where the whole social world of the *Ancien Regime* came crumbling down.  I think what you're seeing here is the checkered history of social revolutions more than anything intrinsic to socialism.  I wrote in old post:  >Social scientists sometimes separate out two different kinds of revolutions: social revolutions like the French, Russian, Turkish, Chinese, Cambodian, etc Revolutions which seek to change everything, and political revolutions like the American, the Glorious, the Jasmine, Egyptian, etc. Revolutions which seek to change politics, but not culture or social relations more broadly.  You may be interested in older posts of mine.  Here, I talk about the origin of the term \"revolution\", and how \"revolution\" didn't really mean *revolution* until the French Revolution.  Here, I short piece about the distinction between social and political revolutions, a distinction that interestingly was first proposed by Trotsky.  Here, I have a much longer bit about revolutions more generally, including an alternative typology between \"tipping point revolutions\" and \"state breakdown revolutions\", with particularly reference to the revolutions of the Arab Spring.  The thing I think that should be emphasized is that we generally ee political revolutions as good (the American Revolution, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Glorious Revolution in England) and we often see periods of rapid social change as good (the end of Jim Crow or Sexual Revolution in America, or the Quiet Revolution in Quebec), but when a political revolution seeks to usher in a rapid period of social change, be it from the left or the right, we often see massive destruction.  The conscious effort to change social relations is generally better at destroying the old order than building a new one.  Occasionally, you have ones that combine both successfully, like the Turkish Revolution, but in those cases it's often not clear how much the social changes occur outside of the big cities.  Books like *Republic of Empire*, about a small, provincial town in the Black Sea region, suggest that the social revolution was mostly restricted to places like Ankara and Istanbul.  Though Burkean Conservatism typically valorizes the existing order and seeks to stop change (think William F. Buckley's famous definition, \"A conservative is someone who stands athwart history, yelling *Stop*, at a time when no one is inclined to do so, or to have much patience with those who so urge it\"), there are \"Right Wing\" attempts at Social Revolutions that one could categorize as \"right wing\" and were equally destructive and totalitarian.  The Iranian Revolution, an attempt to instill firm religiousness in both state and society, is an obvious example.  Nikki Keddi and Theda Skocpol have a good back and forth about the Iranian Revolution does fit Skocpol's social revolution model.  Skocpol's article is called \"Rentier State and Shi'a Islam in the Iranian Revolution\", Keddi's article is simply called \"Comments on Skocpol\".  A summary of Skocpol's argument can be found [here](A conservative is someone who stands athwart history, yelling Stop, at a time when no one is inclined to do so, or to have much patience with those who so urge it.).  Both are mainly about the sequence that led to the revolutionaries' success, rather than the social consequences of the revolutionaries' success.  The Taliban's social revolution, or more shockingly recent, ISIS's social revolution, are other examples of religious revolutionaries coming to power and changing not just the manner of rule, but the manner of how people are allowed to relate to each other.  The fascists are another interesting of social revolution from the right.  While when we study the Nazis, we tend to think of them in terms of their murderous regime and their invasions and war-mongering, at home they also had great effects even on ethnic German life.  Shmuel Eisenstadt wrote both an article and a book about the \"multiple modernities\", about how communism, liberal democracy, and fascism all presented very different visions of modern social and political life.  My favorite book on the social effects of the Nazi social revolution is German sociologist Tilman Allert's *the Hitler Salute*.  It focuses on just how greetings changed, but uses this to delve into how the Nazis changed daily life and basic social relations.  So, in short, while political revolutions have a mixed record of long term success, social revolutions--whether from the left or the right--have a pretty poor record.  When socialist parties come to power (and willing leave power) through democratic elections (as in much of Europe), you have very different outcomes."}}

If a question is closed then it isn't really an issue for philosophers to investigate. So, for instance, all philosophers agree that the world is round and that the gods don't cause rain and that earthquakes aren't caused by wind inside the earth and that evolution explains the diversity of life we see (although at one point in time philosophers didn't agree on these things and they were live philosophical issues)."}}

I tend to stick pretty close to the 3.5 rule, but have hired lower GPA candidates if they interview well and would be a good fit for the team.  This year especially, I have received significant amounts of praise for my new hires and how smoothly they have transitioned into the roles as opposed to the person who previously hired for my team, and I feel this is directly a result of my stricter interviews and hiring criteria.   Given that we tend to interview a lot of college students, I do look at their GPAs as I feel it is a direct reflection on their work ethic.

{"item": {"input": "I live in Washington State. Can I be prosecuted for gifting my terminally ill father a firearm? Throwaway for obvious reasons.  My father is, and has been, very sick for about a year. He was diagnosed with two different forms of aggressive, untreatable lymphomas. He has nerve death in his feet from years of alcohol abuse (been clean for about 8 years, though!). He had to have his spleen removed earlier this year, and he has several other health issues that I'm not particularly familiar with because I'm not a doctor and don't understand the terminology, most of which are related to his cancers.  For the year+ since his first cancer diagnosis, he's been pretty elevated about the whole deal. He's made it very clear to my siblings, my stepmother, and I that he does \\*not\\* want a long, drawn-out old person death. He already has a DNR/DNI order on his chart, and has repeatedly said to all of us that he's happy with the way his life shook out and he's ready to leave the world. This was when he knew he was terminally ill, but was still relatively healthy and mobile.  Well, last week he had a major health crisis. Because I'm not a doctor I don't really understand the details, but the MAST cells in his system caused an enormous anaphylactic reaction that caused his blood pressure to drop. He also had an infection in his lungs that needed to be treated with an aggressive course of antibiotics. Worst, though, was that something about this incident triggered four different strokes. Three were relatively minor, but the fourth was a medium-to-large-sized event.  My sister, stepmother, and I have been taking shifts with him in the hospital since the event. He's having trouble finding words, but is still capable of expressing himself for the most part. Through all the physical therapy, medications, and hours of sitting in a hospital room, he has made it absolutely clear that the lifesaving interventions we put him through after the stroke were way too much and he would rather die than go through any of it again. He has begged us to change his physician's order for life saving treatment (POLST) form to specify that he should not receive treatment for similar events in the future.  The thing that's driving me nuts about this situation is that our stepmother (who has durable power of attorney) is having a very easy time dismissing these statements as \"oh he's just depressed\" and has been dragging her feet on changing the POLST form and other preparations to fulfill his wish of getting the fuck out of the hospital, back to his retirement home, and getting a chance to say bye to his family and friends before going through the lengthy process of a physician assisted suicide. My sister (who's in medical school) believes that he won't get to the point of a PAS, and believes he'll go next time he has a similar event like the one he had. The big issue I'm concerned about is whether this event happens before the POLST form is changed. If that happens, and he's saved again to come back in an even more disabled state, my father is going to die hating us, and I can't live with that.  Things REALLY came to a head yesterday at the hospital. I'd never seen my dad cry before in my life. I'd also never seen him get so angry. Before my stepmother got there, he begged me to bring him a gun so he has a way out in case things got even worse. Even with his speech impaired from the stroke, he told my stepmother and me in no uncertain terms that he hated us for being so selfish and cruel by keeping him around.  I doubt my father would put a bullet in his head if he had a gun. I think he just wants one so he knows that if things get too unbearable, he knows he can end it all in a split second, rather than having to hold on and wait for another stroke, or heart attack, or infection to end everything, or waiting for the gears of the state to slowly turn to the point where he can have his PAS. But I believe that everyone on earth should have the agency to decide when, where, and how they die, and he is and clearly has been suffering horribly for the last week and a half.  If I were to roll to the gun store and get him a firearm, and he shot himself with it, what would be the legal ramifications for me? I'm okay with my family hating me and even being vindictive. I'm a financially independent adult, so I'm not concerned about any sort of aid being cut off. But if there's a chance of me being prosecuted for this act, I won't do it.

{"item": {"input": "CMV: Refusing to engage with someone who has different views to you is a sign that you don't know what you are talking about I am someone who really enjoys discussions and I can find myself on either side of an argument depending who I am talking to. I will often play the devils advocate, and if I'm talking to someone who is (for example) pro-choice, then I'll take the pro-life perspective, and viceversa.  Because I do this so often, I encounter some people who will respond with anger/disappointment that I am even entertaining the views of the \"opposite side\". These discussions are usually the shortest ones and I find that I have to start treading more and more carefully up to the point that the other person doesn't want to discuss things any further.   My assessment of this is that the person's refusal to engage is because they don't know how to respond to some of the counter-points/arguments and so they choose to ignore it, or attack the person rather than the argument. Also, since they have a tendancy to get angry/agitated, they never end up hearing the opposing arguments and, therefore, never really have a chance to properly understand where there might be flaws in their own ideas (i.e., they are in a bubble).   The result is that they just end up dogmatically holding an idea in their mind. Whatsmore, they will justify becoming angry or ignoring others by saying that those \"other ideas\" are so obvisouly wrong that the person must be stupid/racist/ignorant etc. and thus not worth engaging with. This seems to be a self-serving tactic which strengthens the idea bubble even more.", "output": "I am splitting this into two responses because I think these were different enough ideas to warrant it.  I see similar views to yours quite often, that this comes down to a simple difference of opinion, that not being willing to engage with people who hold certain views means living in a bubble and not being willing to listen to anyone who disagrees.  One of my first reactions to this is to ask if you truly, honestly, think there is no topic that's basically settled.  If someone expresses support for white supremacy, unambiguously, is it worth it to talk to them?  Specifically, what ideas of theirs are going to be worth thinking about?  The ones where black people are thugs?  The ones where white people shouldn't intermarry?  But of course the world isn't so black and white, often white supremacists will deny being one, while still trying to make arguments that, while more benign on the surface, ultimately lead back to the ones from the previous paragraph.  This is where I come to my second question: do you really think people haven't heard a lot of the arguments before?  Like I personally have dealt with this most with regards to gender issues, specifically with mras.  At this point, I've heard their arguments, heard what they have to say, and within a sentence or two know what route they are going to take to spread their bullshit.  If I hear something truly new, I would stop and listen, even if I know someone who identifies as an mra is likely going to get back to saying bullshit, but frankly, I don't hear anything new.  There comes a point where it is completely justified to accept that a certain group is going to continue to behave the way they have been.  The third thing I want to point out is that just from the one example you list of topic, these conversations often involve things that cause serious harm to people.  The anti-choice perspective hurts women, hurts babies (because the anti-choice side does not actually give a shit about people once they are born, as we can see simply by looking at what kind of government policies they put in place), while providing no actual upside (abortions don't go down, just safe ones).  It's not surprising for people to be extremely upset about the topic.  You mention racism in your final paragraph, and there too, racism literally denies the humanity of people.  Of course people who face racism, especially systemic racism, will get upset if you take a pro-racism stance.  Now you may want to come back to me by saying that people disagree with how I portray this, and that's true.  The thing is, I have listened to both sides of this argument, and come to a conclusion.  Listening to both sides, deciding that anti-choicers are hurting people with no other upside, and not finding any use to listening to the same arguments from them over and over isn't \"dogmatically holding an idea.\"  That's called \"coming to a conclusion.\"  The final thing I want to point out is related to, but slightly different from my second point: if someone isn't willing to articulate the why, isn't willing to walk through or isn't good at explaining all the lines of reasoning that get to the conclusion of \"that's so obviously wrong that person must be stupid/racist/ignorant,\" does that actually mean they live in a bubble?  I know I frequently have moments where someone says something and I realize they have just expressed an idea I wasn't able to.  That is, the thought was already in my head, the reasoning there, but I couldn't figure out the right combination of words to properly express the idea.  Does that mean I was wrong before I figured out how to express the idea?  I....think that's pretty clearly wrong."}}

How could we microscopically differentiate between a material at high voltage and low voltage?  I used to think that the high voltage wire would be positively charged and the low voltage one would be negatively charged (again, these are REAL wires so they can hold a little bit of charge).

Throughout 2016's election, I saw a crazy number of articles from left-leaning sources about how liberals needed to \"reach across the aisle\" and attempt to truly understand why someone might vote for Donald Trump. We were asked to conceptualize their struggles and empathize with their suffering, to acknowledge their humanity and their pain.  Vox beseeched liberals to listen to Trump voters' concerns. The Atlantic profiled Trump supporter after Trump supporter to dispel the conventional wisdom that they were all racist boomers or antisocial white nationalists. USA today did the same. 538 did repeated statical analysis to disprove those stereotypes. The New York Times told us to \"stop shaming Trump voters\". The Washington Post suggested we empathize with Trump voters. Hell, even the quite literally Socialist magazine Jacobin made the same request.  Meanwhile, reviews of books about rural white working class society became vehicles for left-leaning publications to ask readers to feel pity for the underserviced social sectors that became Trump voters. \"Hillbilly Elegy\" and \"Strangers In Their Own Land\", for example.  My question, then is this: Why isn't the Right held to the same standard?   Where is the Fox News op-ed about how Trump voters need to work to understand the root cause of BLM? When hasn't the Wall Street Journal ever profiled an Antifa member or a climate activist or even just a bunch of Biden voters in general?

Hardness just tells you whether or not one material will scratch another; that is not what dulling is  Dulling is what happens when a thin edge (like a blade) folds over itself. That's related to the material of the edge, the thinness of it, and the amount of force being applied to it.   I could push my blade flat through water, and it would eventually dull it; It's the metal being too malleable at that thickness that causes it to dull.  Now, could you make it out of a less malleable material? Totally. But malleability is a sliding scale; The opposite of malleable is brittle.  I'd prefer my blades not hold an edge indefinitely, if the alternative is that they can snap or shatter under pressure.  On an unrelated note tho, keep in mind that hair is not weak. Your hair and fingernails are made of keratin; That's the same thing that reptile scales, hooves and horns are made of; It's very strong.   The issue is that our hair and nails are really thin.

Questions regarding strength, weight, and cost for cars Howdy -   I was thinking about future fuel regulations today and thinking about how the industry will meet them.

Hybrid drive trains are certainly a big possibility, especially if a consumer friendly KERS system is developed or battery tech takes off.

The numbers in the title are from this source: http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/natural-disasters/lightning-profile/", "output": "**TL;DR the TL;DR**: In very specific conditions, it's possible for the electricity to flow around you. This causes severe burns, but can leave you alive if you're lucky.  -----------------------------------------------------  **TL;DR:** Often when lightning strikes a person, the person is wet. If the layer of water is less resistive than your internal organs, most of the current will flow through the layer of water. It'll heat up and burn you, but it doesn't necessarily kill you.   Also, often times lightning strikes in the vicinity of a person, but not the person directly. This usually means they'll get current flowing through their legs, but not across their heart, which usually isn't fatal. Again, serious burns will occur.  One more thing that contributes to this all is the fact that a fast changing current (like the short burst of a lightning strike) tends to flow through the outermost layer of whatever is conducting it, furthering the tendency to flow through the water/skin instead of your heart.  Also read /u/bearpics16's comment below. It explains the physiological changes lightning strike burns cause, which often result in death.  -----------------------------------------------------  **Longer explanation**  Something \"containing\" a certain amount of volts really doesn't convey well how it all works.  The voltage (or potential) is a measure for the difference in electric charge between two things. So when we say, there's 3.7V **across** a battery, that's a measure of how much work can be done when a certain amount of _electricity_ (charge) is moved from one terminal to the other.  The bigger the voltage, the harder the electrons try to go from one place to the other (which is why the water pressure analogy often is used). Dry air can  insulate about 3000V (3kV) per mm (about 76.2 kV per inch). So if you put two conductors 1 cm apart and put over 30kV across them, the air will start conducting. When this happens, the electricity will ionize the air, creating plasma. This is the spark you see.   Lightning is just a bigger version of that process, where the air in the clouds is electrically charged. This electricity tries to jump to anything with a lower charge. If the voltage across the air/ground gap is big enough, the electricity can flow across he gap.  Now, what you need to understand is that electricity only kills if you get enough of it flowing at once through the wrong parts. The amount of electricity flowing **through** something is the current or amperage.    People always say that it's not the volts, but the amps that kill you. In reality, there's more to it. You need enough voltage to get enough current flowing to hurt you. Your body has a certain resistance to electricity flow. (current = voltage / resistance).   What's also important is the path the electricity takes. A big-ass current flowing from the tip of you finger to the palm of your hand will give you a nasty burn, but it won't stop your heart from beating. A small zap flowing from one arm to the other might do that more effectively.  You also need to know that electricity will ~~follow~~ prefer the path of least resistance. If there's multiple paths available, the current flowing through each will be inversely proportional to each path's respective resistance.  Another thing is that a lightning strike behaves a lot like AC (it's DC, but the short burst nature makes it adopt behaviors from AC). One of the things AC does, is that it will flow through the outermost layer of whatever is conducting it. This is called the _skin effect_. This means that if you're the conductor, it'll prefer flowing around your internal organs, if your skin's resistance isn't too high.  Thus, if lightning strikes you when you have a layer of water all over your body (it's raining, most likely), that water might be conducting enough to keep most of the electricity from even entering your body. It just flows through the layer of water on your skin.  A lightning strike will heat that water up a lot, though. So you'll probably have some serious burns. But if there isn't an appreciable amount of electricity flowing through your heart, chances are you'll live to tell the story.   --------------------------------------  EDIT: corrected breakdown voltage for air, thanks /u/yanroy. Also, RIP inbox  EDIT2: ~~it's both~~ there's more to it. I realize this is dumbed down.

{"item": {"input": "CMV: \"Cancel culture\" and changing cartoon characters is mostly a way for white people to virtue signal/be \"saviors\" 1) The FSU Seminoles and the Chicago Blackhawks have *specific permission* from those tribes to use those names - yet they constantly get badgered by people not even in those tribes to change the name and that it's racist. I am referring to those two teams specifically, because they have that permission from tribal council - if those tribes allow it, who are we to tell them to change it?  2) I understand that it is extremely hard for POC voice actors to break into the profession. However, that needs to be reminded by new character being created & cast, not white voice actors being pushed out a job they've held for years to not get \"cancelled.\" The majority of people who were calling for the man who voiced Cleveland to step down were white. I also understand that  On that note, I believe that we need to defer to POC/minorities when a certain character is in question - Speedy Gonzales is a good example. White people pushed for his removal while Mexicans and Mexican-Americans protested for him to stay! It's not for us, people who are not in that community, to decide whether a character is good or bad. The creator of Ghost in the Shell LOVED the casting of Scarlett Johansson - which was accurate anyway because the robot that the main character resides in is outwardly European - casting an Asian woman would've been inaccurate to the story. But who complained? White Americans!  3) Dragging videos/tweets/etc made years or even a decade plus ago by famous people or influencers does nothing and implies that society as a whole refuses to forgive such transgressions and that there's no reason to try and strive to be better because it won't be believed anyway - especially when they've already apologized for it and there's no other instances of such behavior recently. Jenna marbles got bullied off of YouTube for videos she made almost a DECADE ago and had already apologized for, and there were no other questionable videos since then. What, then, is the point of dredging it up years later?  I feel the same with issues involving cultural appropriation - I constantly see white people putting down other white people for *appreciating* a culture I stead of appropriating it, when POC aren't even complaining about that specific issue - did the Polynesian people care that little white girls wanted to be Moana for Halloween, or did WHITE PEOPLE care so they could look enlightened?  In conclusion, I understand that, as we have privilege, we need to use our voices to help POC and minorities. But I believe there are two main issues:  - We end up talking OVER them and trying to tell them what they should be offended by, which implies they're not intelligent enough to decide by themselves/is incredibly infantilizing.  - We pull years old tweets and attack influencers and celebrities while refusing to believe that they have changed in the years since and also see that behavior as problematic now in an attempt to virtue signal and act like a good person.  I just really don't think that this is the way to legitimately help POC - obviously if they also agree there is an issue that's not the case, but I also think that problematic behavior from the past should be forgiven if that person has worked to become better - but we refuse to believe that it's not a publicity stunt when they do.", "output": "Here is my take on cancel culture and why it is not just white Americans that push for it.   The examples you gave I am not 100% familiar with so I apologize from the beginning of the circumstances are different. Also, there are many teams that have had permission to use certain names and likenesses. So here I go.   I grew up in projects and was raised on welfare and government assistance as a white male. When I was growing up the biggest race issues were not as they are today. I am an 80\u2019s baby. I looked up to many black people whom we now refer to as POC. I looked up to Tupac, will smith, Dr.Dre, and Bone thugs and harmony. But when I watched movies, tv, etc. I didn\u2019t see a good representation of POC then. I would see \u201cwhite shows\u201d and \u201cblack shows\u201d everything was divided and that was not vary good because when I was with my friends nothing signified my friends. Where there were 1 white kid and 4 black kids and 1 Spanish kid. So some people growing up felt guilty about that, just as I did. I just named my teenage idols but I had 100\u2019s to pick from of white people. So now we are here today and wonder how we got here. How did cartoons get banned, how is it now that ghost busters does an all women cast and people loose their minds, or cartoons get pulled because some people thought it was offensive. You see the way society growth works is through change. We had to change and get a better representation of everyone. Yes people have went a little to far but that is how growth works. It\u2019s sloppy right now and it will get back in order. Yes we shouldn\u2019t pull up people\u2019s past and bash them with it, but I really think that we aren\u2019t bashing the people that made jokes or slightly offensive stuff. It seems as though we are bashing the culture of its okay to say really hurtful stuff. The same things you joke with your friends and family isn\u2019t okay in a public display. That is the point that I think we are attempting to get to. Just a place where if a character is a certain race let that be played by that race. Right now 99% of characters are white so let us redesign some for other races. But let us leave their roles alone. Also, the drugging up of history shows that we are trying to correct the root problem where it\u2019s not okay to say things that are inappropriate in the public eye. We all do have the freedom to express ourselves but we can\u2019t choose how others will react to that.   I really hope I shed some light on why cancel culture is not all bad and why it\u2019s not just white people complaining for no reason. Just take wrestling for an example. In the 80\u2019s -early nineties the POC were not the major world champions until Ron Simmons. That was because there were a mass majority of white people watching. Yes, my friends and I rooted for who we liked but just like me loving hip hop, when Eminem came around all the white kids were happier because we had representation. Now look at it. White rappers, female rappers, etc. It really helps us all overtime when we have a better representation, I believe.   If I completely missed the point. I am sorry. I just wanted to show you another view point. Thanks for reading."}}

Generally speaking, I don\u2019t think highly of most people who are against welfare/social programs, but the argument that makes the least sense to me is the \u201cmy money shouldn\u2019t go towards something that doesn\u2019t benefit me/I shouldn\u2019t have to pay more for someone else to get xy\u201d.  For the sake of this argument let\u2019s ignore that helping the less fortunate has a positive effect on society and thus benefits all members as they clearly don\u2019t believe that.  According to the dictionary, selfish means \u201clacking consideration for other people; concerned chiefly with one's own personal profit or pleasure\u201d, so I think it\u2019s pretty clear that the people who think along these lines are selfish.  I also think that they are not the smartest either, as a selfish but logical person would see that the best option for them is to have the security of an available and accessible welfare network even if they won\u2019t need it. Let\u2019s look at the options:  A. *There is no welfare system in place and you would\u2019ve needed it.* Clearly a bad situation.  B. *There is no welfare system in place and you never end up needing it.* Congratulations, you were lucky. However, you lived your life knowing that your luck might not hold and you\u2019re just one unexpected event away from being in a situation where you could have benefited from a safety net. You had an accident/got sick and now you\u2019re disabled/can\u2019t work? Too bad. You found out you\u2019re pregnant but can\u2019t afford to raise the child as a single parent? Tough luck. You were on a family trip, got in a car crash, and now your child is an orphan? Sucks to be them. There was an earthquake and everything you own is destroyed? Hope you don\u2019t mind.  C. *There is a welfare system in place and you end up needing it.* It\u2019s great that there was help available but it sucks that you fell on hard times. Not an ideal situation.  D. *There is a welfare system in place and you never end up needing it.* Most ideal situation. You lived a relatively comfortable life with the added reassurance that, were something to change, you wouldn\u2019t be on your own.  **Thus, my view is that on top of being selfish, they are not the smartest either as, all other things being equal, having the safety net of social welfare and not needing it is the best/most logical option.**  Ideally, I would like my view changed on both aspects, but proving that they are either not selfish or smart is also ok.  Arguments that I heard before/won\u2019t change my mind:  *People are responsible for their own lives/they should have prepared/they should have been more responsible/etc*. I\u2019m not talking about rich people who can fall back on their money/their family\u2019s money. In reality, most average people are one tragedy away from homelessness/poverty/hardship. I wish I could find that reddit post where the guy was explaining how it took 5 months after his wife\u2019s cancer diagnosis to lose 20 years' worth of savings and to have to remortgage their home. Basically, you can do everything right and still find yourself in a difficult position.  *There is/could be an option E in which such systems/programs are not needed to begin with.* I don\u2019t think that\u2019s plausible.  *Option B is preferable over D for said people because the possibility of their own misfortune bothers them less than the idea of someone else benefiting from their taxes.* This just proves that they are selfish and dumb for thinking that it\u2019s a good idea to sink the ship they are on just so the captain drowns.  *Option B is the best for them because they are not worried/they don\u2019t think it possible that they could be in the shoes of the less fortunate.* That just shows a total lack of empathy and awareness, assuming that just because they don\u2019t need it now, they\u2019ll never need it in the future proves they are not smart.

This is ignoring the cost of that security. It is like saying anyone who doesn't have insurance is stupid' when they might assess it as the cost of paying a monthly premium for a service they are unlikely to need is not worth the potential payout. That they would be better saving their money to cover an unexpected cost than paying for something that might not happen. I dont pay for phone insurance- I dont consider the cost/benefit worth it. Whether you agree or not that isn't an implicitly stupid stance to take.   When viewing this issue purely selfishly' it is an issue of risk analysis and cost/benefit. Someone in a secure position may not consider protecting against a low risk worth the cost. Using your examples' in scenario B/D their assessment was correct and purely selfishly they were correct to not want to finance a welfare system they didn't use.

We also enjoy very defined relationships with our patients with the relationship starting and ending over the course of 1 - 2 hours. The impact of our role is still too much for many people.   I cannot fathom how hard vets and vet staff have it.   Clinics are either small with a limited number of practitioners, with long and drawn out relationships with patients who can't talk and owners who can't seem to listen. It's not like there is a bar that vets get to hang out in and debrief. They go home and think about their ongoing cases and get up in the middle of the night to continue working on them. It must be lonely and it must be consuming.   I understand the risks with my boy, and that's why I was so quick to get him back to care when his situation changed. My dogs are my world, and a big part of my coping mechanisms for dealing with my work related stressors. It doesn't matter if it is 3pm or 3am when I walk through the door... I always get greeted with love. When I am in a dark place, I have 2 labs ready to retrieve me. I can't express what loosing one unexpectedly would do to me.

{"item": {"input": "Why did COVID go from variants to sub-variants? Can anyone explain to me why did we had variant after new variant of COVID for about 1,5 year but then suddenly stopped at Omicron. Why did it start creating sub-variants instead of new variants?   Question popped into my head when I saw an article about a new BQ.1 subvariant", "output": "What you\u2019re asking is why, at first, the new variants arose from the same starting point, while now the new variants are arising from each other. In other words they started off by going   * A  -> B  * A  -> C * A  -> D  whereas now they are going  * D -> E -> F -> G  In these scenarios, B, C, and D would be what you\u2019re calling \u201cvariants\u201d, and E, F, and G are \u201csubvariants\u201d. (This is greatly simplified, of course.).   The big picture answer is that those are the best-adapted viruses. As to why the best adaptations happened this particular way, it\u2019s partly speculation, but it\u2019s probably because the unusual nature of omicron gives it *and its variants* a transmission advantage over the other paths that could be followed.   Omicron almost certainly arose in an immunocompromised person - perhaps someone with partially controlled HIV, for example. The person had antibodies against the infecting virus, but wasn\u2019t able to completely eliminate the infection (perhaps because they didn\u2019t have enough active T cells). That gives the infecting virus a very strong selection for avoiding antibodies, so it accumulates a whole range of mutations.    What\u2019s more, this virus arose in an increasingly immune world - not so much because of vaccination (it arose in an almost non-vaccinated population) but because of prior infection. That gave omicron an enormous transmission advantage over all the previous variants, that didn\u2019t have as many mutations and were less able to deal with population immunity.   (As a side note, since vaccination gives better immunity than infection, the rise of omicron could possibly have been prevented if vaccine companies and developed countries had overcome their greed and selfishness and lived up to the agreements they\u2019d made to deliver vaccines to the whole world.)  Now, new mutations arising in omicron family members are able to build on the backbone that each previous mutation has accumulated. This is the pattern we see with influenza, for example - a series of accumulating mutations, finally culminating in one variant that has a distinct transmission advantage over the others that takes over and then itself starts to accumulate new mutations."}}

First I would ask about WHAT YOUR DELIVERABLES ARE. Ask for as much of a specific/detailed deliverable. (ex: increase first pas yields by 8% in year one). Simply put, in ONE sentence, do you know what your BOSS/CEO, hired you for?  2. if no, figure it out... follow up with the CURRENT STATE. In all the disorder, there is some order of which they get things done, start by letting your boss/management know that you will spend a few weeks (or months depending on the organization), understanding what the current state is.  Note, this should be done first on your deliverables, or it can become too big. (Ex: what is the current first pass yield? Is it accurate, how do we measure it? Is there historical data? What does it say? if they can't answer these simple questions it's okay, it's the foundation. It DOESN\"T MATTER WHAT IS ON PAPER, IT'S WHAT IS ACTUALLY THE CURRENT STATE (who cares if they say they have 97% first pass yield, if they're not even recording it, so they can't verify it, they don't know) 3. Clearly define your current problem. Yes again. 4. Verify that is the problem you are going to solve... again, with your stakeholder, 5. Ask yourself again, is this really the current state, and is this really the problem I'm solving.  If so, you have your baseline. 6. Okay, if 1000000% on number 5, the rest might come easy. Do a Root cause analysis (use fish.bone, parretto... etc.) Start with solving the biggest impact root cause First. 7. One change at a time... your low hanging fruits are best also, as long as you are solving root cause 8. implement the new \"solution\" for the SPECIFIC ROOT CAUSE. BEWARE: WATCH IT LIKE IT'S A PREMATURE BABY ON LIFE SUPPORT. FOCUS ON CAREFULLY OVERLY WATCHING YOUR IMPLEMENTED \"SOLUTION\" Specifically, it doesn't matter what change you make, if people don't follow it... make it easy to follow, how?? LET THEM TELL YOU HOW THEY WILL FIX THE DEFINED PROBLEM, let them OWN their solution, this is called BUY-IN. The document, and analyze what happened with those change, think, is this solving the problem? creating more problems?  9. if you can sustain it for a probably/normally 90 days then you should have solved your issues, and gotten results, that are measurable. The controlling part is more on validation and verification that the solution works, and a new current state... which if out of control, you should have a \"what to do process\" if it's not.  Repeat,  and repeat.... the number one thing I would say is, if you're not going to deliver what THEY want, value added or not, then you are not fixing their problem. once you deliver what they want, slowly, you will gain respect/credibility and hopefully freedom to address other more cultural change, but only if you plan on being there 5-10 years (no joke)   &#x200B;  Good luck, and God Speed"}}

The apartment I found is a small efficiency in an older building.  They agreed to a standard lease for the first six months, followed by month to month lease.  I was to be the first tenant, when I toured it six weeks ago, workers were painting the rooms.  The landlords son is living upstairs, and this is my landlords first time renting.  The lease was obviously pulled from a form and seemed standard.  There is a clause in the lease which states that I can't install curtains rods or hooks.  This seemed standard as well, I had similar at my old apartment.  I assumed there would be some sort of curtain provided, and this was in regards to additional curtains.  I moved in Sunday, and found the landlord had not installed curtains at all.  At this point, I assumed the issue with curtains was the potential to damage to the wall.  So, I bought tension rods that require no hardware and used them to hang curtains.  Monday afternoon I got a text from my landlord saying I needed to remove the curtains.  The building is on a street corner with a fair amount of foot traffic.  Between the four windows, you can see all of my apartment with the exception of the portion of the bathroom with the toilet and tub.  Not only does this mean I have no privacy, but the neighborhood is slightly sketchy after dark.  The nearby buildings have bars on their windows.  Anyone passing by not only can see my possessions, but whether or not I am home.  I expressed this to the landlord in my reply over text.  He replied to reread my lease.  I left them up overnight.  I had orientation this morning and came back to find the curtains removed and no where in the apartment.  I discovered this before entering the building, as two guys were outside one of my windows and looking in my apartment.  They left when I entered the building.  I messaged the landlord saying he didn't have the right to enter the apartment and asked for the curtains back.  He again said to check my lease and then commented that I needed to finish unpacking as it looked messy in my apartment.  I had to head to a work event so I couldn't follow through more, but I moved my electronics to one corner and used a bookshelf to block one of the windows so they weren't visible.  While at the event, I got a text from the landlord with a picture of the blocked window, captioned \"whatts this\"  What can I do to prevent my landlord from entering the apartment unannounced and to compel him to allow some form of curtain?

{"item": {"input": "CMV: The recent move by Dems to gerrymander blue states to a similar degree as their opposition is a net negative change for America To preface I am not a Dem but I have never voted for a Republican. I hate both parties but I hate one party significantly more. Here are my primary concerns. There are *individuals* in both parties that I agree with on certain policies (again, nearly all Dems and Independents) but that's about it.  1. Gerrymandering is bad for numerous reasons including unfairness and being anti-democratic. 2. This move entrenches the tactic in state and federal politics. Whereas previously at least Dems had motivation to eliminate partisan gerrymandering via legislation since they are now approximately equal beneficiaries (or will be if they keep it up) they will likely stop fighting to eliminate it. 3. This policy allows non-Dems to declare \u201cboth sides\u201d with validity on this issue (whereas previously it was not a valid argument as it was clear the GOP gerrymandered worse/more). 4. Overall, this represents a stalemate at state levels where now we have a set of deep red or deep blue states which will essentially be locked into their political affiliations permanently. This will increase corruption in those states as there will be no political recourse (the voters no longer matter).  I'm mostly open to changing my view on this in the direction of \"this isn't that bad\" because I feel like this is one of the final nails in the plurality voting democratic republic coffin.

You're arguing that the best system would be no gerrymandering at all.  And I would largely agree with you.  But given the way that Republicans have made nationally coordinated efforts to gerrymander over the last decade plus, and the benefits they have reaped from that, I don't see them voluntarily changing.  So if we're taking it as fait accompli that at least one party will be gerrymandering where they have the opportunity, then what are the possible outcomes?  Outcome #1 is that Republicans gerrymander and Democrats don't (or at the very least gerrymander to a lesser extent).  Outcome #2 is both parties gerrymander.  Which outcome is better?  In the former, there is less gerrymandering, but it likely results in a less fair map (e.g. see the 2012 House of Representatives Election, where Congressional Republicans won a majority of seats despite Democrats winning a majority of votes).  In the latter, there is more gerrymandering, but at least the negative effects of the process are working to balance themselves out to some effect.  I agree that a more fair system would be to prevent gerrymandering, but when gerrymandering is allowed unilateral disarmament is surefire way to allow groups who are willing to pursue such problematic tactics to gain power and further prevent change from happening."}}

What tips could you give to excel in the finer side of cooking?", "output": "Fine dining chef here. I've posted a few times before about the fundamental differences between restaurant cooking and home cooking and how a home cook can elevate their quality and execution.   * Learn proper technique- Jacques P\u00e9pin's New Complete Techniques is a great starting point. Its a progressive teaching tool with an emphasis on foundation techniques with lots of photos. Follow up with his is old KQED/PBS shows that are available on Youtube for free. For the advanced version, CIA's The Professional Chef will broaden horizons when it comes to product identification, breaking down proteins, and more advanced techniques.  * Learn the underlying principles of the science of food- Harold McGee's On Food & Cooking is the OG book that is on the shelf of every chef I know. If you're into video and lectures, Harvard's food science lecture series is on Youtube for free. The more you understand how food cooks, the easier it is to tackle more complex dishes.  * Start to develop intuitive cooking by eating a variety of cuisines and learning what goes with what. When culinary students ask me how to develop a better palate my advice is simply just eat as varied cuisines as you can afford. The Flavour Bible is also a great resource for what goes with what.  * Up your plating game by understanding plating concepts of colour, contrast, construction, and composition. This is a major difference with how home cooks approach a dish vs. a professional. r/culinaryplating is also a great place to learn.  * Some general tips and tricks learned when working in a fast paced kitchen.  * Sometimes quality tools count-  a good knife and learning how to take care of it is a game changer. r/chefknives has a great wiki and getting started guide. Good knife skills will make cooking go 90% faster. A consistent julienne is going to look better and cook more consistently than a pile of matchsticks of varying size.  * A lot of the time why a restaurant dish is superior is access to high quality, artisanal ingredients. Not essential to fine dining across the board but we're often working with a butcher who is custom aging steaks, day boat fish deliveries, etc. that are difficult for the home cook to access. You can still make a great dish using regular products with fundamentals and complexity that will get you closer to fine dining.  * Tackling more complex and heavy prep dishes found in fine dining will be aided by good habits-  mise en place and clean as you go. Organising your work environment is the key to being efficient with your labour and time in a kitchen. For example, when I am prepping, I have three bowls- 1] for uprepped product, 2] for scrap, 3] for finished prep. Think ahead, combine steps where you can. Clean as you go means get rid of scrap, re-use that bowl, wipe down, organise used tools, don't be a disaster child who has seventeen dirty spoons and flour everywhere once you put something in the oven and crack open a beer.   * Use recipes from known sources to improve your cooking. While videos can be helpful for understanding steps, cookbooks, while not always error free, have been tested and edited with a review process lacking in other sources. Pick a chef whose food is the style you are looking to work with and source one of their books. Many libraries have great line ups of cookbooks so you can rent before you own."}}

I am my PI's first student, and two other students have already quit on top of misuse of university funds. If I leave, my PI will likely have to wait another 2.5 years for a student to graduate and produce any papers. That's 6 years of being a tenure-track professor with no students graduated or publications or presentations from their work. My advisor is incredibly vulnerable. 3. I could switch advisors and go with a non-thesis track degree. This would likely forfeit any publications with my current advisor or our collaborators. My entire thesis is based on a collaboration with a government agency, and our partner at that agency is on my committee. That committee member has been incredibly supportive and understanding, but I doubt I could publish with just them with our data. This option would also still result in a major delay in my graduation. 4. I could quit altogether.  I am incredibly frustrated at the moment and thinking somewhat irrationally, but I feel like I am being abused.

{"item": {"input": "In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, I\u2019ve seen a lot about the differences in how a fetus is perceived by the Jewish faith tradition as opposed to Christianity. Where did this split come from, theologically? Perhaps just anecdotal evidence, but after the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe, I saw quite a few posts on social media about how the decision infringes on the religious liberties of Jews, since that faith tradition views a fetus as part of the mother and thus does not have the same ideological opposition to abortion as, say, evangelical Christians.   Leaving aside of validity of the political/legal argument, I\u2019m curious as the theological divide in perception. Where did this come from? Or am I way off base?", "output": "My answer will try to address the historical perception of a fetus, rather than the criminality of abortion, but there will be some overlap. To maintain neutrality, I'll use the more legal \"fetus/foeticide\" and \"natural person/homicide\". I'm also strictly examining historical interpretations of theology, not modern theology, or my own.  I'll mostly address changes in \"mainstream\" Jewish perception, because I'm not familiar enough with Christian apocrypha.  As a benchmark, by the 6th century, the Talmud(s) had been compiled to form the basis of Rabbinic Judaism. It is not a primary source, but explicitly stated that a fetus, whilst of great value, was not equivalent to the mother's life because it was \"part of the mother\" and not an individual, animate natural person. It distinguished between the \"moment of conception\" and the \"moment of determination\", that up until 40 days a fetus was \"like water\". It explicitly established a monetary fine as punishment for foeticide.  The Talmud includes a 3rd century source citing a 2nd century source (Rav Meir) saying that only once the fetus crowned, it was considered an \"animate being\" and its soul of equal value to the mother.  Question answered, right? Well no, the divergence may have occurred earlier.  The main theological issue stems from the interpretation of a specific passage from Exodus:  This passage only refers to miscarriage induced by a deliberate altercation. There are four *historical* points of contention here:  * The translation of the word *ason*, as harm/damage/calamity. * The interpretation of \"soul for soul, eye for eye\". * The interpretation of the victim of \"other damage\". * The influence of other scriptures on its overall interpretation.  From a literal perspective, there's a separation between foeticide and \"other damage\". But your question is on the theological perception of a fetus throughout history, not abortion.  The Babylonian Code of Hammurabi (c 1750 BCE) stated something similar, punishing foeticide with a fine, but the death of the mother as a capital crime. This was mirrored by other empires (except the Assyrians, who punished self-inflicted abortion with impalement). This doesn't tell us how they *perceived* a fetus, only that they considered killing a fetus different to killing a natural person.  This is where it gets complicated. The historicity of the Torah is a bit of a minefield: here's one AskHistorians thread, here's another. In addition, there's no clear consensus on when the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) canon became fixed. In case you're not Jewish, the Written Torah is only one part of Tanakh, and the Tanakh's interpretation is based on commentaries that vary throughout history (more on this later).  This complicates things further, because translations differ from each other. The Septuagint (Koine Greek translation of the Pentateuch, c. 3rd-2nd century BCE) and some targumim (Aramaic translations of oral works) were written to imply *ason* applied to the fetus, not the mother.  Why does this matter? **Because the Septuagint initially translated** ***ason*** **as form, not damage!** This leads to the translation: \"if \\[there is\\] full form, then you shall give life for life\" (\u1f10\u1f70\u03bd \u03b4\u1f72 **\u1f10\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u1f73\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd** \u1f26\u03bd, \u03b4\u1f7d\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u1f74\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u1f76 \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u1fc6\u03c2). Later Christian scholars corrected this to \"harm\".  Philo (1st century BCE) and Josephus (1st century CE), as I mention in a comment to another answer, made distinctions between killing an unformed/formed fetus and an infant. Philo relied on the Septuagint for his translations, and Philo and Josephus both follow the Septuagint's translation for this particular passage.  The influence of the Septuagint and Hellenistic Judaism is considerable - even though it differed from the original Hebrew (in some cases considerably) it was used by Jews who couldn't speak Hebrew during the Second Temple period, and by the earliest non-Jewish Christians. It isn't clear if its usage was universal amongst Hellenic Jews. Jews later discarded the Septuagint by the 2nd century CE for Hebrew or Aramaic scriptures. By the 4th century CE, the Septuagint contained inserted Christian apocrypha that weren't present in the original.  Both Philo and Josephus are representative of Judaeo-Hellenic and Judaeo-Roman syncretism - they wrote their texts as assimilated members of Greek and Roman society. Their interpretations therefore are not necessarily representative of mainstream interpretations of *Hebrew* texts at the time.  It is also why Philo, an Alexandrian Jew, considered abortion a capital crime, but Josephus who would have been raised under the Palestinian school, does not: the phrase \"soul for a soul, eye for an eye\" for example, is usually interpreted in Hebrew texts as a pecuniary punishment, rather than a literal one. This aligns with the idea that Philo - whose grasp of Hebrew was poor - considered abortion a capital crime (life for life), but Josephus did not.  Remember how the Torah is one part of the Tanakh? Well, the Tanakh is interpreted using the Oral Torah, which was transmitted orally until 70CE. The major compilations of the Oral Torah  weren't written down until \\~200CE, and weren't finalised until the 6th century. This makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact date of theological divergence. But there are clues.  The first clue is the concept that preserving life overrides all other commandments *except* homicide (and a few other things). The first explicit Talmudic reference to this cites Samuel of Nehardea (2nd-3rd century), but there are biblical references that predate it.  The other clues are sections of the Oral Torah with detailed explanations on the status of a fetus. In the Tractate Bekhorot, Rav Chisda (3-4th century) is cited as saying it takes 40 days for a fetus to form. The distinction between formed and unformed that Philo and Josephus made is no longer mentioned.  Another Talmudic source stated that before, a fetus is \"like water\". Likewise, a deceased fetus was said to not impart the same ritual impurity as a person's corpse.  The Mishnah Oholot (3rd century, but quoting a source from \\~150CE) allows surgical abortion to save the life of the mother up until crowning. Since homicide was not a permissible reason to save a person's life, a fetus could not have been considered a person.  Assuming (and it is an assumption) that the Mishnah Oholot is correctly citing a century-old source, that narrows it down to before the 2nd century. The question now is what happened before the Mishnah was written down?  Well, that goes back to the Septuagint's translation in the 3rd century BCE. Given the widespread use of the Septuagint, Hellenised Jews who didn't speak Hebrew were usually raised under the Alexandrian school and therefore used different texts to other Jews who followed the Palestinian school.  That's the origin of the divergence, which would have been codified in Christian theology given that non-Hebrew speaking Christians could only have read the Septuagint. I can't say if this divergence was universal within the Alexandrian school.  Regardless, by the final compilation of the Mishnah in the 3rd century and the rest of the Talmud in the 6th century, Rabbinic Judaism did not consider a fetus to be a fully-fledged \"animate being\", but part of the mother.  By the 11th century onwards, the word *ason* was considered to apply to the mother rather than the fetus. Later scholars from the 11th century onwards concretised this further by considering a fetus as \"not a person\", and then by considering a fetus to be an \"aggressor\" for endangering the life of the mother.  So there you have it. A word, translated differently in the 3rd century BCE, was the basis for the theological divide on the status of a fetus.  EDIT: Spelling. Corrections from mod remarks. Added Koine Greek."}}

In terms of general health conditions and healthcare, legal processes, life quality, and options available, people from the US often don't realize that 80% of the world is in a less- to much-less developed state and that just by being born in this country you're basically guaranteed a better life than most of the places on the planet.  Well I believe on the other hand that there is a sort of battle in the states by certain types of people (of all races and groups) to either be the biggest victim or to align themselves with them and deny the human experience of someone who is a part of what is seen as a privileged group. But the truth is, as I believe, that everyone in the country is part of a privileged group, the same way that a white homeless man is a part of a privileged race. _____  > *Hello, users of CMV!

The idea of \"intersectionality\" actually is useful here. Basically, it's a way to make sure you don't generalize about individuals and their level of privilege based on a single factor. Every individual has privileges and challenges and some groups face systematic discrimination.   Now, it's a hard fact that both homeless people and African-Americans face systemic discrimination. This doesn't mean that the white homeless guy is more or less privileged than the typical black person. In fact, intersectionality makes us recognize that two individuals' situations can't be compared based on their inclusion in one group. The \"intersectional\" view of the homeless man might look like this: on the side of privilege, he's a white man living in North America. However, he is currently homeless, has no credit, struggles with mental illness, and faced abuse in his childhood home.   Now let's imagine a black person who grew up in a stable two-parent household in the states. Again, there's some privilege here: but it doesn't cancel out or lessen the impact of any racial discrimination that this person might face.   I think you're correct that a lot of the rhetoric on both right and left is irresponsible. It can quickly become a race to the bottom with parties listing grievances that don't admit of direct comparison. Should we all, black and white, acknowledge the privilege we enjoy through being born in North America? Yes, absolutely. But this does not absolve us of taking a hard look at other areas where our society systematically discriminates: discrimination against women, people of colour, the poor, the mentally ill, the disabled, etc, etc.  Hope this helps; I think it's very valuable to recognize a group's grievances and claims rather than saying we don't have to recognize their complaints because they are privileged in other areas."}}

I'm not even mentioning the fact that these babies are nowhere near old enough to consent to a body mod. A small hole in their lobe is no big deal, yeah, but it's still their body. They should be able to make that decision for themselves. I think waiting even a couple of years is worth it.  Why I want my view changed: I just want to know what goes through a parents mind when they decide to risk their baby's health at such a young age all to conform to.. a weird gender norm? Because we don't put earrings on infant boys. In fact, some parents ban piercings for their sons even when they're older and request them.", "output": "\"Weird\" is relative. It's only weird in North America.  It's not a weird practice at all in South Asian countries and communities. In my culture, baby girls are adorned in all kinds of gold jewelry (necklaces, bangles, anklets, earrings) on their first birthday, so it's typical to get their ears pierced beforehand.  At the end of the day, piercing a baby's ears is purely for vanity purposes, but there is cultural significance to doing it in some areas of the world. In India alone, that's ~12.5% of the global population, so I guess it depends on how many people need to consider something \"not weird\" for you to consider it not weird."}}
{"item": {"input": "What type of silicone would be best for a masturbation cup? Porous vs Softness Hi, kinda of odd but I want to independently create a fleshlight type sex toy. I have a ton of questions, and those \u201cask an expert\u201d websites seem to be dead so here I am.   TLDR;;; looking to create or find a non porous, non toxic soft material for a fleshlight. I don\u2019t understand what makes up \u202asilicone and how to learn more.    OK so from the information I\u2019ve read, the less porous the material is the softer it is, but non porous means it can be cleaned properly/no bacteria growth.\u202c So obviously I\u2019m looking for a material that is low on the shore a hardness scale but is still non porous. Phthalate is apparently bad because that is the cause of chemical burns with sex toys, but this is what would make the silicone soft?   I don\u2019t know which compounds that make up silicone that influence porosity, softness, heat retention and elasticity, durability etc etc. How does the curing method effect the silicone? I don\u2019t understand what it is I need to create a silicone soft enough for a masturbator cup. Is \u201cmedical grade\u201d and \u201cfood grade\u201d silicones just that because the structure of them is less porous? Could the same type of silicone that breast implants use work - and how would I even know how to convey the exact type of silicone formula I want to a factory? I assume the harder silicon that holds the liquid of a breast implant could be used as a coat layer in a masturbation cup, over a softer silicone material that would be toxic with direct contact. What\u2019s the formula of breast implants silicone? How would I learn if it would would be durable enough to hold, and not deteriorate when constantly rubbed? How would a know how durable a type of rubber would be if thinly spread?  But then I see there\u2019s other options like TPE/TPR. It has a low durometer, and the lower the durometer the softer the material...how is this different from the shore scale? I read \u201cTPE is generally considered body safe\u201d - generally, so not always? How can I learn what kinds of silicone are \u201cmedical grade\u201d or are platinum cured and how do they differ? How would I be able to communicate this to a factory and check if it\u2019s \u201cgood quality\u201d?

{"item": {"input": "My dog suddenly during a routine procedure. Today my dog died.  &#x200B;  She was a 13(or so) old Pekingese. I took her in for her second round of vaccinations and to discuss potential dental cleaning as her breath was horrid.  &#x200B;  Backstory:  &#x200B;  I adopted her nearly 5 years ago. A dental expert estimated her age at about 5-7. She had horrid teeth. He removed 18 during a 2 hr surgery in Spring 2014. Even though I tried to brush them as best I could (she hated it) little by little tartar returned. In Nov 2016 she needed an emergency surgery for a bladder obstruction. Her bloodwork showed less than ideal liver numbers but she survived and had her teeth done again.  &#x200B;  Then in Nov 2017 I noticed her sleeping alot more. I noticed her eye was a little red. I took her for a senior check up and the doctor found a glaucoma. I tried treating it but she lost the eye in January 2018. Lost the second in March 2018. In February I had a eye puncture done to try and save her second eye but it failed so it was removed.  &#x200B;  With each of these surgeries I thought my dog was gonna die. The eye removals and bladder stones were emergencies and yet she lived.  &#x200B;  After her eyes were gone shr was unbothered. Lived her dog life. Didnt like walkig outside that much so I pushed her in a dog stroller. She was still eating etc. She was never \"active\" or playful. Just my dog.  &#x200B;  Jump to the present:  &#x200B;  Over the last few weeks Ive had a random (unexplained) anxiety about my dog dying. Like when I got home the first thing Id do was check that she was alive(?). She was 85% the same dog. But I did notice a few things:  &#x200B;  1. She was breathing more often through her mouth while asleep. She never did this but she is a smush faced dog so....  &#x200B;  2. She was panting indoors randomly. I attributed it to overheating (due to her long coat during summer) but it ws rare so I thought nothing much of it.  &#x200B;  2. She had a period of incontinence. She was peeing in her sleep and while standing (without squatting) without realizing it. And this is a dog who HATES her own urine. The vet did a bladder check and it was clear. Then for the next 6 weeks the incontinence stopped and she started getting up to use her in house pee pads again.  &#x200B;  3. About 4 weeks ago she started eating less. Usually she eats twice a day. But she was always picky (and blind) so I figured she was just not aware of the time. I bought her some cheaper (more fragrant) dog food and mixed it with water. She ate more at first. But then started eating once a day. Then eating 90% of the food a coming back for the rest hours later. 3 weeks ago she hadnt eating for like 36 hrs so I was worried. So I gave her some plain yogurt with low fat and water mixed in. She ate it. This is when I thought her teeth might be the reason. But again she simple returned to eating semi regularly. Though her love of table food waned. (Attributed to a sore mouth).  &#x200B;  Jump to today:  &#x200B;  I took her to the vet this morning. Discussed her teeth with the vet. I wanted to know the state of her mouth. And asked if it would be better to remove her leftover 22 teeth rather than putting her under again next year when she was even older.  &#x200B;  He said he needed an xray and inspection of the mouth. To get that he would have to put her under for a short time and he would need bloodwork and a heart and lung xray.  &#x200B;  So I agreed.  &#x200B;  Bloodwork came out mostly normal. Her inflammation numbers were up. But slightly above average.(likely cause of her mouth). Her anemic levels were low (slightly below average). All her number were normal or in 1-3 points of normal.  &#x200B;  This vet went through the same process for each surgery and was confident it was fine to proceed and I agreed. I handed over my dog and waited outside.  &#x200B;  Time passed. Other people were waiting. Both vets were in the OR with my dog. I could hear a machine beeping. But I remained calm because Ive heard that sound in surgeries before. 35 mins passed. I was getting a little worried. But figured they were working on another dog and mine was up next or got delayed and procedure started much later after they took her back.  &#x200B;  Then they called me in the exam room. I swear I was about to get my dog handed to me. And they asked me to come to the back.  &#x200B;  She was lying there with tubes in her mouth. Dead.  &#x200B;  They explained this:  &#x200B;  They administered a low level of propofol and when the medicine was pushed her lungs simply stopped pumping. They said this can happen in certain situations for a few seconds with dogs but the lungs will restart pumping. Hers didnt. So they pushed medicine to reactivate the heart. But it didnt work. So they tried for like 25 minutes to revive her and failed. She passed away and they never even got to the xray and exam.  &#x200B;  What the fuck?!?  &#x200B;  I couldnt believe it. She was old. But she her major organs were all in good health. She wasnt allergic to it as all her last procedures used the exact same medicine and in higher doses for a longer time.  &#x200B;  But this time it killed her. And I cant figure out why. They explained that this happened very rarely. And online research says the same. They are a busy vet and said this happens to them once a year but rarely twice.  &#x200B;  But what I cant find is an explaination. Why would a low dose of propofol cause lungs to simply stop? The only explaination I find online are all \"veterinary negligence\" which is possible. But in the years I went there when I heard  OR machines going both vets were always back there, the same as this time. Assuming it wasnt negligence on their part,  what could have caused it? Shock? I literally can find anything on it. Like no one studies the \"unknown\" anesthetic deaths or something but that cant be true.  &#x200B;  The more I think about it the more I feel like my dog was showing yellow flags that she was in a cognitive decline. Maybe she wasnt going to die right away, but she was slowly on her way. And this procedure at this moment pushed her over the edge and she died. And whatever caused it wasnt picked up by bloodwork tests or x rays.  &#x200B;  The vets arent bad people. Its possible they fucked up. But they seemed to be in just as much shock as I was. Because theyve done this hundreds of times before and this is the first sudden death in a while. They even paid for her funeral and cremation.  &#x200B;  I always figured she would get some acute disease like kidney failure and I would have time to  process her impending death and hold her while I put her down. She died at around 11:45 this morning. Thry told me at 12:13pm. I brought her ashes home at 3:00pm. And now her urn is sitting on a shelf in front of me.  &#x200B;  I had a dog exactly 12 hours ago.

In order to limit marginal profits, you\u2019d have to implement some sort of price cap.  This issue with price ceilings are pretty well known in microeconomics - and said issue makes it especially bad when we\u2019re talking about medical care. Basically, a price ceiling would result in a market disequilibrium in the form of a shortage. Supply would decrease along the supply curve, and demand would increase along the demand curve. Demand would be greater than supply, resulting in a shortage.  This shortage is especially bad when we consider medical treatment. Resting, diagnoses, medication, specific therapies - these things can be incredibly expensive. The people hit the worst in a shortage would probably be those who have more severe conditions that require the most care.  Instead, the idea of universal healthcare would account for hospital funding. Instead of private insurance companies paying for costly procedures, the government would. The average person probably would not end up paying more in taxes than they would have paid towards private insurance as well."}}

If you\u2019re looking at something like beer batter then the purpose is the carbonation so you could use carbonated water to fit the bill.  If it\u2019s to be used for a braise or the base of the sauce it\u2019s probably there for flavour and depth so I would just just a good stock or even water if there are plenty of other flavourful ingredients.   The other way thing it does is to tenderise meat. There a few non-alcoholic things you can use to do this. Pineapple is a good one though does have a very different profile to most beers. I\u2019ve heard baking soda can be used but admittedly I\u2019ve never tried it myself.  Cider is a little easier as I find apple juice works as a very decent alternative (just don\u2019t get one that\u2019s too sweet).   In short there\u2019s loads of alternatives but the thing to start with is to work out why it\u2019s there in the first place.

But today, an A is the most common grade given in college; the percentage of A grades has tripled, to 45 percent nationwide. Seventy-five percent of all grades awarded now are either A\u2019s and B\u2019s.

I thought this was a really good system, because it both helped normalize grades between different TA's and helped avoid giving students taking labs off-sequence an advantage by only being compared with students who'd already failed the lab once or more.  There were other problems with rich kids' parents complaining to the lab coordinator rarely (Yay California!) but for the most part this didn't help people.

Say the robbers stopped for gas and payed with some of the marked money.

{"item": {"input": "Do you live comfortably as a professor in a big city? Hi all! As in the title, I am curious if it is possible to live comfortably as a professor in a big city, i.e. say one with a 500k+ population. By 'comfortably', I roughly mean being able to buy a (small) house, not be frugal on groceries, eat out 1-2 times a week, and travel 1-2 times a year (domestically). I know an Econ Phd student who has just accepted an assistant professor position with 110K a year in Boston and he said he is really worried about living there with such a salary (maybe this is a 9-month salary). From my search, I also know a few math/stats professors from the Bay area earning around 90-95K, which I believe is not very high given the crazy cost of living there.   I know this is a very complicated question since it depends a lot on the specific city, field, institution type (private/public, R1/R2, teaching, etc.), and also the spouse, so I guess I just want to know some perspectives. I am in math/stats if you are curious. In general, I want to see if one can live comfortably as a professor or not, so even if you are not living in a big city, you can also share your stories (I guess expensive college towns like Santa Barbara can be interesting case studies).  Thank you so much.", "output": "Many people who work don't buy houses in large cities. So if owning your house is a requirement for comfort then many profs in places like NYC (or London, Paris, etc) do not live 'comfortably'. But your other requirements like \"not be frugal on groceries, eat out 1-2 times a week, and travel 1-2 times a year (domestically)\" are usually satisfied with an assistant professor's salary in a big city. That you think these latter requirements are on par with 'owning a house' seems a bit strange to me -- at least if you've lived in big cities before."}}

This is the place to apply for a flair \u2013 the colored text you will have seen next to some user's names indicating their specialization. We are always looking for new flaired users, and if you think you have what it takes to join the panel of historians, you're in the right place!  For examples of previous applications, and our current panel of historians, you can find the previous application thread here, and there is a list of active flaired users](/r/AskHistorians/wiki/flairedusers) on our wiki.  **[Requirements for a flair**  A flair in /r/AskHistorians indicates extensive, in-depth knowledge about an area of history *and* a proven track record of providing great answers in the subreddit. In applying for a flair, you are claiming to have:  * **Expertise in an area of history**, typically from either degree-level academic experience or an equivalent amount of self-study. For more exploration of this, check out this thread.  * The ability to **cite sources** from specialist literature for any claims you make within your area.  * The ability to provide **high quality answers** in the subreddit in accordance with our rules.    For a more in-depth look at how applications are analyzed, consult this helpful guide on our wiki explaining what an answer that demonstrates the above looks like.  **How to apply**  To apply for a flair, simply post in this thread. Your post needs to include:  * Links to **3-5 comments** in /r/AskHistorians that show you meet the above requirements, and of which at least three were posted in the last six months. Answers linked in an application should go 'above and beyond' the base requirements of the rules here, and reflect the depth of your expertise.  * The **text of your flair** and which category it belongs in (see the sidebar). Be as specific as possible as we prefer flair to reflect the exact area of your expertise as near as possible, but be aware there is a limit of 64 characters.  One of the moderators will then either confirm your flair or, if the application doesn't adequately show you meet the requirements, explain what's missing. If you get rejected, don't despair! We're happy to give you advice and pointers on how to improve your portfolio for a future application. Plenty of panelists weren't approved the first time.  If there's a backlog this may take a few days but we will try to get around to everyone as quickly as possible.  **\"I'm an Expert About Something But Never Have a Chance to Write About It!\"**  Some topics only come up once in a blue moon, but that doesn't mean you can't still get flair in it! There are a number of avenues to follow, many of which are dealt with in greater detail at the last section of this thread.  **Expected Behavior**  We invest a large amount of trust in the flaired members of /r/askhistorians, as they represent the subreddit when answering questions, participating in AMAs, and even in their participation across reddit as a whole. As such, we do take into account an applicant's user history reddit-wide when reviewing an application, and will reject applicants whose post history demonstrate bigotry, racism, or sexism. Such behavior is not tolerated in /r/askhistorians, and we do not tolerate it from our panelists in any capacity. We additionally reserve the right to revoke flair based on evidence of such behavior after the application process has been completed. /r/AskHistorians is a safe space for everyone, and those attitudes have no place here.  **Quality Contributors**  If you see an unflaired user consistently giving excellent answers, they can be nominated for a \"Quality Contributor\" flair. Just message the mods their username and some example comments which you believe meet the above criteria.  **FAQ Finder**   To apply for FAQ finder, we require demonstration of a consistent history of community involvement and linking to previous responses and the FAQ. We expect to see potential FAQ Finders be discerning in what they link to, ensuring that it is to threads which represent the current standards of the subreddit, and they do so in a polite and courteous manner, both to the 'Asker', and also by including a username ping of the original 'Answerer'.  **Revoking Flair**  Having a flair brings with it a greater expectation to abide by the subreddit's rules and maintain the high standard of discussion we all like to see here. The mods will revoke the flair of anybody who continually breaks the rules, fails to meet the standard for answers in their area of expertise, or violates the above mentioned expectations. Happily, we almost never have to do this.  **Additional Resources**  Before applying for flair, we encourage you to check out these resources to help you with the application process:  * Our Rules Roundtable on what a 'Good Answer' looks like * Our Wiki Guide on what makes a good application * The Previous Application Threads, to see what makes for successful - and not successful - applications.  * The Sunday Digest, and Monthly Awards which can provide many examples of we are looking for regarding the caliber of flaired users.", "output": "Here\u2019s my flair suggestion: Holy Roman Empire, Brandenburg, Diplomatic History  Here are my comment proofs (sourced the main question):  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ke6w0g/according_to_wikipedia_apparently_the_title_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/klxdti/why_were_interregna_on_the_holy_roman_empire_so/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/kid3fa/does_anyone_still_identify_as_prussian_within_or/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/j2khgy/did_the_thirty_years_war_make_todays_eastern/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/j1j3e1/help_with_grad_school_advice/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/i7z7ns/if_the_peace_of_westphalia_established_a_new_way/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf"}}

This book is genuinely very well-written and even emotionally moving.  \"Faraday, Maxwell, and the Electromagnetic Field\" by Nancy Forbes is almost precisely the same kind of book as Quantum Labyrinth for 19th century physics. Joint biography of Faraday and Maxwell as well as the overall history of the study of electromagnetism.  \"The Man Who Stalked Einstein\" about Philip Lenard and the anti-Einstein Nazi scientist movement.

{"item": {"input": "[Star Wars] Why is everybody ok with droid slavery? Unfortunately this is a somewhat contentious topic, but lets try and keep things civil and within sub rules.  1) So, through Star Wars, most of the main characters are opposed to slavery of organics, and many galactic governments (try to) prohibit it. Some characters make efforts to free slaves when they find them.   2) Some robots are clearly sentient/salient/people, with intelligence, emotions and capabilities equal to those of organics. Despite this, droids are not seen as people and are freely traded and owned as property even under governments that ban slavery.  3) these two facts seem to be in conflict with eachother. Why do Jedi who are willing to risk their lives to save organic slaves not bat an eye about droid slavery?", "output": "\"Some robots are clearly sentient/salient/people, with intelligence, emotions and capabilities equal to those of organics.\"   Here's the thing with Star Wars, droids aren't sentient. Obi Wan states in episode 2 that \"If droids could think, they'd be none of us here.\" R2-D2 is the only droid that shows signs of sentience. I think it's in the same film, C-3PO states something along the lines of \"For a droid you seem to do an awful lot of thinking\" This is in reference to R2-D2 wanting to follow Anakin and Padme on Geonosis.

So rather than focusing so much on figuring things out, I think of processing more like riding the wave of the emotion. I do that by naming it and noticing the sensations that come along with it (for ex: I feel tense and there's a ball of energy in my chest. I think I'm anxious). Then I check in with my body to see if there's anything I need (food, water, sleep, social connection, movement).

I feel that the preference in our tax system for capital gains instead of ordinary income is an unfair susbidy towards the rich, who earn the majority of the capital gains.  I would be ok with only taxing real capital gains (meaning over and above inflation, so if you buy a stock at $100 and sell one year later at $103 and inflation was 3%, you would not have any gain to pay taxes on).  I've seen arguments that treating capital gains differently from earned income encourages investment, but I don't see the need to subsidize investing in the stock market over working or any other thing people choose to do with their money.  Furthermore, treating capital gains differently from income encourages the rich to try to classify their income as capital gains (see carried interest for hedge fund managers).     _____  > *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

What I want to change your view on is that it \u201cunfair\u201d. So a few points here to maybe consider:   1) A lot of this has to do with the fact that most middle class people will try to \u201cflip\u201d their investments too quickly, and end up getting taxed for a short term investment (with is taxed at the ordinary income tax rate). While larger companies or \u201cricher\u201d people have longer term investments that actually take advantage of the capital gains tax. It\u2019s not unfair, it\u2019s just that normal people either get bad advice or are ignorant to the tax code.   2) We already have a progressive tax rate for the capital gains rate based on your income. So richer people actually pay a higher capital gains tax anyway compared to their more modest counterparts.   *\u201dI would be ok with only taxing real capital gains (meaning over and above inflation, so if you buy a stock at $100 and sell one year later at $103 and inflation was 3%, you would not have any gain to pay taxes on). \u201c*  If you did this, you would effectively be taking away a lot of incentive to invest. This actually helps businesses because sometimes their projected return on investment isn\u2019t high enough to get investors to buy in. So the tax incentive sweetens the deal for investors, which ends up being good for everyone.   *\u201dI've seen arguments that treating capital gains differently from earned income encourages investment, but I don't see the need to subsidize investing in the stock market over working or any other thing people choose to do with their money.\u201d*   I really hope you can consider this a bit more. while these people do benefit from the capital gains tax at a higher overall amount, the benefit that comes from promoting investing actually helps out us normal folk a lot more than if we just taxed their income that they hide in some foreign country anyway. When they invest it does create jobs, there\u2019s a direct correlation between the two.   *\u201dFurthermore, treating capital gains differently from income encourages the rich to try to classify their income as capital gains (see carried interest for hedge fund managers).\u201d*  Well yes they do take advantage of the tax break but that\u2019s the incentive to get them to invest instead of just jumping into a sea of gold coins like Scuge McDuck and saying fuck the rest of us lol. It helps things run a bit more smoothly when the rich will just invest instead of trying to collect their taxes and disperse the love. If we can give them incentive to do it then it\u2019s a good idea, it won\u2019t stop them from being rich if we get rid of the incentive to invest.

The system works in at least two distinctly different ways:   1. some charters heavily market their product to poor minority students, luring them (and the federal and state money allotted them) away from traditional public schools to schools where the teachers have a significantly smaller total compensation package than their public school counterparts.   2. other charters cater to high-achieving students and lure them (and the money) from their public schools to schools where they can focus on their studies away from the bother of students who can\u2019t achieve because they don\u2019t live in a safe and stable home, don\u2019t have access to technology, don\u2019t have invested parents, don\u2019t have food, etc.   These students would be high achievers wherever they went to school.

Thank you!", "output": "Good sear = lots of smoke  That recipe will produce even more since the pan stays hot after you put it back in the oven, so it keeps smoking.  You can minimize it with the reverse sear that will work fine with your tools. First, bake the steak at 250 F until the inside is just cooked to how you like it (use a thermometer). Use a baking sheet or whatever. Then, put your aluminum skillet (not nonstick!) on your hottest burner and heat it up until it passes the water bead test.  Keeping the heat on high, drop in the steak (shake off any juices first). Cook 30 seconds to a minute on each side until well seared. Move back onto baking sheet. No need to rest since it was baked slowly.  This will still make a bunch of smoke getting that nice crust, but much less since it's exposed to high heat for a much shorter time. And it works with thick steaks without overcooking the outside (for a huge steak, go closer to 200 F)."}}

This also leads to my opinion on tipping and that it should never be expected, but they should still be allowed to be accepted if offered.  It seems like the \"tipped employee\" wage difference is somewhat exploitative in favor of the employer, even though the employer would be required to compensate the difference if the employee did not earn at least the minimum wage in tips.  In some cases, customers return to a specific restaurant with service received having an influence on that decision.

{"item": {"input": "CMV: Dating and finding a relationship is easier for the average woman compared to the average man Now, this isn't a post to bash women or how dating is easy for women. It's about how when you compare the experience of the average woman compared to the average man, it's easier for the woman to find dates and a relationship.  Let's start with an example from my personal life. Last year some friend of mine broke up. So far the woman has gone on multiple dates with three different dudes one after the other. Essentially when she decides that she doesn't like one guy she just moves on to the next one in less than a week. While my male friend hasn't had a single date so far and that's not due to a lack of trying. Now even though at the end of the day they are both still single, the women at least go on dates which mean she has a higher chance to find someone compared to the man who hasn't been on a single date.  This brings me to my first point. The average woman has a lot more options compared to the average man. I remember reading a survey that said that on average women are asked about 12 times a year compared to asking less than 1 guy out. And when we introduce online dating it gets even worse. On average a woman has a match rate of 30% while a man has 0.013%. This means that statistically, women have a lot more opportunities to meet the one compared to a man. More options are better than fewer options.  My second point comes down to the average dating strategy. The average woman is a lot more passive than a man, in the man is still the one doing the asking out and trying to impress the woman. This means that women have the option to just passively exist and they just pick and choose from their options. In addition to that, they always have the option of becoming proactive and going after the guys they want if they don't like their options. Compared that to the average guy whose only option is to actively go out looking for women and initiating stuff, since if he just stayed and waited for women to approach he will remain single.  And finally, there is the problem that till about the age of 54 there are just more men than women.", "output": "Counterargument (from a man): women pay for the relative ease of access with a much higher level of personal danger.

Consequently, it's much more likely that your average undergraduate will be exposed to Foucault or Bourdieu rather than Kripke or Parfit. This is, of course, a broad generalization and authors like Rawls and Kuhn are some of the most highly cited writers in the humanities and social sciences. But it seems, broadly, that one is more likely to be exposed to continental thought in higher education, resulting in a lot of quasi-academic material targeted towards laypeople (books, podcasts, video essays). For example, Zizek has two documentaries explaining many concepts in psychoanalysis and marxism through sardonic, ironic, and self-aware parody of popular culture. Bryan Magee's televised interviews from the 1970s focuses primarily on the analytic tradition or on the opinion of analytic philosophers; however, their conversations are much more rigid and typically academic. Surely still approachable to a lay audience, but less immediately attention grabbing than Zizek parodying Full Metal Jacket to explain Lacan and Althusser.   Also, to reiterate an already made point, analytics mostly publish journal articles. Unless one has institutional access or is aware of alternative methods of bypassing paywalls, it's much more likely that they will walk into a bookstore and see Foucault,  Heidegger, or Sartre on the shelf."}}

My boss decided that, even though I'm not on this project and didn't make this part (he did), I should be the one to make the revisions.

I'm a 25 year old male (150 lbs, 6') that has had some serious pain in my feet for the last 8 months that's slowly spreading throughout my other joints. I'll do my best to outline the events and time line below:  **May 2022** \\- I woke up one morning and my second toe (next to the big toe) on my right foot was noticeably swollen with mild pain. I hadn't had any injuries or activities that would have caused this but I didn't think much of it.   **June 2022** \\- After a month of swelling, the pain slowly got worse, to the point that it was painful to walk. I went to a pediatrist and he thought it was a torn ligament in that toe. He put me on steroids for a week and saw me again. No improvement was made so he put me on another dose of the same steroid. Just like the first, nothing happened. After the meds, he decided to put me into a boot for a month.   **August 2022** \\- After a month of wearing the boot, I didn't see any improvement and noticed that the swelling was starting to spread to other toes on my right foot. This started to get me worried so I went to another pediatrist who said that it was definitely not a torn ligament. His guess was that it was gout. He did a uric acid blood test, which came back negative but still decided to put me on alopurinol for a few weeks to see if it did anything. After I finished the meds, no improvement had been made and the pain and swelling was getting worse.   **September 2022** \\- By this point I was getting desperate and started to look other places to see if it was caused by something else. I went to an internal medicine doctor that did a full blood panel to see if any of my levels were off. The panel came back completely nonreal, even noting that once again the uric acid levels were normal. He didn't have any suggestions as to what could be causing the foot pain and swelling. By this point, the swelling had spread to all the toes on the right foot and the pain was very prominent around the joint of the big toe and the bottom side of all the toes in the metatarsal area.   **October 2022** \\- By this point, I was starting to have swelling on my big toe on the left foot and was getting sharp pain in my right hip area, deep within the glute, that was making it really difficult to move around. I went to go see an orthopedic surgeon to see if he had any ideas as to what this would be. He said that he had never seen anything like this, and even brought his colleague in to see if they had any ideas. They were both stumped and told me to try stem cell treatment that wasn't covered by insurance. I didn't want to jump into that without getting an actual diagnosis so I wasn't throwing away money.   **December 2022** \\- By this point I'm completly at my wits end trying to figure out what this is and not having any doctors know what it is. The swelling has gotten really bad in the right foot, causing dark colors around all the joints of the toes, especially in the mornings. My right knee has also started to get swollen and has similar pain to the toes, especially when the knee is straightened.  My next step is to see a rheumatologist but they are booked out until February. I'm hoping that one of you have an idea that could help me out.   TLDR: Woke up one morning with a swollen and painful toe. The swelling has spread to all the toes on the right foot and has been extremely painful.

{"item": {"input": "CMV: Liberals should abandon identity politics and instead focus on class/economic issues Identity Politics (IP) is largely unhelpful and extremely divisive. The focus on identity by liberals alienates other people on the left and creates huge distance from those in the middle and those on the right. Class/economic issues, such as wealth inequality and ending crony capitalism, are far more unifying messages for those who hold liberal ideology. Alleviating class/economic issues would also have downstream positive impact on many other issues (often championed by IP) such as racial inequality.  Proponents of IP get caught up too often in the characteristics of the individuals making political arguments \u2013 practically by design. The speaker therefore is weighted according to inherent traits they happened to be born with (race, gender, sexual orientation). This creates an environment in which large portions of the population/electorate (i.e. straight, white, male) feel that their opinions and issues are valued less than others. The resulting atmosphere, exacerbated deliberately by right leaning talking points, causes many to abandon the left.  Class/economic issues should become the leading message for liberals, given the broader appeal it would naturally have. Discussing and championing issues of income distribution/poverty/corruption would reach a much larger population and could pull many in the middle and on the right back toward the left. This would not only be practically useful for political reasons, but would also have a net positive impact on many of the class-related social issues that we see in society.     _____  > *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

There are certain events that involve speedsters that have to happen, or a major paradox would occur. These fixed points in time are somehow preserved by the speed force unless something happens that renders these events irrelevant, and the speedster involved is maintained as a time remnant. For example, when Eddie Thawne was killed, the mainline Eobard was killed, but the speed force saved a time remnant of Eobard, possibly from another timeline, in order to kill Barry's mom, since that event is a fixed point in time. It's not clear how these remnants are actually generated, possibly they just pop into existence in the speed force from another timeline.   As for what this means for Eobard's ability to be hurt, if Eobard A is fighting you, and Eobard B is a \"future\" version that does something important to the timeline, then you can still harm Eobard A, even kill him, but then a remnant of Eobard B will exist for the purposes of preventing any further paradoxes.   Which leads to a final point, does this mean that a version of Eobard Thawne must always exist? I'm fairly sure that point has been brought up before by Thawn as a yes.

One of the things that you'll see is that part of communicating with another device can involve a negotiation phase where the two devices communicate on the lowest common denominator to try and figure out what capabilities both devices have.  Once that's handled everything else can shift up to something more appropriate.  Stark has been messing around with AI and other advanced programming ideas for a while now.  If you jammed an AI into the negotiation phase of your communication protocol, then you could get away with all sorts of crazy ideas.  Like, each radio can start off shouting prime numbers into the void and then end up co-inventing a custom protocol just so that the people talking to each other can exchange a few words about lunch.  Stark has also had a long time to think about this.  He first gets introduced to aliens in Avengers 1, which means he would be thinking about how would you open comms with an alien species that you have never met.  Additionally, alien species would have already been thinking about this problem for centuries.  Everyone in the universe keeps on bumping into new and interesting people they've never met before.

Let's also vomit some PI out into the void and then switch it up with digits of e.  That should get its attention.  Step 5:  Start sending over a computational framework.  Lambda calculus, SK combinators, turing machines.  Really whatever floats your boat.  Keep an eye out for the other AI doing the same thing.  At first just show an example program with an input and the expected output.  But by the end we'll be sending over complex programs with complex inputs and expecting the other AI to send back the correct answer.    Step 6:  Okay, we can send each other programs now and have a reasonable expectation that the other side can execute it.  So, send over the program for decoding the beautiful digital data into the disgusting meat sack skin flap noise using a speaker.    Step 7:  Initiate some sort of game with the other AI.

{"item": {"input": "Involved in a multi car accident with fatalities. I want to help all I can but I also want to protect myself. California  Just a warning this is extremely graphic.  Over the weekend, my boyfriend, our friend, and I went on a trip to the coast. We were driving back to Sacramento early in the morning when there was an accident. We were driving through a rural area on a highway, going 65, and it was pitch black. From what I could tell in the dark and at my distance, and with the speed in which things were happening, it looked like two cars collided and debris was all over the road. I braked hard and went to avoid the cars but hit some debris so I pulled over.   When I got out to check my vehicle, I ran back to the scene to see what I hit and discovered a body in the far right lane. I went on auto pilot and called 911. I did my best to explain where we were and what happened. There was another body on the ground a couple lanes away from the first, and a girl screaming and pinned under a car. I stayed with her while bystanders and my passengers did their best to make the scene safer by redirecting traffic.  When police arrived we got together with them and lifted the car off the girl. She had a severe head injury. I stayed with her until the paramedics arrived which was also about when she stopped breathing. I have no idea if she made it, or what her quality of life will be if she did.  After the paramedics took over I broke down and walked back to my car. I cried heavily for a couple of minutes. An officer approached me and my passengers and took our statements. I told them I think I hit someone and they tried to convince me I only hit debris. I was not convinced, and leaned under my car with my phone flash light on and found blood and bits of...flesh or brain, smeared all over my car's belly and hanging down from the heat shields and exhaust system. I was angry with the officer for blowing me off and trying to get us to leave. I had a literal crime scene under my f\\*cking car.  Eventually they decided there were three separate incidents. An officer gave me a card with his badge number and the incident number. He took my insurance information and took pictures of my vehicle, but only took one picture of my vehicle's underside from the front. Remember this was pitch black rural territory with no streetlights. Then he told us that they had everything they needed, that we could go, and to just take my car to a car wash and rinse it off really good, which is absolutely mortifying imo but what else are you supposed to do??  I'm asking if there is anything else I can do. It the daylight you can see better just how much human remains are smeared and hanging off my undercarriage. I doubt the evidence that was collected and I had the thought to have a local CHP officer come out and take additional photos and send them to the officers who responded (we drove straight home from there after that, skipping Sacramento altogether. I don't feel comfortable stating where I live here but I do live in California). I haven't washed my car yet and I would like to do so as soon as possible...I need to get rid of that smell, and I need to have my transmission looked at because it doesn't sound good after what happened.  I just don't know if this could be used against me. I feel like not because of the way the officers were treating the situation, trying to convince me I didn't hit a literal human and trying to get me to leave. Barely taking pictures and all. But I don't know. I just don't know. I'm sorry if I'm asking stupid questions I just want to do everything I possibly and reasonably can. I didn't see what I hit, and if I did, avoiding it could have put myself and my passengers at further risk. The incident was spread across the highway taking up all three lanes and even the shoulders on either side. I just didn't want to collide with the vehicles in the wreckage.  I also want to find out, if legally possible, if there were survivors. One paramedic said the two bodies were gone, but was vague about the girl. I've spoken with my friends, some of whom are medical professionals, about the injury she sustained and the potential for her survival, and no one seems to think that with a head injury like that than anyone could live and if they could, their quality of life wouldn't be great. An article I found online describing the incident states there was one fatality and two taken to the hospital with major injuries, which obviously conflicts with what the paramedic told me. I also want to know if my impact with that passenger killed him, because the article (if it's accurate, who knows) states that the only person who died was the one my vehicle collided with and if the other two people initially survived their ejection, I have reason to believe the man I hit was also alive.  So would it be in my best interest to just rinse off my car and move on with my life, and not try to get more information to the officers? Do they need more information? I feel awful and selfish for asking such a question, but my heart goes out to those people and I want to do everything I can. But I also don't want to have the family members come after me. There's nothing I could have done differently that would have been safer or better. And no amount of evidence or whatever is going to bring that man back to life. Either way, whether he was dead or alive before I hit him, nothing is going to bring him back to life. And I have to live with that.  Also, how can I legally and respectfully find out if the other two people survived? Would it be a bad idea to tell the officers to give my phone number to the family members? I don't know what I would tell them...I don't know. I just don't know how to proceed and I don't want to do something to make things worse.  Thank you for your advice and I'm sorry if I'm asking stupid selfish questions or being insensitive I don't mean to be I just really need to know.

I suggest contacting your liability insurance prior to doing anything with your car, including washing it, and see if they want photographs with the remains intact. I would not contact the police with regards to this matter as, frankly, it isn't going to help you at all and it isn't going to either help or hurt the investigation into the at-fault driver.   Because this matter involves at least one fatality, there is a strong possibility that you will be pulled into litigation of this matter, primarily because there is likely limited insurance coverage to compensate for the damages to all three injured parties by the at-fault driver's insurance. Your insurance company should provide you an attorney to represent you with regards to that matter. If you are contacted by any other insurance company, decline to make a recorded statement. You will likely be required to make one for your own insurance. If you are contacted by the police, I would recommend consulting with a criminal attorney before speaking to them further.   As far as finding out what happened to the victims, that may be a can of worms you don't want to open. If this occurred in a rural area, the local newspaper will likely have a follow-up story regarding whether there were any additional fatalities (rural areas tend to have a slow news cycle). However, I would really consider whether or not you want to know the disposition of these people prior to searching.

Often times flavour comes from time, either for caramelisation (think of French Onion soup... ingredients are literally butter, onion, beef stock, bread and cheese, but it cooks over hours and transforms into something completely different) or from reduction and allowing the flavours to meld together (amatriciana for example). Or it may just be as simple as letting quality ingredients do the talking (Margherita pizza).   Good quality over quantity when it comes to ingredients and you can\u2019t go wrong."}}

Today I\u2019ve had no appetite and last time I ate was around 7:30pm yesterday. 20mins ago I got up to use the toilet and as I was making my way out, I collapsed.

{"item": {"input": "How does travelling at or close to the speed of light slow down the rate at which your body decays (age), compared to someone that is stationary? Is this actually the case or is it that the person going at or near the speed of light is not moving through \"time\" at the same rate?  If the latter is true, why and how does this occur?", "output": ">Is this actually the case ...If the latter is true  What you're asking about is time dilation in special relativity, and it's very real. And it doesn't even have to be close to the speed of light to be measurable. Time dilation is always present between any two frames of reference that have some velocity relative to each-other. The effect is just much smaller at slower speeds. Time dilation was experimentally confirmed using atomic clocks on jet airplanes as early as the 1970s, and the atomic clocks in GPS satellites need to be adjusted to account for both the fact that they are moving very fast (special relativity) and that they are experiencing a smaller gravitational pull than is present at the surface of the Earth (general relativity).   -  > how does this occur?   This occurs as a consequence of two facts:  1. The speed of light in vacuum is always measured to be the same speed, regardless of how fast the light source is moving relative to the observer. 2. The Pythagorean theorem.   Wikipedia has a good explanation of how to derive this with a thought experiment involving light on a moving train. Here's a video of someone writing out the same derivation.  -   >Is this actually the case or is it that the person going at or near the speed of light is not moving through \"time\" at the same rate?  I'm not really sure what you mean by \"moving through time,\" so I'll sort of explain some things around that.   The first thing to understand about time dilation is that, no matter what, an observer will never notice anything funny about their own time. They don't see *themselves* as being in slow motion. It's only *other reference frames* that are moving with some velocity relative to them that they observe time moving more slowly.   Second, it's not just their body that's effected, as your post title implies. *Everything* is effected by time dilation. Any kind of \"clock\" you can imagine, including the half-life of radioactive particles, appears slower in a reference frame that's moving with respect to yours.   Third, (as some other comments here have mentioned) it's not that time is moving slowly for one observer but not the other. *Both observers* perceive the other's clocks as running more slowly than their own. It's only when one observer decelerates, turns around, accelerates, and decelerates again to meet back up with the first observer that they find one of them has aged more than the other. The actual twin paradox is understanding why that is, not just the existence of time dilation.  -  If you're interested in learning more, MinutePhysics has a series on relativity."}}

{"item": {"input": "CMV: The diversity added into Amazon's Wheel of Time series added nothing, and was a net loss for the show. I want to start by saying that I'm a full hearted supporter of adding diversity into screen adaptations of stories from other media. I consider diversity to be of benefit in its own right. Diversity for its own sake is a positive thing.  That said, the diversity Amazon added to Wheel of Time was a net loss for the story and the show. I'll discuss two examples here: the gender of the potential Dragon Reborn, and the racial diversity of Emond's Field, the Two rivers, and the world writ large. Neither of these additions added more than they detracted from the story, and both were unnecessary. It's been a while since I read the books, so if I miss a detail, let me know. Also, feel free to bring up other examples besides these two.  To start with, gender diversity isn't something lacking in the Wheel of Time. That I can think of now, there are between 6 and 8 main protagonists, depending on where you draw the line; 3 male, and either 3 or 5 female. The rest of the story suffers no shortage of female representation either, the vast majority of the rest of the characters our protagonists interact with are women. The Aes Sedai, by far the most powerful faction of sorts in the world is made up very exclusively of women. A huge percentage of the most important secondary and tertiary characters in the books are from this group, as well as some extremely important female characters we haven't met yet in the show, so I won't discuss them here in the body of the post in order to avoid spoilers. So, when the writers of the show decided to open up the possibility of the Dragon Reborn being a woman, they didn't add a needed element of diversity.  They did, however, muddy a very important detail in the saga of the Dragon Reborn: that the Aes Sedai have been preparing for a Dragon that would not and could not *ever* be one of them. They would never be able to exert direct control of him. For 3000 years the Aes Sedai have planned and plotted and positioned so that when the Dragon Reborn came, they would have the ability to entangle him and create the circumstances they wanted at the end. This also came with the added promise that regardless of who exactly the Dragon Reborn is, their use of the male half of the one power would all but inevitably drive him insane. The debate over how to handle his reemergence was one of the most important and hotly debated topics for millennia. Some thought it would be best to kidnap him, and prevent him from using his abilities until the very end, thus preserving his sanity. Some thought it would be best to try to teach him to resist the insanity, and train him as best they could to harness his strength. While not a huge thing, the hope for the Aes Sedai that they could simply absorb a female Dragon Reborn (as certainly would have been their plan, one which they would have succeeded at) feels like a loss of history and storytelling.   Bigger than that though is the racial diversity the creators foisted upon the Emond's Field and the rest of the world. Like with gender representation, racial representation and diversity isn't in any way missing from the world of Wheel of Time. We visit all parts of the world, and like our own world, each region and country has a predominant race and culture that mirrors those we have here in reality. This is where I might mess some things up, especially given that none of these comparisons are explicitly expressed in the books, but rather easy-to-make inferences based on skin color, culture, and architecture. Tear is largely Arabic, Sheinar is largely southeast Asian, Illian is largely east African, Saldea is largely Persian, Cairhien is largely eastern European, Ghealdon is largely northwest African/Spanish, Andor is largely western European, and the Aiel are largely pre-European colonization North American - albeit with red hair. The list goes on, but I think you get the picture. Of course, very few areas, and especially cities are entirely homogenous, but just like a white person would stick out in Kyoto, a black person would stick out in Amadacia.  The intershuffling of races just wasn't at all necessary, and really took a chunk out of the credibility of one of Moiraine's first important statements, \"The blood of Manetheren runs deep in the Two Rivers.\" The Two Rivers and Especially Emond's Field is *extremely* homogenous. It's a town of only a couple hundred people, and virtually no one ever leaves or moves there. Some people living outside of Emond's Field in the Two Rivers don't even know it exists. How am I supposed to believe that all of the inhabitants of Emond's Field are directly descended from Manetheren when they're all of clearly divergent ancestry? If the creators wanted to say that Manetheren was itself diverse, make everyone in Emond's Field mixed race. Not a difficult solution, and far better for the world building. If you're worried that doing so would make all the protagonists look more or less the same, don't.  More important though, is that for a show that will jump back and forth across the world constantly, diversifying every country on the map makes it a lot harder for the audience to know where the hell the scene on screen is taking place. They have a *ton* of ground to cover, both figuratively and literally, in telling even the very watered down version they plan to.

This an Amazon production, and American company making a show for primarily American audiences. America is an ethnically diverse place where people LIKE to see people like themselves represented on screen. This isn't a conspiracy or woke bullshit, its marketing, its largely liked and the only argument against it is simply that \"I don't believe these are a single ethnic group of people and that makes it harder to believe\".       People will often make this argument and on the surface it seems valid, I myself had those feelings originally when people were bickering about the Witcher's choice to be more diverse, but then once I started thinking more about it I began to realize that we are not very consistent on what we want to be \"accurate\" Cinema and by extension television is never going to be \"accurate\" except perhaps in wartime movies, but even those have many inaccuracies for the sake of watch-ability, cost or convenience. Hiring, shooting, planning shit where everyone has to be ethnically similar is a huge barrier and cost to these shows. You cant just find the best person for the part you have to find the best person for the part that also \"looks ethnically accurate\". Sure in shows with 5-10 primary characters that's fine, but you mentioned yourself ALL the places the show has to go, all the different \"ethnicities\" that would need to be completely homogeneous.   You're in Saldea? Everyone there HAS to be Persian, which means finding dozens/scores of Persian actors TO GET ON SET, multiply that for every single city and every single \"ethnically homogeneous group\". That would take so much more time energy and MONEY and that actually provides very little value, you could argue that doing so would be a huge WASTE of resources because all you're getting is the approval of the most hardcore fans who know exactly what Jordan based those people on.  &#x200B;  Can you honestly say that all the extra time effort and energy to insure all the people were \"ethnically accurate\" would have made the show better at the cost of something else? worse sets, worse costumes, worse actors? They spent every dollar they had to make the show, so if you wanted MORE you have to sacrifice something. What other cost would you have scarified in order to pay for the burden of \"accuracy\"?"}}

I don't understand", "output": "OP, it seems to me you're having some confusion about a few different issues here. Many of them are the biggest questions in philosophy i.e. the question of time, the hard problem of consciousness etc.  However, based on your own description here we can definitely unpack it to help you understand it better.  >Once I die I won't be anything anymore, and my brain won't serve as a host for memories, therefore it will be like I never lived from my perspective.  If we take a phenomenological perspective, i.e. the perspective of 'your' experience, then yes this is true. However, of course if you move slightly beyond subjectivism we'd have to say the other consciousnesses are also aware of your existence. Simondon's theory of psychic-collective individuation would argue that individual consciousnesses never exist without a process that involves other beings. As would the common sense scientific view. Nevertheless, if you're talking about purely your subjective experience this statement is likely true.  >How am I able to be conscious right now and confirm to myself I'm remembering each second if I'm going to die one day? This thought has crept up in my brain for the last 10 years and I always get the same response.  Here's where it gets tricky. Essentially what you're doing here is, as another commenter noted, engaging in what Heidegger called 'projection'. You're imaging the possibility for your non-existence. However, in the case of death, this possibility is a necessity. As beings in the world we all must have the ability to project our non-being, our death. This is an interesting topic to get into but I think it's a little bit different to what you're asking.  Essentially the problem you have here is that you're asking \"if I'm going to die in the future and all my memories will be gone, how can I be sure I exist right now?\" The simple answer is that the projection of your future affects the *quality* of your present experience, but it doesn't determine the *being* of your present experience. In other words, you understanding that you will die, and thus all your memories will disappear etc. affects the way you think about the past, the present and the future, but it isn't the condition for your experience. The fact that you will die (in the future) and stop experiencing/remembering does not mean you have never lived/experienced/remembered in (the present).  Now personally, I think you're probably trying to get at something that is a little more complicated than the way you've laid it out here (I've read through your comments too). Imo, my best advice would be to perhaps watch some videos on Heidegger's ideas of projection and death. Check out the Stanford entry on Heidegger.  For a counter perspective, and one you might find quite interesting given how you seem to be looking for an ontological concept of memory, you should have a look into Bergson. His book Matter and Memory is explicitly concerned with the questions you're asking. Bergson distinguishes recollection from 'pure memory' which is essentially like an objective past where all things go once they pass from the present (as you said).  The great thing about philosophy is that many questions you have about the nature of consciousness or time or anything else have likely been thought out in a lot of detail by philosophers throughout history. If you're willing to devote a little time to trying to understand your own question through philosophy you might find the answers you're looking for."}}

In a certain sense, that\u2019s just where it happened; that\u2019s where all the right variables and factors aligned to produce the specific outcome. It goes without saying thats where our ancestors were (where they evolved), so that obviously paved the way for humans. Homo sapiens are part of a long chain of the Homo genus, most of which happened to be present in and around Sub-Saharan Africa. Homo sapiens began as a small band that became more successful over time, ultimately outperforming members of its same genus. It would\u2019ve been impossible for groups of sapiens to spawn simultaneously around the globe because the exact same ancestral chain would\u2019ve also had to exist in other continents.   All continents, while wildly different, also have many similar climatological and geological characteristics across space, so I\u2019m not sure there are any profound arguments as to what makes that region particularly special (I could be wrong). My understanding of human migration is we originated in East, Sub-Saharan Africa (conducive to any life with its diversity of flora and fauna, as well as the accessibility of water) and subsequently migrated out of Africa to modern day Asia, over the Bering Strait and into the Americas. Although as of late, the Bering Strait Theory has come into major question, newer theories of human migration into the Americas would still follow the same sort of patterns, but would include the use of maritime technology that was previously considered nonexistent for that respective time period. The great thing about Anthropology  and Archeology is there are always new discoveries that transform our own history, and who knows, maybe one day we\u2019ll learn how humans actually originated in South America or something.

I made a sample last weekend for my husband and I to try to make sure it would be good, but it was not.  I'm looking for help.  My problems:  My friend gave me a bag of frozen, cooked shrimp to use for the salad.  We thought the shrimp was blah flavored and a little tough.  I don't mind cooking my own frozen shrimp, or buying fresh, if suggested.  I did NOT use the crushed red pepper flakes in the vinaigrette, just because we don't like stuff too spicy.

I'd suggest brining the shrimp in a salt&sugar solution to perk up their flavor; it should work even with pre-cooked shrimp so try that before buying replacements.

Ok, I almost guarantee this has been posted on here before but after I skimmed the \u201cnew\u201d section for a few minutes I didn\u2019t see it so I figured sure why not.   I\u2019m gonna start this by saying I completely stand behind BLM and the peaceful protests across America and the world in their fight for equal rights and just protection under the law. I think there are many instances of police brutality and blatant homicide by LEO but this is not a very good example. Im just gonna break it down from my POV to start. the confrontation started with them politely asking a man to move his car out of the drive through because it was in the way of everyone else. After he failed a sobriety test, clearly showing he was drunk, they did what they\u2019re taught to do and calmly tell him he\u2019s under arrest and that he needs to come with them. As they surround him to put him in handcuffs, not showing any kind of aggression or hostility that is common among LEO, he tries to shake both of them off.   He proceeds to physically engage both officers, punching them and throwing them off him, they discharge their tasers but he seems relatively unaffected. He then steals one and manages to get by both officers, running away. He points the taser at the officer chasing him and the officer shoots him to stop him.   It\u2019s tragic, no doubt, and to be fair I\u2019m not even trying to defend the officer, he deserves some reprimand for his actions but he shouldn\u2019t be charged with multiple, serious offenses leading to many years of jail time. I think yes, the situation could\u2019ve been handled much better, and he should be fired for his hasty actions but I think there is a place where we need to draw the line.   In my eyes, the officer, highly trained and armed, is taught to stop the criminal no matter what, in his eyes, this man just drove drunk, assaulted two officers, stole a taser, and attempted to discharge the weapon on another officer. A weapon that has been described by the state as potentially deadly and which, he has been told to take as a direct threat. I don\u2019t think this is not so much on the officer rather the system and the state.   I\u2019m not trying to discredit the protests or their fight, nor even this mans life. I completely respect all of those, but I mean, what was he supposed to do? He didn\u2019t have a secondary weapon, he wasn\u2019t likely to catch him on foot, I think, again, it\u2019s excessive, and he should be fired, but his alternatives was to watch a criminal run away with a \u201clethal\u201d weapon. You can even hear him on the video trying to say things to brooks like \u201cstay with me\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t stop breathing\u201d so I definitely don\u2019t think it\u2019s a lack of moral or humanity on the part of the officer.   Tbh I\u2019ve had it explained so many different ways, I\u2019m not even sure what to think rn, but this is the best way I think I can put it from my view. Feel free to completely discredit me, I welcome any and all criticism, if with some hesitation, as that\u2019s how we grow as people. Thank you for attending my TED talk.", "output": "I recently took a firearms course to be a licensed armed guard. The teacher was former LE and he sort of explained what happens with the mind when experiencing a situation like this. So say for example you are a armed guard/officer and you are patrolling an area, suddenly a person with an unidentified object appears and seems erratic. Suddenly the person begins shooting before you have an opportunity to gauge what exactly is in this guy's hand so your brain tells you, I need to shoot or else myself or someone else will get hurt or killed. Once you have begun the action your brain has a sort of delay to where stopping while performing the action won't be possible until maybe 2 or 3 seconds afterward. My thinking is that when Rayshard had fired off the taser at the police officers the officer who began to fire was experiencing this mental delay. Rayshard begins to turn and run and the officer shoots. A lot went wrong that night, and there definitely needs to be reform with police departments nationwide.

I think my experiences are typical of the kind you find in ethnic Asian neighborhoods.  > What ingredients are worth making the trip for?   * Some of the more common ingredients are so cheap at the Asian markets around here. I mean, I can stumble into any supermarket and pick up tofu, but at the Asian markets, I can grab a block for just over a dollar. Also being charged 50 cents for a bundle of green onions at the local market feels like I'm being cheated out of my money, because at the Asian markets I'm paying 10 cents per bundle.   * Fish. Yeah I know it smells. But unless I feel like waaaaay overpaying by going to a fisherman's market, I can't get fresher fish. The fish at the 99 Ranch around here is usually fresher than the ones at the local Whole Foods. Also, I like to buy whole fish or fish heads - things I can't typically seem to get at any western market. And again, the price can't be beat - one big salmon head will be enough to make a huge pot of spicy fish head stew that will feed a family of four, and it would cost me maybe four dollars.   * Then you get the more obscure ingredients that you can't find anywhere else. I'll just list a few of the things I picked up during my last trip there that I don't think I can find at the neighborhood Albertsons: Black wood ear fungus, preserved chili tofu, kong xin cai, uncooked boba, tong hao cai (which are amongst my favorite ingredients to throw into a hot pot by the way), spicy bean paste.   * Baked goods. I'm a huge fan of various buns stuffed with taro, pork sung, red bean, and various custards and creams, and the coconut toast I can pick up at the 99 ranch makes for amazing French toast when dried out over night.   > Do you have advice on soliciting help from staff with whom you don't share a language?   In my experience, you'll have better luck with asking other customers that look like they know what they're doing. If you know exactly what you want, and they can understand you, the employees will be more than happy to help you out.

{"item": {"input": "Can I do an overnight rise for all bread doughs? I like the idea of doing a cold rise for my bread since it spreads out the work over a couple of days instead of 1. I know you have to let the dough rise once, then again after shaping.  My questions: Can I just stick any bread dough in the fridge for an overnight bulk fermentation (then shape and proof again at room temp the next day). Will I have to adjust the recipe? Could I also shape them and keep in the fridge overnight? How long is too long in the fridge?   New to bread, so lots of questions... thanks!", "output": "You can, but your results will vary. Some bread doughs are more delicate and won't be very happy after a night in the fridge. Some doughs aren't designed for the flavor development that happens with long proofs.   For most doughs, the best way to overnight proof is after shaping, though. Bulk proof, divide and shape, then refrigerate. The reason for this is the purpose of the first proof is to allow the yeast to start developing. Yeast develops exponentially and restricting that growth early in the process (like by refrigerating) can kill off so much of the yeast that there isn't enough left to rise the bread.  I would not leave your bread under refrigeration for more than 48 hours but 24 would be preferred. Over 24 and you'll start seeing more signs of aging, slower proofing, and less oven spring.  Once you remove your bread from refrigeration, you want to let it come to room temperature and finish rising if necessary. Depending on the temperature of your fridge and how active your dough is, you may not need to let it rise any further."}}

Kids are still bullied, ostracized and dehumanized just as much today as they were in 1999. It's been 20 years and we've tried to blame video games, mental health and gun accessibility. We still haven't addressed the core issued: People being dicks to each other.  Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, Red Lake, Columbine and now Parkland. These shootings aren't being done by the popular starting football quarterback. They're being done by the guy who is pushed in the hallway. They guy who is laughed at, or worse, when he dares to smile at or talk to a girl. The guy who teachers would rather exclude from the classroom than reach out to and help.  More succinctly, the guy who is treated like a bug being squashed on the sidewalk, rather than being treated as an actual human being.  If the other students made a point to include that person in life, rather than continuing to ostracize, mock and humiliate him, the likelihood of him shooting up the school is going to drop significantly.  Invite him over to play video games.  Ask him to join you at McDonald's after the game.  Be a positive influence in his life.  Kids that are included in high school life don't shoot up the school.  Kids that have a friend group don't shoot up the school.  Kids that are treated as human beings don't shoot up the school.

You advocate that people put up with this, not ostracize him, force themselves to spend time with him, etc. Have you considered that if they give up and can't take his cruel behavior anymore, THEY will be the direct targets because *they* knew the shooter best and were the ones who \"betrayed\" him? That they've made themselves and their school the target, instead of someone or somewhere else?  It's also worth considering that the social ostracization that occurs if you're the nutcase who brings drugs or a gun/knife to school serves as a deterrent.

He was originally a foster who had \u201cpneumonia\u201d but when he wasn\u2019t improving I adopted him so I could take over his medical care.   After seeing 4 vets, including specialists, multiple xrays, blood work, and cardiology appointments, it was determined that he has an entire host of congenital defects. His lungs completely lack blood flow in the front, his heart has a bad valve, he has bone marrow issues, and kidney issues.   The thing is, he behaves like he\u2019s perfectly fine. He plays and runs and jumps and purrs. He\u2019s adorable and full of fun. The vet said he behaves this way because his defects are all he\u2019s ever known so he is used to feeling bad. But the vet also said that as he grows, his body will struggle more and that he is a ticking time bomb for catastrophic health failure and that he likely wouldn\u2019t die instantly but suffer before we could get him to the vet.

From the language in your post, it seems like you understand euthanasia is going to be the most likely end for Bubbles. If his body could fail at any moment now, the stressors of continued growth and development could very well cause his physical condition and pain level deteriorate. Your vet said much the same, so I won't dwell on that any longer.   As a vet tech I feel, for cases in which the animal's condition will never improve beyond their current state, the most humane option is to euthanize early. This sounds very harsh, and I apologize again, but at this stage you are still able to control for their level of happiness and make at least one, final day of good memories. You can still give them special meals, take them to their favorite places, and simply sit, quietly, and hold them while they sleep. A person's animal doesn't know or understand why these things are happening to them, but they do understand the depth of their person's love. These things are no longer possible when that animal comes to us as an emergency, and I think the absence of those final, good memories makes it much more difficult for an animal's person to find closure.   The final decision remains yours, in the end. You seem to have a lot of empathy for Bubbles' condition, and your heart will tell you what is right. If you do decide euthanasia is the best course of action for Bubbles, please understand that we will be with you every step of the way. We will do our best to make the environment safe and comfortable, and we will wait until you are truly ready before we begin.

Everybody cries, it never gets any easier, and we never forget the animals we help cross the bridge - but we will carry the burden together, knowing their time was peaceful and loving rather than scary or painful.

I want to truthfully advertise its longer-than-average lifespan as a way of increasing sales and justifying a higher price tag, so I need to get evidence for its actual expected lifespan.   I could make several machines and run them continuously for 20-years equivalent use, but it would take me over a year to assess (~10 hours use per week; 10*52*20= 10,400 hours = 432 days) Is there a quicker way to accurately predict the average lifespan that won't delay my new product launch by 14 months?  I read the wiki on Weibull statistics and honestly got lost in the math. I also read the wiki on reliability engineering but, without going down the Wikipedia rabbit hole, I couldn't find out *how much* faster a manufacturer could assess time-to-failure than by simply running the machine for thousands of hours.", "output": "I worked for an automotive R&D center for 6 years and then consumer good development for 4 years after that and have some insight on each.  First, automotive there are a few different types of failures.  UV testing, corrosion testing, and other environmental can be highly accelerated and design and manufacturing guidelines developed to ensure reliability.  Salt spray and UV booths can put years of damage into parts in days.  And processes like submerging the entire frame in the coating can ensure far better coverage than a human with a spray gun.  UV can be negated with additives in plastic which is ensured with things like the company developing their own plastic mixes and providing it to the supplier instead of trusting the supplier to source a material that meets the spec.  Mechanical components are a bit trickier but can be tested on a test jig every few seconds instead of once per day or so.  So a damper on a glove box to shocks on the suspension will have performance data from suppliers with a good track record and extensive documentation.  A new variation won\u2019t have as much of its own specific testing but it can be compared to older models on a part by part and overall basis to determine what weak points might have been introduced.  Something like engines are often essentially designed to practically never wear out.  Any parts that will wear will have a maintenance schedule, and something like the engine block should ideally never fail under normal operation.  No company is going to design an engine on a car to wear out  at 150,000 miles just because the warranty ends at 100,000 miles.  The risk or early failure and bad reputation is nowhere near being worth the amount they would save skimping on materials and quality.  On the opposite end of that spectrum, emergency jacks are called emergency jacks for a reason, they are really just intended for emergencies and are sometimes rated for as few as 20 uses since they should only ever be used for changing a time.  Now likely most of them will last longer than that to ensure that most will hit that number safely, but for parts like that it isn\u2019t worth the cost and weight to put something more robust in when that cost and weight can be used elsewhere.  For home goods, I would perform a lifespan calculation based on expected frequency of use and expected longevity of the product from a consumer standpoint.  If you buy a blender and use it once per week, you probably expect that thing to last decades.  If you are crushing ice and mixing thick smoothies 4 times per day every day all year, and you buy a basic consumer version, you will probably understand if it wears out in a couple years.  If you buy a high end professional grade one, you expect that to last for decades.  Now if you open a smoothie shop at a mall and make smoothies nonstop for 12 hours per day 7 days per week,  no company is going to honor the consumer rated warranty and you will probably be replacing that thing every year or so.  Try that with a cheap consumer model and you might kill it in the first day or week.  If It is a brushed motor that is a fairly easy measurement.  Are the brushes consumer replaceable?

The question implies an inherent flaw in reasoning, i.e. that something external to individual action should prevent bad things from happening. In driving in a system with multiple independent parties, it only works if everyone follows the established rules and pays attention. No one should ever make a lane change without indicating, and no one should ever make a lane change without verifying that it's open. And you should continue to pay attention to what you're doing while you're doing it. If everyone actually did this, then there wouldn't be accidents caused by this scenario, even if there are some near misses. Any accident resulting from this scenario is caused by a failure on one of these points, or from equipment failure."}}

It's non-trivial and probably requires one hell of a lot of background.   But what the hell. It's a slow afternoon.  The \"dialectical\" part is a reference to Hegel's notion of \"the dialectic.\" Hegel advanced the idea that history is essentially the process of \"Geist\"--the ghost/spirit/mind/consciousness of the world--towards a state of absolute, ultimate, perfect knowledge of itself, the \"universal order\". It does this by the process of the \"dialectic,\" in which one notion (the \"thesis\") is met by a contrary/opposing notion (the \"antithesis\"), and the tension between the two is resolved/merged into a new notion (the \"synthesis\") which in turn becomes the next \"thesis\".  It's not important for you to necessarily get all of that. Hegel is nothing if not dense. What's important to understand is that Hegel thinks that history is essentially an *idealistic* story, in the sense of \"having to do with ideas,\" or at the very least, \"not having to do with physical objects\".  Marx, born about a decade after Hegel published *Phenomenology of Geist*, was a student of Hegelian philosophy. In ridiculously simple terms, Marx took Hegel's notion about the development of history but located that development in the *material* realm rather than the realm of the *ideal*. So for Marx, history is not a story of the development of the \"world spirit,\" but the *material* organization of society, and in particular the progress of class struggle over the means of production. Marx's historiography (and Marxist historiography generally) became known as \"historical materialism,\" the point being to contrast it with Hegel's own views, which might be fairly described as \"historical *idealism*\". Marx (and Engels, for that matter) still wanted to talk about this progression using the \"dialectic\" terminology, though there are various ways of translating Hegel's notions from the realm of the ideal to the realm of the material.   So what's \"dialectical materialism\" then? The term is most commonly used to refer to the version of historical materialism developed primarily in the Soviet Union and epitomized in the writings of Joseph Stalin in the 1930s. It incorporates developments in Marxist thought from the intervening decades since Marx and Engels first started publishing (the late 1840s, basically), including ideas from Lenin and Lukacs as well as Marx and Engels."}}

They kept trying to trip me up in a \u201clie\u201d and I was so confused while they were using dumb police interrogation tactics.  Only me and my 10 year old child live here and they broke his bedroom window which was near my head when I fell asleep in his room but thankfully no cuts in my face. Just my foot and almost my cats paws. As they\u2019re storming my apartment shouting for \u201cLarry so and so\u201d they\u2019re asking me where my child is what his name is what his dads name is and his dads address and all kinds of crazy sh*t!

They also lied and said that they broke 1 window pane and failed to mention that they broke both but also bent up the screen.

{"item": {"input": "Dumb question about car engineering - could you use a flywheel to 'store' energy from the engine, for later use to help accelerate faster? I'm not talking about regenerative braking.  RB uses the brakes to spin up a flywheel.  I'm talking about using an engine to spin up a flywheel.  ---  I was watching some car modding videos today when a thought struck me.  No, I'm not interested in doing this myself.  I'm not even a car guy.  More than anything, I'm wondering why this *isn't* done in racing situations.  I imagine the answer is that it would be too heavy to provide any benefit.  Suppose you're designing a racing car.  The car will be racing in a race where there are periods during which it's *not* accelerating.   - For example - a drag race, where a car sits for *minutes* doing nothing at the starting line, before having to rapidly accelerate.  - For example - a rally, where there are periods when a car's engine has the *capacity* to accelerate more but the driver momentarily wishes to keep the car slower for more control; followed by other periods where the driver wishes to accelerate faster than the engine can allow.  Now suppose you connect the car's engine to a flywheel as well as the car's wheels.  The engine can send the entirety of its power to the wheels by temporarily disconnecting the flywheel.  Somehow, it can also power the wheels a little bit while also spinning up the flywheel.  When the driver requires it, the flywheel can be connected to the wheels, relieving it of its own momentum to spin up the wheels even more.     - On a race's starting line, a driver would use the car's engine to spin up the flywheel.  The moment the lights go green, the driver steps on the gas.  The car's computer connects the engine and the flywheel to the wheels.  The momentum stored in the flywheel allows the car to accelerate much faster than a normal car, whose wheels can only be driven by the engine alone.  - During a period of a rally race where the driver needs to control their speed, the engine might rev up faster than it normally would, for the speed the car's travelling at.  The extra power is sent to the flywheel to spin it up.  The momentum of the flywheel could be used later to help the car accelerate faster when necessary.  This would be similar to regenerative braking, except instead of using the brakes to power the flywheel the engine itself would be used to power the flywheel.    My questions are:   - Is this possible, or is it really dumb?  - Why aren't these systems used in real life?  Is it due to the engineering complexity?  Due to the mass of the flywheel?  - Are there any other places it could be used?  (For example - perhaps it's too heavy for a racing car, but could be useful in a tank.)", "output": "This has been tried in buses in the 40s but they were discontinued as there are too many problems with high velocity spinning heavy wheels of death and unwanted gyroscopic forces."}}

I'm an EE with 7years experience and am stuck in my career, any advice would be appreciated.  **TLDR**: Are there jobs that involve challenging EE work instead of the bureaucratic nightmare that I'm currently trapped in? and how do I find them?  **Background**: I left my previous company after a year of doing near zero engineering work, in my new company I'm finding myself in the same situation.   **Experiences**: In my first job out of college I was writing firmware, designing 12-layer PCBs, troubleshooting at the component level, all my time was spent reading datasheets, it was great, but the pay was terrible and nowhere else to go within the company, so I moved on.  Since leaving that position, both companies I have been with since have had great pay, but the engineering work and internal bureaucracies are a joke.  Both job descriptions listed out the kinds of things I wanted to do, but I'm doing none of those.  From what I can see, any engineering work that does happen is completely hamstrung by mismanagement and internal bureaucracy.  I spend my time waiting for work and attending meetings where no one can determine an owner for otherwise very (VERY) simple problems that drag on for months.  I'm bored, not learning anything, and frustrated by the inefficiency.    **Example**: We need a very basic PDU to upgrade a station.  I spec'd out the PDU (real straight forward).  I'm now a dozen meetings and two months in and I'm still giving presentations on it, not about technical requirements (no one wants to hear those) but because I need to explain that there is an old PDU, and due to internal standards, we need a new one.  I did this at my previous job, and I'm doing it again at my current one, I'm losing my mind.  **Current Outlook**:  I realize that I'm new to the company, not going to get the fun projects right away, but I am in the meetings where they are discussed.  The work is spread out over a committee people who'd rather spend more time shrugging their shoulders than having any technical discussion.  Any mention of this to management has been met with enigmatic \"work is coming\" with no elaboration or plans to prepare for that work.  **Future plans**: I don't want to make a habit of jumping jobs, that's no good for a resume, but I can't deal with the boredom, and feeling my skills languish from lack of use is killing me.   How do I find a job with challenging technical problems and the agency to solve them?  I'm considering going back to school, but haven't determined if that will help.

In applying for a flair, you are claiming to have:  * **Expertise in an area of history**, typically from either degree-level academic experience or an equivalent amount of self-study. For more exploration of this, check out this thread.  * The ability to **cite sources** from specialist literature for any claims you make within your area.  * The ability to provide **high quality answers** in the subreddit in accordance with our rules.    For a more in-depth look at how applications are analyzed, consult this helpful guide on our wiki explaining what an answer that demonstrates the above looks like.  **How to apply**  To apply for a flair, simply post in this thread. Your post needs to include:  * Links to **3-5 comments** in /r/AskHistorians that show you meet the above requirements, and of which at least three were posted in the last six months. Answers linked in an application should go 'above and beyond' the base requirements of the rules here, and reflect the depth of your expertise.  * The **text of your flair** and which category it belongs in (see the sidebar). Be as specific as possible as we prefer flair to reflect the exact area of your expertise as near as possible, but be aware there is a limit of 64 characters.  One of the moderators will then either confirm your flair or, if the application doesn't adequately show you meet the requirements, explain what's missing. If you get rejected, don't despair! We're happy to give you advice and pointers on how to improve your portfolio for a future application. Plenty of panelists weren't approved the first time.  If there's a backlog this may take a few days but we will try to get around to everyone as quickly as possible.  **\"I'm an Expert About Something But Never Have a Chance to Write About It!\"**  Some topics only come up once in a blue moon, but that doesn't mean you can't still get flair in it! There are a number of avenues to follow, many of which are dealt with in greater detail at the last section of this thread.  **Expected Behavior**  We invest a large amount of trust in the flaired members of /r/askhistorians, as they represent the subreddit when answering questions, participating in AMAs, and even in their participation across reddit as a whole. As such, we do take into account an applicant's user history reddit-wide when reviewing an application, and will reject applicants whose post history demonstrate bigotry, racism, or sexism. Such behavior is not tolerated in /r/askhistorians, and we do not tolerate it from our panelists in any capacity. We additionally reserve the right to revoke flair based on evidence of such behavior after the application process has been completed. /r/AskHistorians is a safe space for everyone, and those attitudes have no place here.  **Quality Contributors**  If you see an unflaired user consistently giving excellent answers, they can be nominated for a \"Quality Contributor\" flair. Just message the mods their username and some example comments which you believe meet the above criteria.  **FAQ Finder**   To apply for FAQ finder, we require demonstration of a consistent history of community involvement and linking to previous responses and the FAQ. We expect to see potential FAQ Finders be discerning in what they link to, ensuring that it is to threads which represent the current standards of the subreddit, and they do so in a polite and courteous manner, both to the 'Asker', and also by including a username ping of the original 'Answerer'.  **Revoking Flair**  Having a flair brings with it a greater expectation to abide by the subreddit's rules and maintain the high standard of discussion we all like to see here. The mods will revoke the flair of anybody who continually breaks the rules, fails to meet the standard for answers in their area of expertise, or violates the above mentioned expectations. Happily, we almost never have to do this.  **Additional Resources**  Before applying for flair, we encourage you to check out these resources to help you with the application process:  * Our Rules Roundtable on 'Expertise' and the Flair Application Process * Our Wiki Guide on what makes a good application * The Previous Application Threads, to see what makes for successful - and not successful - applications.  * The Sunday Digest, and Monthly Awards which can provide many examples of we are looking for regarding the caliber of flaired users.", "output": "Hi AskHistorians, I would like to apply for a flair under the title of \"Modern Maghrib / French Colonialism and Imperialism,\" which for me would fit better under a mix of the categories of \"Middle East\" and \"Africa.\"  Here are my responses:  * Why did decolonization happen primarily after World War 2, instead of during the World Wars? * Where did the descendants of European colonists tend to go after colonies became independent countries during the 2nd half of the 20th century? * What was Vichy rule like in the French colonies, especially distant ones like Indochina?  Thank you for your consideration!"}}
{"item": {"input": "What is it like to leave academia? I get the sense that most of this sub is geared toward university PhD professors/post-docs/grad students so I am in a little bit of a different position but I think a lot of the same values, positives, and negatives of academia apply so I am looking for any thoughts from similarly  academically-minded people.  &#x200B;  I am currently finishing my medical residency (rough equivalent of post-doc). Like many of you, I have been in academia my whole life and been rewarded so far with opportunities, praise, respect, grants, etc. But I am at a career crossroads now that I have to get my first \"real\" job. The two jobs are probably more similar than they are different in the grand scheme of things given that my main role will be seeing patients either way. The main differences are the environment, autonomy, and pay.   &#x200B;  The two jobs:  \\--Academic job: 20-30% research time, 70% seeing patients, teaching, and administrative duties. Somewhat more flexible lifestyle due to culture and slower pace (45-50 hours/week). Pay starts at 300k/year and may rise slowly over the next 10-15 years. I am lukewarm about my research but could continue it. The main benefit is getting to stay in an intellectually engaging environment at a top institution for my field, and one where I am comfortable having been in the academic environment for almost 20 years.   \\--Private job: 100% seeing patients every day, can be a bit of a grind (55-60 hours/week). Pay starts higher (maybe 400-450k/year) and will rise quickly for 2 years to 600-800k/year, and then slowly rise after that as I get more efficient over time and/or with inflation.  Main benefit is the money, lack of having research projects hang over my head (and having to bring work home with me). Possible downsides are missing the intellectual side of academia and the longer-term outlook that comes with research (i.e. every day/week/month is going to be the same in broad strokes, I'll be doing the same thing in August 2030 as I am in August 2020).   &#x200B;  Has anyone on this sub left academia after years of being in academia and succeeding at it? I feel like I may be throwing away an opportunity that so many want and so few get.", "output": "This is probably a better question for the medicine subreddit. Personally, I find the quality of life difference between $300K and $500K to be \u201cmeh,\u201d and would place greater value on how happy you\u2019d be in either role. Also, may I ask what specialty you\u2019re in?"}}
{"item": {"input": "What to do with leftover baked goods when you live alone? I live alone and baking is one of my favorite ways to relieve stress.   As a particularly heavy academic season is setting in I am baking two or three times a week.   The problem is my college is remote right now so I don\u2019t have any friends to share my baked goods with and I live alone.   There isn\u2019t anywhere to donate baked goods to near here (they only accept packaged foods for safety reasons.)   I can\u2019t eat two dozen cupcakes every week but I also feel very badly throwing away perfectly good food.   Anyone have workarounds for this?   Thank you in advance!", "output": "As a long time postal worker I can safely say that you could drop off at the depot or just give some to your letter carrier.  It\u2019s a nice thing to get a sweet snack while out on a route.  It wouldn\u2019t hurt to meet your letter carrier the first time so they can know what to expect.  Leaving out cold water, soda, juice or energy drinks is nice too."}}
